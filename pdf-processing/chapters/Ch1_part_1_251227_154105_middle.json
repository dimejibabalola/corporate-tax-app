Legal advisors to the earliest American corporations spent much of their time defining the relationship between the corporation and the state and developing hoary doctrines to regulate corporate governance and control. It was not until late in the 19th century that the genteel world of corporate law was jolted by the emergence of the income tax as a principal government revenue raising device. The life of the corporate lawyer would never be the same again. From the ill-fated Income Tax of 1894, which at the time was viewed as a Socialist plot because it imposed a two percent tax on individual and corporate net income,[1] to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909, which imposed a modest one percent tax on corporate net income over \\(5,000,[2] to the Sixteenth Amendment and beyond, the income tax gradually came to influence how corporations conducted their affairs. It is now well acknowledged, though often lamented, that taxes have invaded virtually every aspect of American business life. They shape and often twist management decisions and generally are an unpleasant distraction to those who would prefer to devote their full resources to the pursuit of profit."

Congress, having decided to treat the corporation as a separate taxpaying entity, went on to craft what has become known as a \"double tax regime.\"4 Under current law, a corporate tax is imposed annually, at the 21 percent flat rate set forth in Section 11, on the taxable income of a corporation. That income is taxed again if and when a corporation distributes dividends to its shareholders. Those dividends are not deductible by the distributing corporation but are taxed to its shareholders at rates that vary depending on whether the shareholder is an individual or a corporation, and they are not taxed at all to tax-exempt shareholders such as charities and retirement funds.5 Because the corporation is treated as a separate taxable entity, transactions between corporations and their shareholders are taxable events unless they qualify for nonrecognition treatment. The tax consequences of these transactions and other major changes and adjustments in a corporation are governed by Subchapter C (Sections 301 to 385) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a challenging and fascinating body of law that is the principal subject of this book. Corporations subject to the double tax regime also draw their identity (and monogram) from Subchapter C. Collectively, the Code refers to them as \"C corporations.\"6"

For example, should the corporate income tax apply not only to operating profits but also to distributions of appreciated property and sales in connection with corporate liquidations? The outcome of this controversy will unfold as these and other transactions are studied later in this text. For now, it is sufficient to observe that the defenders of the corporate income tax largely prevailed on these questions in piecemeal legislation culminating with the Tax Reform of 1986. The results were a strengthened double tax regime, an increase in the tax costs of operating a profitable business as a C corporation, and greater pressure on techniques to reduce these costs."

And then, after many years of discussion, the 2016 election results opened the gates to the enactment in 2017 of legislation popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.[23] The 2017 Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and made numerous other changes that largely benefit business taxpayers. Its implications on taxpayer behavior will be addressed throughout this chapter."

The origins of the LLC in the United States can be traced to the search by foreign investors in the oil and gas industry for a U.S. business entity that would combine limited liability protection for all owners with one level of taxation. Because nonresident aliens may not own stock in an S corporation, the investors' objectives could not be met using the corporate form. So they began lobbying state legislatures, and by the late 1970s Wyoming had enacted the first domestic limited liability company statute.[24] LLCs were not practically viable, however, until the Internal Revenue Service ruled, first privately and then in a 1989 published ruling, that a Wyoming LLC would be treated as a partnership rather than a corporation for tax purposes.[25]"

For much of our tax history, the policy decision to tax long-term capital gains at substantially lower rates than ordinary income influenced the tax planner's agenda. Rather than paying dividends, tax advisors devised techniques to \"bail out\" earnings at capital gains rates. A \"bailout\" was a distribution of earnings in a transaction, such as a redemption of stock, that qualifies as a \"sale or exchange,\" enabling the shareholder to recover all or part of her stock basis and to benefit from preferential capital gain treatment on any realized gain. In some cases, such as where the shareholder died and the basis of her stock was stepped up to its date-of-death value, the bailout could be accomplished tax-free.[28] Over the years, Congress responded with complex anti-bailout provisions to ensure that distributions resembling dividends would be taxed as ordinary income.[29]"

Under the current rate structure, the tax goal of a bailout would not be to convert dividend income to capital gain but rather to enable shareholders to recover all or part of the basis in their stock. Only if capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate than dividends, as could happen if Congress changes its mind again in the future, would a bailout reassume its role as a strategy to reduce the double tax on C corporations and their shareholders and make some of the topics covered in this course much more compelling."

Under the realization principle, gains and losses are not taxable until they are realized in a sale, exchange or other event that makes the gain or loss \"real\" and more easily measurable. The nonrecognition concept assumes that certain realization events should not be impeded by the imposition of a tax. Transactions that qualify for nonrecognition treatment may go forward on a tax-free basis on the theory that they are mere changes in form resulting in a continuity of investment. To ensure that any realized gain or loss is merely deferred rather than eliminated, the typical nonrecognition provision includes corollary rules providing for transferred and exchanged bases and tacked holding periods.[30] A familiar example from basic income tax is a Section 1031 like-kind exchange. The nonrecognition principle pervades Subchapter C, affecting transactions ranging from the simple corporate formation to complex mergers and acquisitions."

Taxpayers thus may be encouraged to structure sales of a corporate business to come within an applicable nonrecognition provision in order to avoid (or at least defer) tax at the corporate and shareholder levels."

Additionally, the U.S. historically has taxed its domestic corporations on their worldwide income with a limited tax credit for foreign income taxes paid, while many developed countries tax their corporations only on income earned from sources within the country. Under the \"territorial\" system of many foreign countries, income earned abroad from an active business generally bears no additional tax when it is repatriated to the home country."

Suppose a foreign corporation has a low effective tax rate and under its country's tax laws it is allowed to return overseas profits without additional tax. If that company wants to expand, a U.S. firm with overseas businesses may be an attractive partner. The foreign corporate suitor would look to (1) reduce the effective tax rate on the U.S. partner's future overseas business profits, and (2) repatriate the U.S. corporation's locked-out profits without additional tax. The point is that these strategies often made a U.S. company with foreign operations a more attractive acquisition target for a foreign corporation than a potential domestic suitor. Some highly publicized takeovers of U.S. firms by foreign corporations have involved Canadian companies, including ones in the pharmaceutical industry and the acquisition of Burger King by the Tim Horton chain. Canada generally does not tax overseas business profits, and it often allows repatriation of foreign profits without additional tax. While these acquisitions arguably had a business justification, it is also clear that tax advantages were sought to improve after-tax returns.[37] Although the IRS attempted to curb inversions by making the desired tax benefits more difficult to achieve,[38] resourceful tax advisors devised methods to circumvent these administrative obstacles."

One school of thought is that \"loopholes\" should be closed and legislation should be enacted to make it more difficult to reclassify U.S. entities or operations as \"foreign\" and escape the U.S. tax system. In the previous edition of this text, we noted that other suggested approaches included reducing corporate tax rates and ending the incentive for lock-out of foreign profits and predicted the possibility of legislation as part of a more comprehensive tax reform effort. The 2017 Act did not disappoint. In addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate, major changes were made to the taxation of foreign income earned by U.S. corporations by the adoption of a modified territorial system of taxation, the creation of a new tax subsidy for exports by U.S. corporations, and the imposition of a mandatory repatriation tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings.[39] A principal goal of the 2017 legislation was to rebalance the Code's tax incentives to encourage U.S. and foreign corporations to conduct more of their operations in the United States. Time will tell whether these changes successfully alter corporate behavior."

Consider the following questions, which focus on fundamental structural issues that were not addressed in the 2017 Act. Why does the Internal Revenue Code have two separate pass-through tax regimes for closely held business enterprises, one (Subchapter K) for partnerships and LLCs and the other (Subchapter S) for certain corporations, each with different qualification standards and operative provisions?40 If a single pass-through regime were adopted, would Subchapter K be preferable to Subchapter S, or would some combination of the two be the best approach?41 Why are C corporations singled out for a double tax regime? Is it because they enjoy limited liability under state law? Presumably not, because most LLCs are not subject to Subchapter C. Does the rise of the LLC undermine the policy underlying the double tax and threaten to destroy the corporate tax base? Would it make more sense to limit Subchapter C to large corporations (based on revenues) or publicly traded entities? Or should there be a single one-tier tax regime for all business income without regard to the organizational form?42 And how would U.S. multinational corporations be taxed under a revised regime?"

In deciding how their new business will be taxed, the founders are presented with three options: (1) the pass-through tax treatment offered to partnerships and limited liability companies by Subchapter K; (2) taxation of a corporation as a separate entity under Subchapter C, with a second level of tax if and when earnings are distributed to shareholders or the business is sold; or (3) the pass-through treatment offered to corporations by Subchapter S. Choosing among these options requires a multifaceted cost/benefit analysis that is sensitive to changes in the tax law and, most recently, was profoundly affected by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."

Where limited liability is essential, it can be achieved in a corporation, a limited liability company, or a limited partnership with a corporate general partner. In the many situations where state law provides flexibility to achieve these and other nontax goals, tax considerations often will influence the choice of entity decision. In evaluating the options, three critical questions are: (1) who will own the business and what type of economic relationship among them is contemplated; (2) how and when do the owners intend to realize a return on their investment (e.g., by making current distributions, or through a sale, public offering, or other exit strategy); and (3) is the business initially expected to generate losses and for how long?44 In making the decision, the threshold tax question is whether to use a C corporation or a pass-through entity and, if the latter, whether it should be a partnership, LLC or S corporation."

But in many situations,the modest rate advantage for C corporations was outweighed by the fact that pass-through entities are subject to only one level of tax. These relationships were radically altered by the 2017 Act, where Congress rejected eliminating the double tax regime applicable to C corporations and instead moderated its bite by lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent-a 40 percent decrease from the top 35 percent rate that had been in place for many years. As enacted,this rate cut is said to be permanent in the sense that it will not automatically expire after a certain period of time but, of course, nothing is ever \"permanent\" in the Internal Revenue Code because of the ever-shifting political winds."

Does this mean that C corporations are once again preferable to pass-through entities? The answer is . . . maybe or . . . it depends. The benefit of the 21 percent corporate income tax rate must be balanced against the additional tax cost of moving corporate earnings to the individual shareholder level. Because a C corporation is treated as a separate taxable entity, its profits are subject to tax when distributed as dividends or when the shareholders sell their stock for a gain. Gains from the sale of corporate stock and qualified dividends generally are taxed at preferential long-term capital gains rates rather than the higher ordinary income rates,[49] reducing but not eliminating the sting of the double tax regime. This advantage is partially offset for high-income taxpayers who are subject to the 3.8 percent tax on net investment income. After taking into account the 21 percent corporate rate and assuming a C corporation's after-tax earnings are distributed to individual shareholders as qualified dividends, the maximum combined federal rate is approximately 39.8 percent, down from 50.47 percent under the pre-2018 rates.[50]"

The shareholder-level tax on the $79,000 dividend is $18,802 which, when added to the $21,000 corporate tax, results in a combined tax of $39,802, or approximately 39.8 percent, without regard to possible additional state income taxes."

For example, owner-employees of a C corporation would distribute profits in the form of salary and fringe benefits that were tax-deductible by the corporation and, in the case of many fringe benefits, excludable by the owner-employee. Shareholders also loaned funds or leased property to a C corporation and withdrew earnings in the form of tax-deductible interest or rent. The viability of these strategies to mitigate the impact of the double tax must be reevaluated in light of the fact that the corporate income tax rate is so much lower than the highest individual rates, and compensation is taxable at the highest individual rates and also subject to employment taxes. C corporations in some lines of business can still reduce their tax liability by taking advantage of numerous corporate tax benefits, such as the ability to expense the cost of depreciable property (at least for the immediate future) and targeted tax benefits for manufacturing, research and development, and specialized industries. The most recent available data indicates that in 2013, nearly 49 percent of all C corporations filing returns reported no taxable income, and only 31 percent of C corporations had any corporate tax liability after tax credits were taken into account.[51]"

A second set of limitations limits the 20 percent deduction based on the taxpayer's share of \"W-2 wages\" paid to employees of the business and the unadjusted basis of certain depreciable property used in the business. In all cases, the deduction may not exceed 20 percent of the taxpayer's total income (determined without regard to the Section 199A deduction) reduced by net capital gain (generally, net long-term capital gain and qualified dividends)."

If otherwise feasible, the ideal tax plan would be to avoid paying dividends and reinvest the earnings in the corporation where they will be taxed at the preferential 21 percent rate until the business is sold or liquidated. An even better result for a closely held business with concentrated ownership would be to postpone any sales or liquidation until after the senior generation of owners dies. At that point, the basis of the decedent's stock will be stepped up to its fair market value as of the date of death,[55] and the stock can be sold at little or no tax cost.

When a pass-through tax regime is the desired alternative for a closely held business, the owners must choose among three legal forms: a partnership, a limited liability company, or an S corporation. The ownership and capital structure restrictions imposed on S corporations often require use of a partnership or LLC. S corporations are limited to 100 shareholders (although members of a \"family,\" broadly defined, are counted as one shareholder), and they may not have more than one class of stock.[61] Subchapter K is much more flexible than Subchapter S. To accommodate different types of owners, partnerships and LLCs may make special allocations of partnership income and deduction items, while shareholders of an S corporation must include corporate income and loss in proportion to their stock ownership.[62] Thus, partners may agree to share certain income or deductions disproportionately, and the agreement will be respected for tax purposes if it accurately reflects their economic business deal. In most cases, partnerships and LLCs (but not S corporations) also can distribute appreciated property in kind without immediate recognition of taxable gain. If an entity will hold appreciated property that it anticipates distributing to its owners at some point prior to a liquidation, a strong tax preference exists for structuring the activity through a Subchapter K entity rather than an S corporation."

Moreover, some tax advisors still recommend conducting a business as a state law corporation instead of a partnership or limited liability company because they (or their clients) are more comfortable with the corporate governance structure. Subchapter S provides those who prefer the corporate form with a relatively simple pass-through tax regime. As discussed below, S corporations also are often used by service providers to minimize their exposure to employment taxes."

Many institutional investors, such as tax-exempt pension funds and charitable organizations, are discouraged by the tax system from investing in any type of active business that is operated as a pass-through entity.[65] Venture capital funds, which provide a large source of capital for start-up companies, historically have been more comfortable using the familiar C corporation capitalized with several classes of stock, a structure not available in an S corporation.

Some tax advisors take the position that as long as the salary paid by the S corporation to a shareholder-employee is on the low end of a reasonable range, the Medicare tax can be avoided on that shareholder's remaining share of the S corporation's income even if it is the product of the shareholder's labor rather than a return on capital. In extreme cases, such as where little or no salary is paid and the S corporation simply distributes its net income to its sole owner, the Service likely will reclassify all or part of the distribution, or even the shareholder's pro rata share of undistributed corporate profits, as wages for employment tax purposes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this employment tax avoidance strategy is widely used by S corporations and often goes unchallenged.[71] Legislation to curtail this strategy has been considered but not yet enacted."

Unlike general partners, limited partners generally are not subject to self-employment tax on their distributive share of partnership income (apart from salary-like guaranteed payments), while the employment tax treatment of LLC members (who are classified as neither general nor limited partners under state law) is less certain.[72] The unsettled state of the law appeared to create an opportunity for tax avoidance by LLC members who are active in the business. In 1997, the Service issued proposed regulations to clarify these issues.[73] These regulations generally would have prevented partners and LLC members who provided more than 500 hours of service for their firms in a taxable year from taking advantage of the limited partner exclusion from self-employment tax. But after a storm of protest, Congress imposed a one-year moratorium[74] and, even though it expired, no final regulations had been adopted as of late 2019. In the meantime, the courts entered the fray. In an influential Tax Court decision, attorney-partners in a limited liability law firm partnership were not allowed to use the limited partner exclusion from self-employment"
