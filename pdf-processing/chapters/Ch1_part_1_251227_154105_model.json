Legal advisors to the earliest American corporations spent much of their time defining the relationship between the corporation and the state and developing hoary doctrines to regulate corporate governance and control. It was not until late in the 19th century that the genteel world of corporate law was jolted by the emergence of the income tax as a principal government revenue raising device. The life of the corporate lawyer would never be the same again. From the ill-fated Income Tax of 1894, which at the time was viewed as a Socialist plot because it imposed a two percent tax on individual and corporate net income,[1] to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909, which imposed a modest one percent tax on corporate net income over \\(5,000,[2] to the Sixteenth Amendment and beyond, the income tax gradually came to influence how corporations conducted their affairs. It is now well acknowledged, though often lamented, that taxes have invaded virtually every aspect of American business life. They shape and often twist management decisions and generally are an unpleasant distraction to those who would prefer to devote their full resources to the pursuit of profit."

Congress, having decided to treat the corporation as a separate taxpaying entity, went on to craft what has become known as a \"double tax regime.\"4 Under current law, a corporate tax is imposed annually, at the 21 percent flat rate set forth in Section 11, on the taxable income of a corporation. That income is taxed again if and when a corporation distributes dividends to its shareholders. Those dividends are not deductible by the distributing corporation but are taxed to its shareholders at rates that vary depending on whether the shareholder is an individual or a corporation, and they are not taxed at all to tax-exempt shareholders such as charities and retirement funds.5 Because the corporation is treated as a separate taxable entity, transactions between corporations and their shareholders are taxable events unless they qualify for nonrecognition treatment. The tax consequences of these transactions and other major changes and adjustments in a corporation are governed by Subchapter C (Sections 301 to 385) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a challenging and fascinating body of law that is the principal subject of this book. Corporations subject to the double tax regime also draw their identity (and monogram) from Subchapter C. Collectively, the Code refers to them as \"C corporations.\"6"

The outcome of this controversy will unfold as these and other transactions are studied later in this text. For now, it is sufficient to observe that the defenders of the corporate income tax largely prevailed on these questions in piecemeal legislation culminating with the Tax Reform of 1986. The results were a strengthened double tax regime, an increase in the tax costs of operating a profitable business as a C corporation, and greater pressure on techniques to reduce these costs."

And then, after many years of discussion, the 2016 election results opened the gates to the enactment in 2017 of legislation popularly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.[23] The 2017 Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and made numerous other changes that largely benefit business taxpayers.

Because nonresident aliens may not own stock in an S corporation, the investors' objectives could not be met using the corporate form. So they began lobbying state legislatures, and by the late 1970s Wyoming had enacted the first domestic limited liability company statute.[24] LLCs were not practically viable, however, until the Internal Revenue Service ruled, first privately and then in a 1989 published ruling, that a Wyoming LLC would be treated as a partnership rather than a corporation for tax purposes.[25]"

For much of our tax history, the policy decision to tax long-term capital gains at substantially lower rates than ordinary income influenced the tax planner's agenda.

A \"bailout\" was a distribution of earnings in a transaction, such as a redemption of stock, that qualifies as a \"sale or exchange,\" enabling the shareholder to recover all or part of her stock basis and to benefit from preferential capital gain treatment on any realized gain. In some cases, such as where the shareholder died and the basis of her stock was stepped up to its date-of-death value, the bailout could be accomplished tax-free.[28] Over the years, Congress responded with complex anti-bailout provisions to ensure that distributions resembling dividends would be taxed as ordinary income.[29]"

Transactions that qualify for nonrecognition treatment may go forward on a tax-free basis on the theory that they are mere changes in form resulting in a continuity of investment. To ensure that any realized gain or loss is merely deferred rather than eliminated, the typical nonrecognition provision includes corollary rules providing for transferred and exchanged bases and tacked holding periods.[30] A familiar example from basic income tax is a Section 1031 like-kind exchange.

The business profits of a foreign subsidiary generally are taxed only in the country where it operates and are not subject to additional U.S. tax until they are repatriated to the U.S. parent corporation. A principal goal of this structure has been to enjoy the significant benefit of tax deferral by keeping this overseas income offshore, either in cash or for future use in foreign operations. It is estimated that between \\(2 and \\)3 trillion of such profits were “locked out” of the U.S. sitting offshore.[34]"

Suppose a foreign corporation has a low effective tax rate and under its country's tax laws it is allowed to return overseas profits without additional tax. If that company wants to expand, a U.S. firm with overseas businesses may be an attractive partner. The foreign corporate suitor would look to (1) reduce the effective tax rate on the U.S. partner's future overseas business profits, and (2) repatriate the U.S. corporation's locked-out profits without additional tax. The point is that these strategies often made a U.S. company with foreign operations a more attractive acquisition target for a foreign corporation than a potential domestic suitor. Some highly publicized takeovers of U.S. firms by foreign corporations have involved Canadian companies, including ones in the pharmaceutical industry and the acquisition of Burger King by the Tim Horton chain. Canada generally does not tax overseas business profits, and it often allows repatriation of foreign profits without additional tax. While these acquisitions arguably had a business justification, it is also clear that tax advantages were sought to improve after-tax returns.[37] Although the IRS attempted to curb inversions by making the desired tax benefits more difficult to achieve,[38] resourceful tax advisors devised methods to circumvent these administrative obstacles."

One school of thought is that \"loopholes\" should be closed and legislation should be enacted to make it more difficult to reclassify U.S. entities or operations as \"foreign\" and escape the U.S. tax system. In the previous edition of this text, we noted that other suggested approaches included reducing corporate tax rates and ending the incentive for lock-out of foreign profits and predicted the possibility of legislation as part of a more comprehensive tax reform effort. The 2017 Act did not disappoint. In addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate, major changes were made to the taxation of foreign income earned by U.S. corporations by the adoption of a modified territorial system of taxation, the creation of a new tax subsidy for exports by U.S. corporations, and the imposition of a mandatory repatriation tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings.[39] A principal goal of the 2017 legislation was to rebalance the Code's tax incentives to encourage U.S. and foreign corporations to conduct more of their operations in the United States. Time will tell whether these changes successfully alter corporate behavior."

Is it because they enjoy limited liability under state law? Presumably not, because most LLCs are not subject to Subchapter C. Does the rise of the LLC undermine the policy underlying the double tax and threaten to destroy the corporate tax base? Would it make more sense to limit Subchapter C to large corporations (based on revenues) or publicly traded entities?

Where limited liability is essential, it can be achieved in a corporation, a limited liability company, or a limited partnership with a corporate general partner. In the many situations where state law provides flexibility to achieve these and other nontax goals, tax considerations often will influence the choice of entity decision. In evaluating the options, three critical questions are: (1) who will own the business and what type of economic relationship among them is contemplated; (2) how and when do the owners intend to realize a return on their investment (e.g., by making current distributions, or through a sale, public offering, or other exit strategy); and (3) is the business initially expected to generate losses and for how long?44 In making the decision, the threshold tax question is whether to use a C corporation or a pass-through entity and, if the latter, whether it should be a partnership, LLC or S corporation."

As enacted,this rate cut is said to be permanent in the sense that it will not automatically expire after a certain period of time but, of course, nothing is ever \"permanent\" in the Internal Revenue Code because of the ever-shifting political winds."

Does this mean that C corporations are once again preferable to pass-through entities? The answer is . . . maybe or . . . it depends. The benefit of the 21 percent corporate income tax rate must be balanced against the additional tax cost of moving corporate earnings to the individual shareholder level. Because a C corporation is treated as a separate taxable entity, its profits are subject to tax when distributed as dividends or when the shareholders sell their stock for a gain. Gains from the sale of corporate stock and qualified dividends generally are taxed at preferential long-term capital gains rates rather than the higher ordinary income rates,[49] reducing but not eliminating the sting of the double tax regime. This advantage is partially offset for high-income taxpayers who are subject to the 3.8 percent tax on net investment income. After taking into account the 21 percent corporate rate and assuming a C corporation's after-tax earnings are distributed to individual shareholders as qualified dividends, the maximum combined federal rate is approximately 39.8 percent, down from 50.47 percent under the pre-2018 rates.[50]"

For example, owner-employees of a C corporation would distribute profits in the form of salary and fringe benefits that were tax-deductible by the corporation and, in the case of many fringe benefits, excludable by the owner-employee. Shareholders also loaned funds or leased property to a C corporation and withdrew earnings in the form of tax-deductible interest or rent. The viability of these strategies to mitigate the impact of the double tax must be reevaluated in light of the fact that the corporate income tax rate is so much lower than the highest individual rates, and compensation is taxable at the highest individual rates and also subject to employment taxes. C corporations in some lines of business can still reduce their tax liability by taking advantage of numerous corporate tax benefits, such as the ability to expense the cost of depreciable property (at least for the immediate future) and targeted tax benefits for manufacturing, research and development, and specialized industries. The most recent available data indicates that in 2013, nearly 49 percent of all C corporations filing returns reported no taxable income, and only 31 percent of C corporations had any corporate tax liability after tax credits were taken into account.[51]"

When a pass-through tax regime is the desired alternative for a closely held business, the owners must choose among three legal forms: a partnership, a limited liability company, or an S corporation. The ownership and capital structure restrictions imposed on S corporations often require use of a partnership or LLC. S corporations are limited to 100 shareholders (although members of a \"family,\" broadly defined, are counted as one shareholder), and they may not have more than one class of stock.[61] Subchapter K is much more flexible than Subchapter S. To accommodate different types of owners, partnerships and LLCs may make special allocations of partnership income and deduction items, while shareholders of an S corporation must include corporate income and loss in proportion to their stock ownership.[62] Thus, partners may agree to share certain income or deductions disproportionately, and the agreement will be respected for tax purposes if it accurately reflects their economic business deal. In most cases, partnerships and LLCs (but not S corporations) also can distribute appreciated property in kind without immediate recognition of taxable gain. If an entity will hold appreciated property that it anticipates distributing to its owners at some point prior to a liquidation, a strong tax preference exists for structuring the activity through a Subchapter K entity rather than an S corporation."

In extreme cases, such as where little or no salary is paid and the S corporation simply distributes its net income to its sole owner, the Service likely will reclassify all or part of the distribution, or even the shareholder's pro rata share of undistributed corporate profits, as wages for employment tax purposes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this employment tax avoidance strategy is widely used by S corporations and often goes unchallenged.[71] Legislation to curtail this strategy has been considered but not yet enacted."

In 1997, the Service issued proposed regulations to clarify these issues.[73] These regulations generally would have prevented partners and LLC members who provided more than 500 hours of service for their firms in a taxable year from taking advantage of the limited partner exclusion from self-employment tax. But after a storm of protest, Congress imposed a one-year moratorium[74] and, even though it expired, no final regulations had been adopted as of late 2019. In the meantime, the courts entered the fray. In an influential Tax Court decision, attorney-partners in a limited liability law firm partnership were not allowed to use the limited partner exclusion from self-employment"
