PREFACE  The   publication   of the   Tenth   Edition   of Fundamentals   of Corporate  Taxation   marks   its   35th   anniversary.   During   much   of this   casebook’s  earlier   life, frequent   changes   to the tax law   contributed   to the reputation  of tax   textbooks   as   one   of the   world’s   most   perishable   commodities.   This became   clear   shortly   after   publication   of   the   First   Edition,   when enactment   of the   Tax   Reform   Act   of 1986   rearranged   the   tax   planning  agenda   for   C   corporations   and   their   shareholders.   Since   then,   we   have lived   through   frequent   individual   tax   rate   increases   and   reductions,  massive   regulations   projects,   tinkering   with   a   patchwork   quilt   of anti-  abuse   provisions,   an   assault   on   corporate   tax   shelters,   widening   of the  eligibility   gates   for   S   corporations,   and   emergence   of limited   liability  companies   as   the   entity   of choice   for many   closeiy   held   businesses.   The scope   and   complexity   of   all   these   developments   have   validated   our mission   way   back   when   to craft   a rich   mix   of materials   to help   students learn   the   “fundamentals”   of corporate   tax, which   has   long been   regarded as   one   of the   most   demanding   courses   in the law   school   curriculum.  In the   recent   past,   an   extended   period   of political   gridlock   and   much  talk   but   no   action   slowed   the   pace   of change.   This   rare   quiet   time   came  to   an   abrupt   end   in   late   2017   with   the   enactment   of major   legislation  known   as the Tax   Cuts   and Jobs Act. The   2017 Act left the basic structure  of Subchapters   C   and S   relatively   untouched.   But   it profoundly   altered  tax   planning   for   domestic   business   enterprises   with   its steep   reduction in   the   corporate   income   tax   rate   and   a   new   20   percent   deduction   for  certain   qualified   business   income   from   pass-through   entities.   This edition   incorporates   all   the   relevant   2017   Act   changes   and   other important   developments   affecting   corporations   and   shareholders.  Throughout all the   twists and turns in the tax   law,   our unwavering  goal has been to provide a teaching text, not a treatise, which is adaptable  to different levels   of coverage   and   always up-to-date. Our tradition in  introducing   each new edition is  to pause   and   remind ourselves and others of  the importance of teaching the “fundamentals” of corporate tax by the problem   method.   As we said in the Preface to the First Edition: *  * * [T]n our   collective experience,   we   have   been   troubled  by a common denominator in   the many fine corporate tax  casebooks   and texts: their sheer bulk.   In this book   and a  previously   published companion volume, Fundamentals of  Partnership   Taxation,   we   attempt to chart a different   course by ~ bringing the “fundamentals”   philosophy to the teaching of taxation of  the   business   enterprise. * *  * [T]he fundamentals approach involves   selectivity   of   subject   matter, emphasis on basic   concepts,   avoidance of esoteric   detail and realistic depth of coverage.   To   those   ends,   this volume is the   product of self- restraint—although   perhaps   not   enough.   At  times,   we   opted for  over   inclusion   to accommodate   the   varied   teaching   biases   and

--- Page 14 ---

vi   PREFACE  favorite   cases and topics of experienced instructors (including  ourselves). We have continued, however, to select and edit cases  with care. Lengthy citations, obscure   questions and meanderings into minutia   have   been avoided. Throughout the  book, we have made an effort to remember what it was like when  we studied corporate tax; this volume is designed as a teaching book, not the   definitive treatise. And so, of course, we expect  students to do  the reading! We   also   believe   that   the   most   effective   way   to   teach   and  learn   tax.   fundamentals   is by   the   problem   method.   This   book thus   contains   a comprehensive   yet manageable   set of problems to accompany   every   major   topic.   The   problems   are   designed   to  help students   decipher   the statute   and   apply it in a wide   variety  of   alternative   fact   situations.   Some   are   “building   block”  problems   with   specific   answers.   We   are   mindful,   however,   of the  tendency   to become   preoccupied   with   technical   trivia   and   have  also   included   some   more   sophisticated   (and   realistic)   problems  with   a planning   orientation.  The   primary   sources   in   any   tax   course   are   the   Code   and  Regulations.   But   the   statute   frequently   is unintelligible   when  read   out   of context.   To   provide   a foundation   of understanding,  this book   includes   extensive   explanatory   text   to accompany   the problems   and a   selection   of cases,   rulings,   legislative   history  and   other   materials.   The   goal   of   the   text   is   not   merely   to  paraphrase   the   Code.   In addition   to describing   the   workings   of  the   statute,   we   have   attempted   to explain   why   it works   the   way  it   does.   If   presented   as   a   purely   mechanical   exercise,   the  problem   method   can   degenerate   into   a   mindless   series   of  computations,   leaving   one   without   insights   into   the   function   of  the   statute,   the   relationship   between   sections   and   the   broad principles   governing   the   taxation   of   corporations   and shareholders.   By first explaining   the “why”   as well   as the “how,” we   hope   that   even   the   computational   problems   will   serve   as  launching   pads   for the   discussion   of more   important   policy   and planning   issues.  Turning to the   specifics   of organization   and coverage,   the Tenth  Edition   retains   the pedagogically   proven “cradle to grave”   organization. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to business   enterprise   taxation, offering perspective on   the   influential   policies   that have   shaped Subchapter   C  and   addressing the changed tax stakes after   the 2017 Act. It also surveys   the  corporate   income tax, introduces   relevant common law judicial   doctrines, and   highlights contemporary policy  issues. Chapters   2  and 3, which   examine   corporate   formations   and   capital  structure,   set   the   stage   for  a study   of Subchapter C’s double   tax regime and   the bias   in  favor   of  debt   that   historically   has   helped   taxpayers   avoid

--- Page 15 ---

ee Pee  its full impact. Chapter 3 illustrates how the   courts have   grappled with the distinction between debt and equity and evaluates the impact on debt financing of the lower   corporate income tax   rate and a new limitation on  the deduction of business interest added to the Code by the 2017 Act.  Chapters 4 through 6 cover operating distributions,   stock  redemptions, and stock dividends (including   Section 306 stock). For a  brief time after passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,   these chapters  lost much of their   vitality because ordinary income and capital gains  were taxed at the same rate. Then, as many predicted, a meaningful capital gains rate preference   was restored, breathing new life into these  operational   chapters and validating our decision to retain textual  discussion and problems even when the stakes were low. When Congress decided to tax qualified dividends and   long-term capital gains at the  same reduced rates, it was “deja vu all over again.” The historical agenda was to avoid dividend treatment and “bail out” corporate earnings at  capital gains rates. But since 2008, the only significant advantage of a capital gains bailout is recovery of   basis. Continuing to hedge, this  edition   retains some traditional materials just in case Congress decides to lead us back to earlier times. It  is up to instructors to decide how much emphasis to give to characterization issues in view of the diminished  stakes in corporate-shareholder distribution   transactions.  Complete   liquidations   and   taxable   acquisitions   are   addressed   in  Chapters   7   and   8.   The   materials   on   taxable   stock   acquisitions   offer  selective   coverage   of   Section   338   without   getting   bogged   down   in   too much   arcane   minutia.   Chapters   9 through   12 cover   the still vibrant   topics  of tax-free   reorganizations   and   corporate   divisions,   including   the   rules  and   limitations   affecting   carryovers   of corporate   tax   attributes.   These  materials   incorporate   recent   regulations   projects   on   a   variety   of topics and   legislation   designed   to curb   the use   of tax-free   corporate   divisions   for  certain   types   of   transactions   that   are   more   appropriately   treated   as  taxable   sales.  Chapter   13   is a survey   of affiliated   corporations.   Many   instructors will not   have   time   to cover   this   material.   For   those   who   wish   students   to achieve   literacy,   not   mastery,   this   chapter   offers   a primer   on   the   Code’s limitations   on   using   multiple   corporations   for tax   avoidance,   Section   482  allocations,   and   consolidated   groups.  Chapter 14, which is devoted to anti-abuse provisions,   begins   with a section   on   codification   of  the economic   substance doctrine, including a short problem. Some instructors may prefer to assign this   topic   earlier, and it  is designed as a self-standing   overview for those who do. The remainder of   the chapter   examines the accumulated   earnings   and personal   holding company taxes.   For   an extended   period   prior to 2018,  the   relative   parity between the   corporate   and   individual   rates   on  ordinary   income,   and   the   taxation   of  most   dividends at lower   capital gains   rates,   reduced   the  role of  these   anti-avoidance   provisions   almost to

viii   PREFACE  the vanishing point. The lower   corporate income tax  rate has restored the  incentive for some C corporations to accumulate rather than distribute  earnings and, as a result, the penalty taxes are   no longer a historical  relic.  Part   Three   (Chapter   15)   is devoted   to   S corporations,   which   are   a  popular   alternative   for   businesses   (most   with   only   one   or   two shareholders)   whose   structure   can   accommodate   to   a   simpler   pass-  through   taxing   regime.   This   chapter   provides   an   efficient   explanation   of the   workings   of   Subchapter   S,   including   an   overview   of   when   S  corporation   shareholders   can   take   advantage   of   the   new   20   percent  deduction   for   qualified   business   income.   It   also   describes   how   S  corporations   are   used   to   lessen   the   impact   of   employment   taxes   on  shareholders   who   perform   services   for the   business   while   also   avoiding  the   net   investment   income   tax   imposed   on   high-income   taxpayers. Similar   chapters   on   Subchapter   S are   included   in our   companion   volume, Fundamentals   of   Partnership   Taxation,   and   in   Fundamentals   of  Business   Enterprise   Taxation,   an   alternative   text   for   a combined   course  on   corporate   and   partnership   tax.   Tax   professors   continue   to   debate whether   S corporations   are   best   covered   in   corporate   tax,   a   course   on pass-through   entities,   or a combined   business   enterprise   taxation   course offering.   Our   books   accommodate   any   of these   approaches. Turning   to matters   of style, we   assume   that the text will be assigned  with   the   most   recent   edition   of the   Code   and   Regulations.   Suggested  assignments   to   these   sources   are   provided   for   each   topic.   Instructors  should   review   these   assignments   carefully,   editing   when   necessary   to  ensure   that   they   are   consistent   with   the   desired   level   of   coverage.  Deletions   from   cases   and   other   authorities   have   been   made   freely,   with  asterisks   used   to denote   substantive   omissions,   but citations   and   internal  cross   references   in   excerpted   materials   have   been   deleted   without   so  indicating.   Editorial   additions   are   in brackets.   Footnotes   to the   author’s  text   and   notes   are   numbered   consecutively   within   each   chapter   (and   not  within   each   section   of a chapter,   as in earlier   editions).   Footnotes   in cases  and   other   original   sources   have   not   been   changed,   but   many   footnotes  have   been   deleted   from   these   materials   without   renumbering   those   that  remain.   The   text   is current   through   July   1, 2019. The   authors   extend special thanks to Professor Bruce McGovern for  his constructive   suggestions   and   invaluable   assistance in updating several chapters on a much earlier   edition when he  was an LL.M student at the University of Florida   College of Law. We remain   indebted to many  former   students who assisted   on   prior editions,   particularly: Ted   Brooks, Mitch   Salamon,   Ray   Kawasaki, Terri Murray,   Jim Potratz,   Jeff Anthony, Garo   Kalfayan,   Steve   Vogelsang, Julie   Divola,   Joe   Bartlett, Marilyn Cleveland,   Chris   Detzel,   and   Jeffrey   Essner.  We also thank   Steve   Lind   and   Josh   Rosenberg for  their   contributions to   the   early   development of this   text   and   are   grateful   for   the   research

CHAPTER   1  AN   OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS  AND SHAREHOLDERS  A. INTRODUCTION TO TAXATION OF BUSINESS ENTITIES  Since   the   time   when   the   British   Crown   begrudgingly   recognized  collective   profit-seeking   enterprises,   the   artificial   legal   entity   known   as  the   “corporation”   has   served   as   a   principal   vehicle   for   conducting  business   in a capitalist   economic   system.   Legal   advisors   to the   earliest  American   corporations   spent   much   of their time   defining   the relationship between   the   corporation   and   the   state   and   developing   hoary   doctrines   to regulate   corporate   governance   and   control.   It was   not   until   late   in the 19th   century   that   the   genteel   world   of corporate   law   was   jolted   by   the emergence   of the   income   tax   as   a principal   government   revenue   raising  device.   The   life of the   corporate   lawyer   would   never   be   the   same   again.  From   the   ili-fated   Income   Tax   of 1894,   which   at the   time   was   viewed   as  a   Socialist   plot because   it imposed   a   two   percent   tax   on   individual   and  corporate   net   income,!   to   the   Payne-Aldrich   Tariff   Act   of   1909,   which  imposed   a modest   one   percent   tax   on   corporate   net   income   over   $5,000,? to the   Sixteenth   Amendment   and   beyond,   the income   tax   gradually   came to   influence   how   corporations   conducted   their   affairs.   It   is   now   well  acknowledged,   though   often   lamented,   that   taxes   have   invaded   virtually  every   aspect   of American   business   life.   They   shape   and   often   twist  management   decisions   and   generally   are   an   unpleasant   distraction   to those   who   would   prefer   to   devote   their   full   resources   to   the   pursuit   of  profit.  The   decision   to   superimpose   an   income   tax   on   a   system   that  recognized   artificial   entities   as   separate   from   their   owners   raised   a  fundamental   structural   question.   The   dilemma   confronting   the  architects   of the   federal   income   tax   was   whether   to treat   corporations,  partnerships,   trusts   and   other   vehicles   for   conducting   business   as separate   taxable   entities   or as   an   aggregate   of the underlying   owners. Since   the   earliest   federal   income   tax   acts,   a   corporation   has   been  treated   as   a   distinct   taxable   entity,   separate   and   apart   from   its shareholders.   Once   that   policy   decision   was   made,   a   host   of additional questions   followed.   What   rates   should   be   applied   to   corporate   income?  1 See   Bittker &   Lokken,   Federal   Taxation of Income,   Estates   and Gifts   {| 1.1.2;   see   also  Pollock v. Farmers’   Loan   &  Trust Co.,   157   U.S.   429,   15 S.Ct.   673   (1895). 2 See   Bittker   &   Eustice,   Federal   Income   Taxation   of  Corporations   and   Shareholders  4 1.01.

INTRODUCTION   PART 1  Should   they resemble   the   graduated   rates   applicable   to individuals   or is a   flat   rate   more   appropriate?   How   should   the   tax   system   treat transactions   between   a corporation   and its shareholders?   If a corporation already   has   been   taxed   on   its earnings,   should   those   earnings   be taxed again   when   they   are   distributed   to   the   shareholders?   If   so,   is   it  appropriate   to   give   the   corporation   a   deduction   for   the   amount   of the  distribution?   In short,   must   corporate   income   be taxed   twice—once   when  earned   by   the   corporation   and   again,   after   distribution   to   the  shareholders?  The   answers   will   unfold   throughout   this   text.   But   it   serves   no purpose   to hide   the   ball   on   the   most   fundamental   question.   Congress,  having   decided   to   treat   the   corporation   as   a   separate   taxpaying   entity,  went   on to craft what   has become   known   as a “double   tax   regime.”4 Under  current   law,   a corporate   tax   is imposed   aliniatiy rAdThee eve tee   flat  rate   set forth   in Section   11, on   the taxable   income   of a corporation.   That income   is taxed   again   if and   when   a corporation   distributes   dividends   to its shareholders.   Those   dividends   are   not   deductible   by the   distributing corporation   but are taxed   to its shareholders   at rates   that vary   depending on   whether   the   shareholder   is an   individual   or   a corporation,   and   they are   not   taxed   at   all   to   tax-exempt   shareholders   such   as   charities   and  retirement   funds.5   Because   the   corporation   is   treated   as   a   separate  taxable   entity,   transactions   between   corporations   and   their   shareholders are   taxable   events   unless   they qualify   for nonrecognition   treatment.   The tax   consequences   of these   transactions   and   other   major   changes   and  adjustments   in a corporation   are   governed   by Subchapter   C (Sections   301  to   385)   of   the   Internal   Revenue   Code   of   1986,   a   challenging   and fascinating   body   of   law   that   is   the   principal   subject   of   this   book. Corporations   subject   to the   double   tax   regime   also   draw   their   identity  (and monogram)   from   Subchapter   C. Collectively,   the Code   refers   to them  as   “C corporations.”6 Congress made a markedly different   policy   decision in the case   of partnerships   and limited liability companies,   which are treated by Subchapter K of the Code as pass-through entities that  do  not pay federal  income tax. Instead,   partners?   include their distributive shares of  partnership   income,   deductions, losses and other   items when  determining their tax liability. A  partner’s   share of partnership losses for  3 See, e.g., McLure,   Must Corporate   Income   Be   Taxed   Twice? (1979). 4 The   term   “double” is somewhat misleading insofar as   it suggests that corporations are taxed at the same rate twice or over-taxed. “Two-layer tax” may be a more accurate   description,  but the crisper “double tax” has become ingrained in the   tax  lexicon.  5 Since 20038, most   dividends   received by   noncorporate   shareholders are taxed at the  same preferential  rates as long-term capital   gains.   I.R.C. § 1(h)(11). For  corporate   shareholders some relief from a potential triple  tax is provided   by a 50, 65 or 100   percent   dividends   received  deduction   under   Section   243. See   Section D1 of  this chapter, infra. Tax-exempt   shareholders  are generally   not   taxed   on dividends   they receive.  6 LR.C. § 1361(a)(2).  " References to “partners”   are intended to include members of   limited   liability  companies.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  a taxable year are deductible only to the extent of the partner’s basis in her partnership interest. These losses also may be   subject to other timing limitations.? Ongoing adjustments to the   basis of a partner’s interest in the partnership ensure that income and losses are not taxed  (or deducted) twice.19  Partnerships are treated as entities, however, for purposes of  selecting a taxable year, computing and characterizing   partnership  income, filing information returns, making elections, undergoing audits  by the Internal Revenue Service and in several substantive contexts,  such as formation   and termination,   transactions between partners and  partnerships, and sales of partnership interests.11 This mixture of  aggregate   and entity approaches contributes to substantial complexity and tax avoidance opportunities.  The   double   tax   regime   generally   applicable   to corporations   and   the pass-through   system   governing   partnerships   and   limited   liability  companies   represent   the   Code’s   two   fundamental   alternatives   for taxing  business   enterprises.   To level the playing   field and   respond   to the special problems   of unique   industries,   Congress   occasionally   has   enacted   other  business   tax   regimes.   For   example,   to minimize   the   role   of taxes   on   the  choice   of form   for   closely   held   businesses,   some   corporations   may   elect under   Subchapter S to be treated   as   pass-through   entities   if they   satisfy a   strict   set   of   eligibility   requirements.!2   Corporations   making   that  election   are   known   as   “S corporations.”  While   the   tax   treatment   of   S   corporations   and   partnerships   is similar,   the   two   systems   are   not   identical.   In   general,   Subchapter   K offers   partners   greater   flexibility   in   determining   their   tax   results.   For example,   partnerships   have   greater   freedom   to make   special   allocations of income   and losses,   and partners   may   include   their share   of partnership liabilities   in the   basis   of their   partnership   interest.   S corporations   may not   make   special   allocations   and   S   corporation   shareholders,   unlike partners,   may   not   include   their   pro   rata   share   of the   firm’s   liabilities   in  the basis   of their   stock.13  To   preclude   widely   held   businesses   from   disincorporating   to escape the   double   tax   regime   of   Subchapter   C,   most   of   the   relatively   few partnerships   that   are   publicly   traded   are   treated   as   corporations   for tax purposes.!4   Other   types   of   hybrid   entities   qualify   for   pass-through treatment   if they   satisfy   requirements   designed   to   limit   the   nature   of  8   T[.R.C.   §§ 701;   704(d). ~   9   TZR.C.   §§ 461(2);   465; 469. 10   =T.R.C.   § 705.  1 =[LR.C. §§  721;   707;   741.

The   Code   imposes no   limit   on   the   value   of an S  corporation,   but eligibility   for Subchapter   S status is restricted to corporations   having not more   than   100  shareholders or more   than   one   class   of  stock.

1 INTRODUCTION   os  their   business   operations,5   and   corporations   in   certain   discrete industries   are   governed   by specialized   taxing   regimes,   which   are   beyond the scope   this text.16   Despite   these   departures   from   the norm,   the central question   remains—shall   business   profits be subjected   to one   or two levels of tax?   The   debate   on   this   question   continues   to   rage   and   will   arise  repeatedly   throughout   the text.  B.   INFLUENTIAL   POLICIES  For   many   years,   the   policies   underlying   Subchapter   C have   been   in a   state   of   disequilibrium   as   Congress   periodically   tinkers   with   the  Internal   Revenue   Code   as   part   of   a   highly   politicized   tax   legislative process.   The   interrelationship   of   these   policies   influences   taxpayer behavior   regarding   the   type   of entity   in   which   to   conduct   a   business  enterprise,   capital   structure   and   financing   of   corporate   activities,  dividend   and compensation   policy,   estate   planning,   and   a myriad   of other tax and business   planning   decisions.   An   overview   of the past   and   current  synergy   of these   influential   policies,   as well   as a peek   at the impact   of the  global   economy   on   the   shape   and   reach   of   the   corporate   tax,   are appropriate   before   moving   on.  The Double Tax. The concept at the heart of Subchapter C is the double   taxation of corporate   income. In many situations,   the double tax is more theoretical than real. Corporations   have   been   adept at  minimizing their   tax liability by taking advantage of  self-help strategies and  by utilizing numerous tax preferences scattered throughout the Code to provide an incentive for various activities. Studies based on securities  law filings have   reported that some large and profitable   publicly traded corporations   pay little or no U.S. tax,17 and many major   shareholders,  such as wealthy charities and qualified retirement funds,   do   not pay  taxes on   the dividends   they receive. The decision to treat corporations as separate   taxable entities, distinct from their shareholders, is controversial.18 Some of the debate is  about the incidence of the corporate tax—whether it is borne by shareholders,   employees,   corporate managers,   consumers of the  company’s goods and services, or investors in general.!9 Critics   also point  6 See e.g., Subchapter   M,  governing   regulated investment   companies   (mutual funds) and  real estate investment trusts.  16 See, e.g., Subchapter   L (Insurance Companies),   Subchapter H (banks   and trust  companies),   and Subchapter   F  (tax-exempt   organizations   and cooperatives).  17 See, e.g., Institute on Taxation   and   Economic Policy, “Corporate   Tax  Avoidance Remain Rampant Under   New Tax   Law” (reporting   that  60 profitable Fortune 500 companies avoided all  federal income tax  in 2018). But see Richard   Rubin,   “Does Amazon Really Pay  No   Taxes? Here’s the Complicated   Answer,”   Wall St. J ournal, June 14, 2019 (noting  that the  studies are  not based  on actual   corporate tax   returns, which are   private, and that   financial statements are an  imperfect   snapshot of a corporation’s   true   overall   tax burden).  18 See   generally   Shaviro, Decoding the   U.S. Corporate   Tax (2009). 19 See, e.g., Harberger,   “The   Incidence of  the Corporation   Income Tax,”   70 J.  Pol. Econ.  215  (1962); Klein,  “The  Incidence of  the  Corporation   Income   Tax: A  Lawyer’s   View of  a Problem  in Economics,   65   Wisc.L.   Rev.   576   (1965). Many economists   have   given   up   on   this   question,  concluding   that   they   are unable to ascertain   who   bears   the   burden of  the   corporate tax. See

AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS  to the adverse impact of the tax on the   allocation of economic resources;  its complexity; the disadvantages it places on U.S. companies in the  global economy; and many other evils, including three distinct   biases: (1)  against   corporate as opposed to noncorporate   investment (because only  corporate capital is subject to a second tax); (2) in favor of debt financing  for businesses   organized as C corporations because corporations can deduct the   interest they   pay on debt (subject to   a general limitation  beginning in 201829) but not dividends to holders of equity capital; and (3) in favor of retention of earnings at the corporate level as opposed to  distribution of dividends.?! If a double   tax is accepted   as the appropriate   corporate   taxing   model, the   discussion   then   turns   to the “integrity”   of the corporate-level   tax.   For  example,   should   the   corporate   income   tax   apply   not   only   to   operating profits   but   also   to   distributions   of   appreciated   property   and   sales   in connection   with   corporate   liquidations?   The   outcome   of this   controversy  will unfold   as   these   and   other   transactions   are   studied   later   in this text. For   now,   it is sufficient   to   observe   that   the   defenders   of the   corporate  income   tax   largely   prevailed   on   these   questions   in piecemeal   legislation culminating   with   the   Tax   Reform   of   1986.   The   results   were   a strengthened   double   tax regime,   an   increase   in the tax   costs   of operating  a   profitable   business   as   a   C   corporation,   and   greater   pressure   on techniques   to reduce   these   costs.  More   recently,   however,   the   pendulum   began   swinging   in the   other direction,   initially   with   the   reduction   in   2003   of   the   tax   rates   on dividends.22   The   proliferation   of   various   business   tax   incentives   to  stimulate   economic   growth   also   softened   the   impact   of the   corporate income   tax   for   those   industries   targeted   for   tax   relief.   And   then,   after  many   years   of discussion,   the   2016   election   results   opened   the   gates   to  the   enactment   in   2017   of legislation   popularly   known   as   the   Tax   Cuts and   Jobs   Act.23   The   2017   Act reduced   the corporate   tax rate to 21 percent  and   made   numerous   other   changes   that   largely   benefit   business  taxpayers.   Its   implications   on   taxpayer   behavior   will   be   addressed throughout   this chapter. The   desire   to   avoid   the   double   tax   on   corporate   profits   while obtaining   limited   liability   for   all   the   owners   of a   business   fueled   the  generally   Break,   “The   Incidence   and   Economic   Effects   of Taxation,”   in The   Economics   of Public  Finance   (Brookings   1974).  20   See   I.R.C.   § 163G),   discussed   in Chapter   3A2,   supra.  21 See   generally American   Law Institute, Federal Income   Tax Project Subchapter   C 341—  355 (1982). Commentators also point to the “compensating biases” in the  individual income tax,  such as the   rate   structure,   preferential   capital   gains rates, and the ability   of individuals to  obtain a stepped-up basis  in appreciated   property   acquired   from a decedent.   See Zolt, “Corporate Tax After   the Tax   Reform Act of  1986: A State   of Disequilibrium,”   66  N.C.L.   Rev.   839   (1988). 22 Most   dividends   received by noncorporate   shareholders are taxed at  the same 15 or 20 percent rate   as long-term   capital   gains.   I.R.C. § 1(h)(11)(A).   See   Chapter   4A2, infra. 23 Pub.   L.   No.   115-97,   formally titled “An   Act to provide for reconciliation   pursuant to titles   II and   V of  the   concurrent   resolution   of  the  budget for fiscal year   2018.”   This   legislation  will  be referred   to throughout   this text   as   the  Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs   Act  or  “the   2017   Act.”

8   _INrropucTioN.  growth   of new   legal   forms,   such   as   the   limited   liability   company.   The  origins   of the   LLC   in the   United   States   can   be   traced   to the search   by  foreign   investors   in the   oil and   gas   industry   for   a   U.S.   business   entity that   would   combine   limited   liability   protection   for   all owners   with   one level   of taxation.   Because   nonresident   aliens   may   not   own   stock   in an   S  corporation,   the investors’   objectives   could   not be met   using the corporate  form.   So   they   began   lobbying   state   legislatures,   and   by the   late   1970s Wyoming   had   enacted   the   first   domestic   limited   liability   company statute.24   LLCs   were   not   practically   viable,   however,   until   the   Internal  Revenue   Service   ruled,   first   privately   and   then   in   a   1989   published  ruling,   that   a Wyoming   LLC   would   be   treated   as   a   partnership   rather  than   a corporation   for tax   purposes.?5  These   and   other   developments   reduced   the   contribution   of   the corporate   income   tax   to total   federal   revenue   collections.   In   the   1950s, corporate   taxes   amounted   to 25 to 30 percent   of total   revenues   collected, but   they   dropped   to   roughly   14   percent   in   the   1970s   and   have   fallen further   since   2000.26   The   Congressional   Budget   Office’s   most   recently  available   projections   for   the   decade   beginning   in   2019   are   that   the  corporate   income   tax   will   raise   about   8 percent   of total   federal   receipts  and   constitute   1.4 percent   of gross   domestic   product,   both   sharp   declines  from   the previous   50-year   average.27 Preferential   Capital   Gains   Rates.   For   much   of our   tax   history,   the  policy decision   to tax long-term   capital   gains   at substantially   lower   rates  than   ordinary   income   influenced   the   tax   planner’s   agenda.   Rather   than  paying   dividends,   tax   advisors   devised   techniques   to “bail   out”   earnings at   capital   gains   rates.   A   “bailout”   was   a   distribution   of earnings   in   a  transaction,   such   as   a   redemption   of stock,   that   qualifies   as   a   “sale   or exchange,”   enabling   the   shareholder   to   recover   all or   part   of her   stock  basis   and   to   benefit   from   preferential   capital   gain   treatment   on   any  realized   gain.   In some   cases,   such   as where   the   shareholder   died   and   the  basis   of her   stock   was   stepped   up   to its date-of-death   value,   the   bailout could   be   accomplished   tax-free.28   Over   the   years,   Congress   responded  with   complex   anti-bailout   provisions   to   ensure   that   distributions  resembling   dividends   would   be taxed   as   ordinary   income.29 Since   2003,   with   most   dividends   and   long-term capital gains   taxed at the same preferential rates, the  traditional   incentive for a bailout has  24 See Hamill,   “The Limited Liability Company:   A Catalyst Exposing   The   Corporate  Integration  Question,” 95 Mich.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS   9  just about   disappeared. Under the current rate structure, the tax goal of  a bailout would not be to convert dividend income to capital gain but  rather to enable shareholders to recover all or part of the   basis in their stock. Only if capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate than dividends, as could happen if Congress   changes its mind again in the future, would a bailout reassume its role as a strategy to reduce the double tax on C  corporations and their shareholders   and make some of the topics covered in this course much more compelling.  Nonrecognition. Under the realization principle, gains and losses are not taxable until they are realized in a sale, exchange or other event that makes the gain or loss “real” and   more easily measurable.   The  nonrecognition concept assumes that   certain   realization events should not be impeded by the imposition of a tax. Transactions that   qualify for  nonrecognition   treatment may go forward on a tax-free   basis on the theory that they are mere   changes in form resulting in a continuity of investment. To   ensure that any realized gain or loss is merely deferred  rather than eliminated, the   typical nonrecognition provision   includes  corollary rules providing for transferred and exchanged bases and tacked  holding periods.?° A familiar example from basic income tax is  a Section  1031 like-kind exchange.   The   nonrecognition principle pervades  Subchapter C, affecting transactions ranging   from the simple   corporate formation to complex mergers and acquisitions.  The   opportunity   to   qualify   a   corporate   transaction   for  nonrecognition   assumed   even   greater   importance   when   Congress enacted   legislation   to   require   corporations   to   recognize   gain   on   most distributions   of   appreciated   property   and   sales   pursuant   to   a   plan   of complete   liquidation.3!   Standing   in   sharp   contrast   are   acquisitions  known   as   tax-free   reorganizations,   which   ordinarily   are   free of tax to all the parties,   albeit   with   the trade-off of transferred   bases   and   a carryover of other   tax   attributes.   Taxpayers   thus   may   be encouraged   to structure  sales   of a corporate   business   to come   within   an   applicable   nonrecognition  provision   in order   to   avoid   (or at   least   defer)   tax   at   the   corporate   and shareholder   levels. The   International Dimension.   The taxation of multinational  companies, while of great importance in a global economy, is beyond the  scope of coverage of this   text, which is confined to domestic   taxation of  corporations   and   shareholders. It  is sufficient here to make a few   general  observations to illustrate how multinational   corporations   have  contributed to the  erosion of  the  corporate   income tax base   and why they  influenced the   debate over comprehensive business tax   reform.  30 See,   eg., LR.C. § 1031, which   provides for nonrecognition on   certain   like-kind exchanges.  81 See   Chapter   7B2, infra. Certain   taxable   acquisitions of stock   will continue to trigger  only shareholder-level   gain but the  bases   of  the  acquired   corporation’s   assets   will  transfer   to  the  purchaser.

10  INTRODUCTION   PART 1  The principal tax distinctions   that have driven much of the tax  planning   by U.S. multinational corporations are the   tax rates and  jurisdiction rules in the U.S. tax system. According to the Organization  for Economic Cooperation   and Development,?2 prior to 2018, when the  top statutory corporate income tax  rate was 35 percent, the United States had a combined federal and state corporate tax rate  of  39.1 percent, while the average OECD rate was 24.1 percent.33 Many   non-OECD countries have even   lower rates. Additionally, the   U.S.   historically has   taxed its  domestic corporations on   their worldwide   income with a limited tax credit for foreign income taxes paid, while many developed countries tax  their corporations only on income   earned   from sources within the country. Under the “territorial” system of many foreign   countries, income earned   abroad   from an   active business   generally   bears no additional tax  when it is repatriated to the home country. In response   to these   tax   rules,   many   U.S.   companies   structure   their  overseas   operations   through   foreign   subsidiaries.   The   business   profits   of  a   foreign   subsidiary   generally   are   taxed   only   in   the   country   where   it operates   and   are   not   subject   to   additional   U.S.   tax   until   they   are  repatriated   to   the   U.S.   parent   corporation.   A   principal   goal   of   this structure   has   been   to   enjoy   the   significant   benefit   of tax   deferral   by  keeping   this   overseas   income   offshore,   either   in cash   or for future   use   in  foreign operations.   It is estimated   that between   $2 and   $3 trillion   of such  profits   were   “locked   out”   of the   U.S.   sitting   offshore.34 It also has   been   common   practice   for the foreign   subsidiaries   of U.S.  companies   to engage   in transactions   to shift income   to more   lightly taxed  jurisdictions,   including   tax   havens   with   no   income   tax.   Examples   are  sales,   leases,   loans,   and   licenses   of   intellectual   property   with   other  foreign   affiliates   of the   U.S.   parent.   Technology   companies   reportedly have   exploited   this   opportunity   with   great   success   by   situating   their intangible   property   (e.g.,   patents   and   software)   abroad   and   paying royalties   to   foreign   subsidiaries   in   no   or   low-tax   countries   where   the  company   conducts   little or no business   activity.   It has   been   reported   that  Google   Inc. employed   these   strategies   to reduce   the tax rate   on its foreign  profits   to below   3 percent.%5 Another tax-saving   strategy is the corporate   “inversion,” where a  U.S. company merges with, or   is acquired by, what usually is  a smaller  foreign company and   moves its tax residence   outside of the   U.S.36 A  corporate   inversion, in part, is about   seeking to improve the   tax   results  %2 The OKCD is  a forum   where the governments of  34  countries committed to democracy and   market   economies   work together   and   with less developed countries to promote   economic  growth   and prosperity, and   sustain development.  33 See  http://taxfoundation.org/blog/us-has-highest-corporate-income-tax-rate-oecd.  *4 See _http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03 04/ i   i 2-1-trillion-overseas-to-avoid-taxes Bilal Yate Fp  8   See _ http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10   21/  aN -10-21/google-2-4-rate-   -how-  60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes. ap ea ae aa  36 See generally   http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/tax-inversion.

- AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS HAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS  of U.S. firms with foreign   operations. Suppose a foreign corporation   has  a low effective tax rate and under its country’s tax laws it is allowed to  return   overseas profits without additional tax.   If that company wants to  expand, a U.S.   firm with   overseas businesses may be an attractive partner. The foreign corporate suitor would look to (1) reduce the  effective tax rate   on the   U.S. partner’s   future overseas   business profits,  and (2) repatriate the   U.S. corporation’s   locked-out profits without  additional tax. The point is that these   strategies often made a U.S.  company with foreign operations a more attractive acquisition target for  a foreign corporation   than a potential domestic suitor. Some highly publicized takeovers of U.S. firms by foreign corporations have involved  Canadian companies, including ones in the pharmaceutical industry and the acquisition of Burger   King   by the Tim Horton chain. Canada  generally does not   tax overseas   business profits, and it often allows  repatriation of foreign profits without additional tax. While these acquisitions arguably   had a business justification, it is also  clear that tax advantages were   sought to improve after-tax   returns.37 Although the IRS attempted to curb   inversions by making the desired tax benefits more  difficult to achieve,38 resourceful tax advisors   devised methods to  circumvent these administrative obstacles. Publicity   regarding   the overseas   tax rates   of U.S.   multinationals   and the   wave   of corporate   inversions   fueled   a   robust   debate   regarding   the U.S.’s   tax rules for international   operations.   One   school   of thought   is that “loopholes”   should   be closed   and   legislation   should   be enacted   to make   it  more   difficult   to   reclassify   U.S.   entities   or   operations   as   “foreign”   and  escape   the   U.S.   tax   system.   In the previous   edition   of this text, we   noted  that   other   suggested   approaches   included   reducing   corporate   tax   rates and   ending   the   incentive   for lock-out   of foreign   profits   and   predicted   the  possibility   of legislation   as   part   of   a more   comprehensive   tax   reform  effort.   The   2017   Act   did   not   disappoint.   In   addition   to   reducing   the  corporate   income   tax   rate,   major   changes   were   made   to the   taxation   of  foreign   income   earned   by U.S.   corporations   by the   adoption   of a modified  territorial   system   of   taxation,   the   creation   of   a   new   tax   subsidy   for exports   by   U.S.   corporations,   and   the   imposition   of   a   mandatory  repatriation   tax   on   previously   untaxed   foreign   earnings.%®   A   principal  goal of the   2017   legislation   was   to rebalance   the   Code’s   tax incentives   to  encourage   U.S.   and   foreign   corporations   to   conduct   more   of   their  operations   in the   United   States.   Time   will   tell   whether   these   changes  successfully   alter   corporate   behavior.  ~ The   Broader   Business   Enterprise   Tax Policy   Debate. The explosive  growth of  the LLC as  a “best of all worlds” legal form   and the diminished role   of  the   corporate   income tax have   breathed   new life into   the broader  37 See   http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2014/08/25/burger-kings-tax-inversion-and-  canadas-favorable-corporate-tax-rates/#4a97f1d9205a.  38 See, e.g., Notice   2015-79,   2015-49 I.R.B.   775;   Notice   2014-52,   2014-42,   2014-42 L.R.B.  712; T.D.   9761,   81 Fed.

Consider   the   following   questions,  which   focus   on fundamental   structural   issues   that were   not addressed   in  the   2017   Act.   Why   does   the   Internal   Revenue   Code   have   two   separate pass-through   tax   regimes   for   closely   held   business   enterprises,   one (Subchapter   K) for partnerships   and   LLCs   and   the   other   (Subchapter   S)  for certain   corporations,   each   with   different   qualification   standards   and  operative   provisions??°   If a   single   pass-through   regime   were   adopted, would   Subchapter   K   be   preferable   to   Subchapter   S,   or   would   some  combination   of the   two   be   the   best   approach?4!   Why   are   C corporations  singled   out   for   a   double   tax   regime?   Is   it because   they   enjoy   limited liability   under   state   law?   Presumably   not,   because   most   LLCs   are   not subject   to Subchapter   C. Does   the   rise   of the   LLC   undermine   the   policy underlying   the double   tax and threaten   to destroy the corporate   tax base? Would   it make   more   sense   to limit   Subchapter   C   to   large   corporations  (based   on   revenues)   or   publicly   traded   entities?   Or   should   there   be   a  single   one-tier   tax   regime   for all business   income   without   regard   to the organizational   form?42   And   how   would   U.S.   multinational   corporations  be taxed   under   a revised   regime?  This   is enough   food for thought   at this early juncture.   The   remaining chapters   revisit   most   of these   issues   in greater   depth.   A closer   look   at the ongoing   policy   debate   and   a snapshot   of options   for reform   are   provided at the end   of this chapter.  The next   section   pivots from policy to practice by providing an  introductory overview of the   choice of business entity universe.   In  deciding how their new business will be taxed,   the founders are presented  with   three   options: (1) the pass-through tax treatment offered to  partnerships   and limited liability companies   by   Subchapter K; (2)  taxation of a corporation as   a separate entity under Subchapter C, with a second level  of  tax if and when earnings are distributed to shareholders or the business is sold; or (8) the pass-through   treatment offered to corporations by Subchapter S. Choosing among these   options   requires a multifaceted cost/benefit analysis that is sensitive to changes in the   tax law and, most recently, was   profoundly affected by the Tax   Cuts   and Jobs  Act.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS CHAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS 13  of the particular business may drive   the decision. For example, if public  trading of ownership interests is desired, a C corporation almost always  is the   entity of choice.43 Access to venture capital   investors, a preference  for executive compensation techniques such as stock   options, or an exit  strategy that anticipates a public offering or merger with a public company all usually dictate   use of the corporate form. For closely held firms, however, the nontax objectives of the parties can   be adequately satisfied in a variety of  legal forms. Where limited  liability is essential, it can be achieved in a corporation, a limited   hability company, or   a limited partnership with a corporate   general partner. In the many situations where state law   provides flexibility to achieve these  and other nontax goals,   tax considerations often will influence the choice of entity decision.   In evaluating the   options, three critical questions are:  (1) who will own the business and what type of economic relationship  among them is contemplated; (2) how and when do the owners intend to realize a return on   their investment (eg., by making current distributions, or through a sale, public offering, or other exit strategy);  and (8) is the business initially expected to generate losses and for how  long?44   In making the decision,   the threshold tax question is whether to  use a C corporation or  a pass-through entity and, if the latter, whether it  should be a partnership, LLC or S corporation. The   choice   of entity stakes   and   strategies   have   changed   dramatically as   the   federal   tax   system   has   experienced   a   sustained   period   of instability   since   the   mid-1980s.   The   discussion   that   follows   provides   an overview   of   the   most   significant   tax   considerations   in   making   the decision,   looking   back   briefly   at tax   history   to place   the   current   state   of affairs   into   proper   perspective. Individual   Income   Tax   Rates.   Because   C corporations   are   subject   to  a   double   tax   regime   while   partnerships,   LLCs   and S   corporations   are  only   taxed   at   the   owner   level,   the   relationship   between   the   individual  and   entity-level   tax   rates   is an   important   factor   in evaluating   whether   a privately   held   business   should   choose   to be taxed   as   a C corporation   or a  pass-through   entity.   -  During the many years since publication of the First Edition of this text, tax   rates   on ordinary   income   and capital gains for individual  taxpayers   have   been in a continuing state   of flux against the backdrop of an ongoing political debate over   federal   tax   policy. Currently, the   top  marginal   ordinary   income tax   rate   on “high-income”   individuals is 37 percent, down slightly from the   39.6 percent rate   in  effect from   2013 to  43 Except in  a few   specialized   industries,   such as natural   resources,   virtually all publicly traded   partnerships are   classified   as corporations for  tax   purposes.   As a  result,   there is rarely  any   tax  incentive to  use   that   legal  form   instead   of a corporation.   See LR.C.   §  7704   and   Section  E2b of  this  chapter, infra. 44 See generally   Bagley   &  Dauchy,   The   Entrepreneur's   Guide to Law   and   Strategy   70-73  (6th ed. 2018).

14  INTRODUCTION   PART 1  2017.45 Rates of  zero and 15 percent   apply to most   long-term capital gains and qualified dividends,   but the   top marginal rate for these tax-favored items   increases to 20 percent for the highest income taxpayers.*® There  also is a 28 percent rate for gain on the sale of  collectibles and a 25 percent rate for unrecaptured Section 1250 gain. In   addition,   a   3.8   percent   tax   is imposed   on   the   lesser   of (1)   net investment   income,   or   (2)   modified   adjusted   gross   income,   which   is essentially   adjusted   gross   income   over   a   threshold   amount   of $250,000  for a joint return   or   surviving   spouse,   $125,000   for a married   individual filing   separately,   or   $200,000   for   all other   taxpayers.47   Net   investment  income   is   broadly   defined   to   include   interest,   dividends,   annuities,  royalties,   rents   (other than   from   an   active   trade   or business),   and   capital  gains,   less   deductions   allocable   to   those   items.   Net   investment   income also   includes   passive   income   (within   the   meaning   of the   Section   469 passive   loss rules) from   trade   or business   activities   in which   the taxpayer  does   not   materially   participate   and   income   from   the   type   of   active  securities   and   commodities   trading   often   conducted   by   hedge   funds.48  The   effect of this additional   tax on high-income   taxpayers   is to raise their nominal   federal   income   tax   rate   on   qualified   dividend   income   and   long-  term   capital   gains   to 23.8   percent.  Tax Rates for C Corporations and the Double   Tax   Regime. Several aspects of the   tax law   inform the analysis of whether conducting a  business through a C corporation is preferable to the pass-through tax  regimes offered to partnerships, LLCs,   and   S corporations: (1) the  relationship between corporate and individual income tax rates; (2) the individual tax   rate applicable to dividend income   and sales   of corporate  stock; (3) how easily   the two-tax regime that nominally applies to earnings of a C corporation can be mitigated or avoided; and (4) whether  and to what extent   the owners of businesses   operated as pass-through entities   are   eligible to deduct 20. percent of   their share of certain “qualified business   income”   under Section   199A. In  the   distant past, there was a strong   preference for conducting an  operating   business through a C corporation   because the corporate income  tax rates were   considerably   lower   than the individual rates. Throughout  the late 1960s   and the   entire   1970s,   individual income tax   rates topped  out at 70 percent   while   top corporate tax   rates peaked at just below 50 percent.   In this   era, C corporations offered a refuge   from the robustly progressive income tax   rate   structure.   This discrepancy flipped temporarily   following   passage of   the Tax   Reform Act of 1986, which  reduced the maximum individual income tax rate to 28  percent   while   the  4 For   2019,   the   37   percent rate applies to taxable income of $519,301 or more for single taxpayers   and   $612,351 or more for married filing  jointly taxpayers.   The   individual   rates   are  indexed   annually for  inflation. The   individual rate reductions in  the 2017   Act are scheduled to expire at the  end of 2025   unless   they are extended or made   permanent.  46 See   generally I.R.C. § 1(h).  ee   RiGagm   ate  48 LRC.   § 1411(6)(1), (2).

AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS 15  top  corporate rate remained higher at 34   percent. But the 28 percent  individual rate lasted only three   years before it started creeping   back up.  From the   early 1990s through 2017, the   top marginal individual income tax rate generally was either slightly higher   than or the same as the  top  corporate rate.  The end result during this period preceding the 2017 Act was a slight rate preference for earnings taxed at the corporate level, especially for the small amount of income taxed at the then   lower marginal corporate  rates on the first $75,000 of taxable income. But in many situations,   the  modest rate advantage for C corporations   was outweighed by the fact  that pass-through entities are subject to only one level of tax. These relationships   were radically   altered by the 2017 Act, where Congress  rejected eliminating the double tax regime applicable to C corporations  and instead moderated its bite by lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent—a 40 percent   decrease   from the   top 35 percent rate that  had been in place for many years. As enacted, this rate   cut is said to be  permanent in the   sense   that it will not automatically expire after a  certain period of time but,   of course, nothing is ever “permanent” in the Internal Revenue Code   because of the ever-shifting political winds. At   least   for   the   immediate   future,   the   corporate   rate   is   now significantly   lower   than   the   highest   individual   marginal   rate.   Does   this  mean   that   C   corporations   are   once   again   preferable   to   pass-through  entities?   The   answer   is...   maybe   or...   it depends.   The   benefit   of the 21  percent   corporate   income   tax   rate   must   be   balanced   against   the additional   tax   cost   of   moving   corporate   earnings   to   the   individual  shareholder   level.   Because   a   C   corporation   is   treated   as   a   separate taxable   entity,   its profits are   subject to tax when   distributed   as dividends or when   the   shareholders   sell their   stock   for a gain.   Gains   from   the   sale of   corporate   stock   and   qualified   dividends   generally   are   taxed   at preferential   long-term   capital   gains   rates   rather   than   the   higher ordinary   income   rates,49   reducing   but   not   eliminating   the   sting   of the double   tax   regime.   This   advantage   is partially   offset   for   high-income  taxpayers   who   are   subject   to   the   3.8   percent   tax   on   net   investment income.   After   taking   into   account   the   21   percent   corporate   rate   and  assuming   a   C   corporation’s   after-tax   earnings   are   distributed   to  individual   shareholders   as   qualified   dividends,   the   maximum   combined  federal   rate   is   approximately   39.8   percent,   down   from   50.47   percent under   the   pre-2018   rates.5°  49   TR   Cay tia) (1):  50 The 39.8 percent combined rate   can   be   explained   with   the   following   example. A   C corporation   with   $100,000 of  net income   taxable at the 21  percent  flat rate would   pay   $21,000  of corporate tax, leaving   $79,000 for distribution as   a dividend to its sole shareholder   who is  taxed at  the   highest   marginal rate   of  23.8   percent   (taking into account the   3.8 percent   tax on  net investment   income).   The   shareholder-level   tax   on   the   $79,000   dividend is $18,802   which,  when   added to  the  $21,000   corporate tax,  results   in  a combined tax of  $39,802, or approximately  39.8   percent,   without   regard to  possible   additional   state   income   taxes.

16  INTRODUCTION   PART 1  Historically, not all earnings generated by C corporations   were subject to the nominal two-tier tax regime. For example, owner- employees of a C corporation would distribute profits  in the form of salary and fringe benefits   that were   tax-deductible by the corporation and, in the case   of many fringe benefits, excludable by the owner-employee. Shareholders also loaned   funds or leased property to a C corporation and withdrew earnings in the form of tax-deductible interest or rent. The viability of these   strategies to mitigate the impact of the double tax must be reevaluated in light  of the fact that   the corporate income tax rate is  so  much lower than the highest   individual rates, and compensation is  taxable at the highest individual rates and also subject to employment  taxes. C corporations in some lines of business can still reduce their   tax  liability by taking advantage of numerous corporate tax  benefits, such as  the ability to expense the cost of depreciable property (at least for the  immediate future) and targeted tax benefits for manufacturing, research  and   development,   and specialized   industries. The   most recent   available  data   indicates   that in 2013, nearly 49 percent of all C corporations filing  returns reported no taxable income, and only 31 percent of C corporations  had any  corporate tax liability after tax  credits were   taken into account.®1 In   situations   where   the   historic   self-help   strategies   remain   viable and   effective,   the   Service   has   weapons   to   combat   them.   Payments   of salary   or   interest   can   be   reclassified   as   disguised   dividends.   Congress  also has   enacted   penalty   taxes   to patrol   against   excessive   accumulations or   avoidance   of the   individual   progressive   rates.52   With   foresight   and good   planning,   however,   an   active   business   that   pays   reasonable compensation   and justifies   any   accumulations   of earnings   on   the basis   of  reasonable   business   judgment   is able to avoid   constructive   dividends   and  the   corporate   penalty   taxes   with   relative   ease.  Avoidance of Gain on Sale of Small Business Stock. An additional  tax incentive to choose a C corporation for a new business   seeking long-  term value over current   distribution of earnings is the exclusion of all  or part of the gain on the sale  of qualified small business stock provided by Section 1202. If certain   detailed requirements are met, and   they often will be for the   early   investors in a start-up   venture,   individual  shareholders can exclude some or   all of the   capital gain on   the sale   of  stock   held for more   than five years.  The New Deduction for 20  Percent   of Qualified   Business   Income   from Pass-Through Entities. To level the playing field between   now lightly  taxed C corporations   and   business entities   that   pass through their  income to owners subject to higher   individual rates, Congress   added a  numbingly   complex   new   provision   allowing   noncorporate   taxpayers to deduct   20   percent of their share of  “qualified   business   income”   (“QBI’)  ae Ee  51 Statistics   of Income—2013,   Returns of Active   Corporations, Other than F  1120-REIT,  and  1120-RIC,  Table  2. j Y (oedaedicnene:  “S 2   See   LR.C.   § 531 et seq.

Z AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS HAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS  from   businesses conducted as partnerships, LLCs, S corporations, and sole proprietorships. The business income of taxpayers who qualify for the full deduction is effectively taxed at a top marginal rate   of 29.6  percent instead of 37 percent (29.6 percent is 37 percent   multiplied by  the  80 percent of taxable qualified business income after the deduction).53 This represents a 25 percent   reduction from the pre-2018 top rate   of 39.6  percent. This is much less than the corporate rate reduction but  considerably more than the small rate cut for wage earners.  Very generally, QBI is the net income passing through to the  taxpayer from an active trade or business conducted by a pass-through  entity, whether or not the taxpayer actively participates in the management of the business. In all cases, wages paid to employees are  excluded   from   QBI. Amounts paid (or that should have   been paid) by an S corporation to an owner-employee as reasonable compensation or by a  partnership or LLC as   a “guaranteed payment” and traditional forms of  investment income, such as interest, dividends and capital   gains, also do  not qualify for the deduction.  The   20   percent   deduction,   however,   is   subject   to   a   nasty   web   of special   rules   and   limitations,   mostly   aimed   at   high-income   taxpayers.  For   individuals   whose   taxable   income   exceeds   certain   thresholds,   the  deduction   is   not   available   for   income   derived   from   certain   specified  service   businesses.   This   disfavored   category   adversely   affects   doctors,  lawyers,   accountants,   entertainers,   consultants,   investment   advisors,  and   athletes   (among   others),   but   not   engineers   or architects.   The   service  business   limitation   does   not   apply   to taxpayers   below   the taxable   income thresholds   and   is phased   in gradually   for those   above   them.   A second   set of limitations   limits   the   20   percent   deduction   based   on   the   taxpayer’s share   of   “W-2   wages”   paid   to   employees   of   the   business   and   the unadjusted   basis   of certain   depreciable   property   used   in the business.   In  all cases,   the   deduction   may   not   exceed   20 percent   of the taxpayer’s   total  income   (determined   without   regard   to   the   Section   199A   deduction)  reduced   by   net   capital   gain   (generally,   net   long-term   capital   gain   and  qualified   dividends).  For   now   (it’s still early),   all these   details,   and   others   not   included   in  this   preview,   are   less   important   than   simply   being   aware   that   the   new  Section   199A   deduction   must   be   added   to   the   list   of   factors   to   be  considered   in making   the   choice-of-entity   decision.   In many   cases   it may tip the   scales   in favor   of choosing   a pass-through   entity.*4 The   Bottom Line. A major   takeaway from the 2017   Act is that some ‘profitable   closely  held   businesses that   previously   chose to operate as  sole  proprietorships or pass-through entities to avoid   the   double tax may  want to reconsider   using   C  corporations   because of  the   lower   corporate tax   rate. As in   the   good old   days,   corporations   once   again   may be   “an 53 For many   taxpayers   who qualify for  the full 20   percent   deduction,   the   “effective”   tax  rate   on   their   share   of qualified   business   income will  be much   lower   than   29.6   percent. 54 Section   199A is covered   in detail   in  Chapter   15D2,   infra.  17

18 INTRODUCTION   PART 1  attractive refuge”   but  only when strategies   can be employed to minimize, defer or, where possible, completely avoid a second layer of  tax at the  shareholder level. If otherwise feasible, the ideal tax plan would be to  avoid paying dividends and reinvest the earnings in the corporation where they will be taxed at the preferential 21 percent rate   until the  business is sold or liquidated. An even better result for a closely held  business with concentrated ownership   would be to postpone any sales or  liquidation until   after the senior generation of owners dies. At that point,  the basis of the decedent’s stock will be stepped up to its fair market value  as of the date of death,®® and the   stock   can be sold at little or no tax cost.  For   individual shareholders, the opportunity to exclude all  or part of the gain on the sale of qualified small business stock also may be an influential factor   in choosing a C corporation. On the other hand,   for profitable   companies   that regularly   distribute a   significant   portion   of   their   earnings,   the   use   of   a   C   corporation continues   to come   at a high tax cost   despite   the corporate   rate   reduction. For   those   businesses,   and   for   funds   investing   in   securities   and   real  estate,   pass-through   entities   are   usually   the   more   tax   efficient   choice,  especially   when   the 20 percent   deduction   under   Section   199A   is available  to lower   the   maximum   effective   tax   rate   to 29.6   percent.  Pass-Through   of Losses.   Investors   who   anticipate   losses   in the   early  years   of a new   venture   desire   to deduct   them   against   income   from   other sources   as   quickly   as   possible.   A   pass-through   tax   regime   permits   the owners   who   devote   their time   and   energy   to the business   (..e., “materially participate”)   to   deduct   their   losses   currently,   but   the   ability   of passive  investors   to   deduct   those   losses   is often   delayed   by   an   array   of   Code  provisions   designed   to curtail   tax   shelters   at the   individual   level.56   The 2017   Act   also   added   a   new   limitation   on   deductions   of certain   excess  business   losses   for   noncorporate   taxpayers,57   which   in   some   cases   will  defer   any   tax   benefits   from   losses   even   for owners   who   are   active   in the  business. A C corporation is not   able to pass through start-up losses to its  shareholders,   but   corporations may deduct losses against their taxable income   and carry any excess forward indefinitely as net operating losses  when they may reduce   up to 80 percent of   the corporation’s   taxable income.58   For   start-up companies that   raise   capital from outside investors,   these tax   rules are among the   factors   that may weigh in favor  of a C corporation. Although the   start-up   losses   do   not   pass through as  they are   realized, most   taxable   investors would be unable to deduct them currently in any   event   because of  the   passive activity   loss limitations, and   nontaxable investors,   such as pension   funds   and charities,   are  Meee OEE Sr ieee   eo 6   LR.C. § 1014,  6   See, e.g., ILR.C. §§  465;   469;   704(d);   13866(d).  57 L.R.C. § 461(J). 58 See   LR.C.   § 172.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS 19  indifferent.59 In many typical start-up scenarios, the losses may be used  more efficiently as carryforwards to shelter income earned   during the  early  years of a C corporation’s profitability.6° But if a new company has owners active in the business and expects initially to generate losses, a pass-through entity is most often  the entity of choice to enable the owners to deduct the losses against their income from other   sources and do so  sooner   rather than later.  Subchapter K v. Subchapter S. When a pass-through tax regime is  the desired   alternative for a closely held   business, the owners   must choose among three legal forms: a partnership, a limited liability  company, or an S corporation. The ownership and capital structure  restrictions imposed on S corporations often require use of a partnership  or LLC. S corporations are limited to 100 shareholders (although members of a “family,” broadly defined, are counted as one shareholder),  and they may not have   more than one class   of  stock.6! Subchapter K is  much more flexible than Subchapter S. To accommodate different types  of owners, partnerships   and LLCs   may   make special   allocations of  partnership   income and   deduction items, while shareholders of an S corporation must include corporate income and loss in proportion to their stock ownership.®?   Thus,   partners may agree to share certain income or deductions disproportionately, and the agreement will be respected for  tax purposes if it accurately reflects   their economic business deal. In most  cases, partnerships   and LLCs (but  not S corporations) also can   distribute  appreciated   property in kind without immediate recognition of taxable gain. If an   entity will hold appreciated   property that it anticipates  distributing to its owners at some point prior to a liquidation, a strong  tax preference exists for structuring the activity through a Subchapter K entity rather than an S corporation.  Unlike   S corporation   shareholders,   partners   may   increase   the   basis  of   their   partnership   interests   by   their   allocable   share   of   entity-level  debts.63   That   additional   “basis   credit”   may   be important   for maximizing  the   ability   to deduct   losses   realized   by the   enterprise—e.g.,   in ventures  that   own   leveraged   real   estate—or   avoiding   gain   on   distributions.®   For  these   and   other   reasons,   the   conventional   wisdom   is that   Subchapter   K is   more   taxpayer-friendly   than   Subchapter   S.   In   fact,   much   of   the  59   For   a venture   capital   fund   that invests   in a diversified   portfolio   of start-up   businesses, however,   forming   each   business   as   a   C   corporation   prevents   the   fund   from   using   losses   from start-ups   that fail against   the gains   generated   by those   that succeed.   The   willingness   of venture  capital funds   to forgo these   deductions   has been   criticized   by some   commentators.   See Fleischer, “The   Rational   Exuberance   of Structuring   Venture   Capital   Start-Ups,”   57 Tax L. Rev.   137 (2003); ~Johnson, “Why Do   Venture Capital Funds   Burn   Research   and Development Deductions?,”   29  Va. Tax Rev.   29 (2009); Bankman, “The   Structure of Silicon Valley  Start-ups,”   42 UCLA L. Rev.  1737 (1994).  60 In some cases, however, the   use   of  loss carryovers   by a C corporation may be   limited after  a significant change of ownership.

20 INTRODUCTION   PART 1  popularity of LLCs is attributable to the fact that they offer limited liability to all investors combined with the more flexible partnership tax  regime.  In   some   situations,   however,   the   goals   of business   owners   may   be  better   achieved   with   an   S corporation,   such   as where   there   are   only a few owners   (maybe   just   one)   and   the   flexibility   of   Subchapter   K   is   not  necessary.   Moreover,   some   tax   advisors   still   recommend   conducting   a  business   as   a   state   law   corporation   instead   of a partnership   or   limited liability   company   because   they   (or their   clients)   are   more   comfortable  with   the   corporate   governance   structure.   Subchapter   S   provides   those who   prefer   the   corporate   form   with   a relatively   simple   pass-through   tax  regime.   As   discussed   below,   S corporations   also   are   often   used   by service  providers   to minimize   their   exposure   to employment   taxes. On   the   other   hand,   S corporations   are   not   a viable   choice   in   many  situations—for   example,   a business   with   foreign   investors,   who   are   not permissible   S   corporation   shareholders.   Many   institutional   investors,  such   as   tax-exempt   pension   funds   and   charitable   organizations,   are  discouraged   by   the   tax   system   from   investing   in   any   type   of   active business   that   is   operated   as   a   pass-through   entity.65   Venture   capital  funds,   which   provide   a   large   source   of capital   for   start-up   companies,  historically   have   been   more   comfortable   using   the familiar   C corporation  capitalized   with   several   classes   of stock,   a structure   not   available   in an S corporation.   These   are just a few illustrations   of the types   of additional factors   influencing   the choice   of entity   decision. State Tax Issues. State tax considerations also may play a role in  deciding the   best form of pass-through entity. For example, in some states LLCs are subject to entity-level   taxes   that are not imposed on partnerships,   and   S corporations may be taxed adversely compared to partnerships.  Employment Tax   Considerations. Where a principal owner is also a  service provider, employment taxes   can be an   influential   factor   in  choosing the legal form for the business. Employment taxes are imposed  in addition to income taxes   on employee   wages§7   and on   net earnings from   self-employment.®8 A self-employed individual, such as a sole  proprietor or   a general   partner who derives income   from a trade or  business   conducted   by a partnership in which he is  a partner, must   pay  is Stripped of  detail, pension   funds   and other tax-exempt organizations are potentially subject to the “unrelated   business   income tax”   on income   passing   through   from an operating  business   conducted as   a partnership or S corporation,   but   they are generally not taxable on income   from “portfolio” investments,   such as dividends   and interest   received   from an equity or  debt  interest   in a C corporation.   See   generally I.R.C. §§ 511 et  seq. <8 See generally Ely, Grissom   & Thistle, “An   Update on   the   State Tax   Treatment of oan Liability Companies and   Limited Liability Partnerships,”   87 State Tax   Notes   155   (Jan.  87 One-half   the employment tax   on wages is paid   by the employee   through   withholding  and   the other   half is paid  by the   employer,   which   may   deduct   the tax   as a business   expense.

The   Medicare tax rate increases to 3.8  percent for taxpayers with self-employment income above certain high-  income thresholds.7°  S corporations, especially   those with only one shareholder, are often used by service providers to avoid the uncapped Medicare portion of self-  employment taxes. Some tax advisors   take the   position that as long as  the salary   paid by the S corporation to a shareholder-employee is on the low end of a reasonable range, the Medicare tax can be avoided on that  shareholder’s remaining share of the S corporation’s income even if  it is  the product of the shareholder’s labor rather than a return on   capital. In  extreme cases, such as where little or no salary is paid and the S  corporation   simply distributes its net income to its sole owner, the  Service likely will reclassify all  or part of the   distribution, or even the shareholder’s pro   rata share of undistributed corporate profits, as wages for employment tax purposes. Anecdotal evidence   suggests that this employment tax avoidance strategy is widely   used by S corporations and often   goes unchallenged.7! Legislation to curtail this strategy has been  considered but not   yet enacted.  Employment   taxes   also   may   influence   the   choice   between   a limited  partnership   and   an   LLC.   Unlike   general   partners,   limited   partners  generally   are   not   subject   to   self-employment   tax   on   their   distributive share   of   partnership   income   (apart   from   salary-like   guaranteed  payments),   while   the   employment   tax   treatment   of LLC   members   (who are   classified   as   neither   genera!   nor   limited   partners   under   state   law)   is  less   certain.72   The   unsettled   state   of   the   law   appeared   to   create   an  opportunity   for   tax   avoidance   by   LLC   members   who   are   active   in the  business.   In 1997,   the Service   issued   proposed   regulations   to clarify these  issues.73   These   regulations   generally   would   have   prevented   partners   and LLC   members   who   provided   more   than   500   hours   of service   for   their firms   in   a   taxable   year   from   taking   advantage   of the   limited   partner exclusion   from   self-employment   tax.   But   after   a   storm   of   protest, Congress   imposed   a one-year   moratorium”   and,   even   though   it expired, no   final   regulations   had   been   adopted   as   of late   2019.   In the   meantime, the   courts   entered   the   fray.   In   an   influential   Tax   Court   decision,  attorney-partners   in   a   limited   liability   law   firm   partnership   were   not  allowed   to   use   the   limited   partner   exclusion   from   self-employment  69 TR.C. § 1402(a).

T1 INTRODUCTION   PAE  taxes.75 This holding is consistent with the functional approach taken by  the 1997 proposed regulations and   undercuts the aggressive position   that  LLC   members qualify for the   “limited partner”   exclusion from : self-  employment tax even if they are active service providers to   a business with nominal capital.76 To   sum   up   all this   information,   the   employment   tax   regime   is not applied   uniformly   to   service   providers   who   are   partners,   members   of  LLCs   and   LLPs,   and   S corporation   shareholders,   and   in some   respects  the law   is not   crystal clear.   This   inconsistency   and   uncertainty   appear   to  have   fueled   the   growth   of one-person   S corporations   in order   to avoid   the  full impact   of employment   taxes.  Existing   Entities:   Change   of Form.   If an   existing   entity   wants   to  change   its   legal   form   or   tax   status,   it   may   confront   significant   tax  impediments.   For   example,   converting   a C corporation   to a partnership or   LLC   will   require   the   corporation   to   liquidate,   which   may   trigger  significant   corporate   and   shareholder   tax   liability.77   Alternatively,   a   C  corporation   may   make   an   election   to become   an S   corporation   with   no  immediate   tax   consequences,   but   asset   appreciation   and   other   income  accruing   prior   to the   conversion   still may   be subject   to a corporate-level  tax   when   those   gains   are   ultimately   realized.78   Incorporating   a partnership   or LLC,   and converting   a partnership   into an   LLC   or an   LLP, generally   may   be accomplished   without   adverse   tax   consequences. Choice   of  Entity   Trends. The choice of entity landscape continues to evolve, and   some interesting   trends were   developing prior to the 2017  Act. Contrary to predictions of  their demise, S corporations have shown  surprising vitality. In  1997, for the first time, a majority of corporate tax  returns   were filed by   S corporations,79 and the popularity of S corporations   has continued to increase.   In 2018, the most recent   year for  which data is available, S corporations accounted for 71 percent of the  roughly 7.2 million corporate   returns filed.80  The number of businesses filing partnership returns also has grown considerably,   increasing at an average   annual rate   of 2.5 percent   from  2006 through 2016.81   In   addition,   the mix of   entities within the  partnership tax universe   has changed dramatically. The number of LLCs  has   steadily increased over   the   past   20 years. LLCs   outnumber limited  partnerships   by   more   than 5:1, and   beginning in 2002,   the number of  75  Renkemeyer,   Campbell   & Weaver, LLP y. Commissioner, 136 T.C. 137 (2011).

e AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS  HAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS 23  LLCs surpassed general and limited partnerships   combined.®2 In 2016, LLCs represented almost 70 percent of all partnership returns, as  compared to 11 percent for limited partnerships.83 This   data suggests that   the growth of LLCs has come to some degree at the expense of  entities that previously would have   been formed as general or limited  partnerships.  Perspective. For those who are still conscious after digesting all this information on the first day of class, it should be apparent that a thoughtful choice of entity decision requires a good grounding in the  fundamentals of individual and business enterprise   taxation and the  ability to do a nuanced cost/benefit   analysis. Not to worry—that study  has just begun. When it ends, the many issues and options confronting  the founders of a new business, which may seem quite intimidating at  this point, will come into sharper focus.  D.   THE   CORPORATION   AS   A TAXABLE   ENTITY 1.   THE   CORPORATE   INCOME   TAX  Code:   §§ 11(a),   (b)(1)   &   (2); 63(a).   Skim   §§ 1201(a);   1211(a);   1212(a)(1).  Students   are   often   surprised   to   learn   that   a   study   of   corporate  taxation   devotes   very   little   time   to the   determination   of a corporation’s tax   liability.   The   reason   is   that   the   concepts   used   in   making   that determination   already   should   have   been   mastered   in the   basic   federal income   tax   course.   Those   same   broad   principles—gross   income, deductions,   assignment   of income,   timing   and   characterization—apply   in computing   the   taxable   income   of a   C   corporation,   and   we   only   need   to  pause   briefly   to discuss   the   rate   structure   and   a few   other   special   rules  applicable   to C corporations.  Rates.   A   C   corporation,   like   an   individual,   is   a   separate   taxable  entity   for   federal   income   tax   purposes.   The   corporation   selects   its   own  taxable   year   and   method   of accounting,   computes   its   taxable   income under   applicable   principles   of the   tax   law   and   otherwise   is   generally  treated   like   any   other   taxable   person.   The   corporate   rate   is found   in Section   11, which   for many   years   provided   a limited   number   of brackets  for lower   income   corporations   ranging   from   15 to 34 percent   and   became  an   essentially   35 percent   flat rate tax for the most   profitable   companies.*4 The   Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs   Act   reduced   the corporate   tax rate   to 21 percent. Determination of   Taxable   Income.   Section   63(a)   defines   taxable income as “gross income   minus the deductions   allowed   by this chapter.”  In   the   case   of a corporation, this amount generally is determined   by  applying   the same principles   and   Code sections   applicable to individuals.  82 Wheeler   &  Shumofsky,   Partnership   Returns,   2005,   27 SOI Bulletin   69  (2007).  8   See   IRS Statistics   of Income,   Partnership   Returns,   2016,   Partnership   One   Sheet, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5338.pdf. 84   TRC.   § 11(b)   (pre-2018).

24 INTRODUCTION   PART 1  A few differences, primarily attributable to the distinct status of the corporation as an artificial business entity, are worth mentioning.  First,   a   corporation   has   no   “personal”   expenses,   and,   unlike   an  individual,   it   is   not   required   to   choose   between   taking   itemized deductions   or   the   standard   deduction.   Corporations   thus   are   not concerned   with   distinguishing   between   “above-the-line”   deductions  allowable   in   reaching   adjusted   gross   income   and   “below-the-line” itemized   deductions.  In   addition,   many   deductions   allowed   to   individuals   are   not  available   to corporations.   For   example,   a corporation   is not   entitled   to a  medical   expense   deduction   under   Section   213.   Moreover,   Section   212,  which   allows   a deduction   for certain   expenses   incurred   for the production  of income   or maintenance   of income-producing   property   or for tax   advice,  is expressly   applicable   only to individuals.8>   Corporations   need   not worry  however,   because   virtually   all of their   ordinary   expenses   in the   pursuit of profit   are   deductible   as   ordinary   and   necessary   business   expenses  under   Section   162.  On   the   other   hand,   certain   limitations   on   the   deductibility   of  personal   expenses   of   individuals   do   not   apply   to   corporations.   For example,   Section   165(c),   which   limits   the   deductibility   of nonbusiness  losses,   Section   166(d),   which   characterizes   nonbusiness   bad   debts   as  short-term   capital   losses,   and   Section   183(a),   which   limits   deductions   for  activities   not   motivated   by   profit,   are   among   a   number   of restrictive sections   that do not apply to C corporations.   This   is because   it is generally assumed   that all of a corporation’s   activities   are   motivated   by the pursuit of   profit.86   Corporations   also   are   not   subject   to   the   $10,000   cap   on deduction   of state   and   local taxes. By virtue of their unique status, corporations are entitled to one important   deduction not available to individuals. To   prevent   multiple taxation as earnings wend their way   through a chain of corporations, corporate shareholders   generally are entitled to deduct 50 percent (or, in some cases, 65 or 100   percent) of the dividends   they receive from other corporations. The effect of the   50 percent   dividends   received deduction is  that corporations are subject to tax at a maximum rate   of 10.5 percent on dividends—an   amount derived by  applying the   21 percent   corporate rate  to the   50 percent   includable   portion of  the   dividends.  _The   remaining differences in the treatment of corporations   and individuals are the   result   of a conscious legislative   choice to treat them differently. For example, the percentage limitation   on corporate  a SRE   eee  *° For tax  years beginning in 2018   and   continuing   through 2025,   Section   212   deductions  that for noncorporate   taxpayers are   also miscellaneous   itemized   deductions   subject to the  two  percent of adjusted gross income limitation are   no longer   deductible.   LR.C. § 67(g). 86 Certain   payments   made   by a corporation to   or on behalf   of its shareholders   may be  nondeductible   because   they are   in   fact dividends,   but   their disallowance is the   result   of  the classification   of  the payments as constructive   dividends   rath p   ‘ s er than  the “personal  payments.

Corporations   may   deduct   capital   losses   only   to the   extent  of capital   gains   during   the taxable   year.   Although   the   excess   may   not be applied   against   ordinary   income,   it may   be carried   back   for three   years and   carried   forward   for five years.   By contrast,   individuals   are   permitted to deduct   capital   losses   to the extent   of capital   gains,   and   up   to $3,000   of excess   losses   may   be   deducted   against   ordinary   income.   Unused   capital  losses   may   be carried   forward   indefinitely   by an   individual   taxpayer.  Taxable   Year   and   Accounting   Method.   Most   C corporations   have   the flexibility   to adopt   either   a calendar   year   or a fiscal year   as   their   annual accounting   period.9!   Certain   “personal   service   corporations”   must   use   a  calendar   year,   however,   unless   they   can   show   a   business   purpose   for  using   a fiscal year.92   For   this purpose,   a “personal   service   corporation”   is  one   whose   principal   activity   is the   performance   of personal   services   that  are   substantially   performed   by “employee-owners’”   who   collectively   own more   than   10   percent   (by   value)   of   the   corporation’s   stock.93   This generally   forces   most   personal   service   corporations   to   use   a   calendar year,   subject   to an   exception   in Section   444   which   permits   them   to elect to   adopt   or   change   to a fiscal   year   with   a “deferral   period”   of not   more than   three   months.%4   As   a   result,   a   personal   service   corporation   that  otherwise   would   be   required   to use   a calendar   year   may   elect   a taxable  year   ending   September   30, October   31   or   November   30.   To   prevent   any tax   savings   that   might   result   from   the   use   of a   fiscal   year,   personal service   corporations   making   a   Section   444   election   must   make   certain minimum   distributions   (e.g.,   primarily   of compensation)   to   employee-  87   T.R.C.   § 170(b)(2). 88   T.R.C.   §§ 461());   465(a)(1);   469(a)(2)(B),   G)(). 89   1.R.C.   § 162(m).  9   LR.C. §§ 1211, 1212.  91 See   generally I.R.C. § 441.

Deferral of income to shareholders is not treated as   a business purpose. Id. 93 [R.C.   §§  269A(b)(1); 441(i)(2). An   employee-owner   is defined as any employee   who owns,   on any   day  during   the  taxable year, any of  the outstanding stock   of  the corporation after  applying   certain   attribution rules.   I.R.C. § 269A(b)(2), as modified   by I.R.C. § 441(i)(2). 94 T.R.C. § 444(b)(2).   The   “deferral   period”   of  a taxable   year is the  number of months  between   the  beginning   of the  taxable   year elected   and  the  close of  the  required   taxable   year that  ends   within   the   taxable   year   elected.

For   example,   Section 267(a)(1)   provides   that   losses   from   sales   or   exchanges   of   property  between   an   individual   shareholder   and   a   more-than-50   percent-owned corporation   may   not be deducted.191   The   forced   matching   rules   in Section  267(a)(2)   prevent   an   accrual   method   corporation   from   accruing   and deducting   compensation   paid   to   a   cash   method   owner-employee   in   the  year   when   the   services   are   performed   but   deferring   payment   until   the following   taxable   year   to provide   the   employee   with   a timing   advantage. When   an   owner-employee   owns,   directly   or   indirectly,   more   than   50  percent   of the   payor   corporation,   the   corporation’s   deduction   is deferred until such   time   as the owner-employee   includes   the amount   in income.102  Credits. Like any   taxpayer engaged in business or investment activities, a corporation is entitled to several valuable tax credits.

For many years, most C  corporations   were subject to a corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).

MULTIPLE AND   AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS  Code: Skim §§ 1501-1503; 1504(a), (b); 1551;   1561; 1563.  For   example,   a   sole   shareholder   of   an   operating   business   that  generated   $1,000,000   of net   income   annually   might   have   been   tempted  to divide   the enterprise   into   20 separate   companies,   each   with   an   annual income   of $50,000   and   each   therefore   taxed   at a maximum   rate   of only 15   percent   under   the   pre-2018   rate   structure.   This   and   other   income- splitting   ploys   were   precluded   by Section   1561,   which   is now   limited   to  denying   multiple   accumulated   earnings   tax credits   to a “controlled   group of   corporations.”1°7   Generally   speaking,   corporations   are   a   controlled  group   if they   constitute   either   a “parent-subsidiary   controlled   group”   or  a “brother-sister   controlled   group”   under   ownership   tests in Section   1568.  The   Code   also   contains   provisions   which   permit   an   “affiliated   group  of corporations”   to   elect   to   consolidate   its   results   for   purposes   of tax reporting.!°8   In broad   outline,   the   effect of a consolidated   return   election  is   to   treat   the   affiliated   group   as   a   single   corporate   entity   for   tax  purposes.   The   consolidated   return   rules   are   covered   in   more   detail   in Chapter   13, and   selected   issues   involving   consolidated   returns   are   raised in the   context   of various   transactions   discussed   later   in this   book.   The ownership   test   applied   to determine   whether   corporations   are   affiliated,  however,   is used   in several   provisions   of Subchapter   C199   and   is worth   a  brief   glance   at   this   early   juncture.   Section   1504(a)(2)   employs   an   80  percent   of voting   power   and   value   standard   to test   corporate   ownership  of another   corporation.   That   standard   is met   if a corporation   possesses   at least   80   percent   of   the   total   voting   power   of   the   stock   in   another  corporation   and   has   at least   80 percent   of the   total value   of the   stock   of  such   corporation.

28  INTRODUCTION   PART 1  PROBLEM  Boots, Inc. is a “C” corporation engaged in the shoe manufacturing  business. Boots is a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer with   two   equal shareholders, Emil and Betty, who are unrelated cash method taxpayers. In  answering the questions below, assume for convenience that Emil   and Betty each are taxable at a combined federal and state flat rate of 40% on ordinary income and a combined flat rate   of 20% on qualified dividends and   long-term  capital   gains. During the current year, Boots   has the following income   and expense items:  Income: Gross   profit—-eale   of Inventory   <..1....- sen   ee   $2,600,000  Capital   gains .ncaussceeeaue Rake   ee   eee   $   200,000  Expenses   and   Losses:  Operating   Expensesjco.s-c:ss teen   ee   $   800,000  Equipment   purchase   (100%   expensed)   under   § 168(k)   $   800,000 Capital   lossésccucdncuiwine.ncete eee   eee   $   220,000  (a) Determine Boots, Inc.’s taxable income   and its tax liability for the current year.  (b) What result in (a), above, if Boots distributes its after-tax  profits to Emil   and   Betty as qualified dividends? (c) What result   in (a), above, if instead of paying dividends   Boots pays Emil   and   Betty salaries of $500,000 each? Has the effectiveness of  this traditional strategy to reduce the impact  of the double tax   on corporate earnings changed as a result   of  the 2017 Act?  (d) Consider generally whether there is any advantage to operating   Boots as a_ pass-through entity, such as   a  partnership, limited liability company, or S  corporation and, if  so, whether   Emil   and   Betty will qualify for the new 20% deduction for qualified business   income. What additional facts are necessary to evaluate this option?  E. CORPORATE CLASSIFICATION  1. IN GENERAL :  Code: § 7701(a)(3).  The classification   of a business   relationship may have   profound tax consequences. Entities   classified as C   corporations are subject to the  double   tax regime of Subchapter C,   while   the   tax treatment of  partnerships is governed   by the   single   tax pass-through   regime of  Subchapter K.   The   rules   governing   the   federal   tax   classification   of  business   enterprises   have a  rich   and   textured   history,   as   the   stakes   have

AN OVERVIEW OF THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER 1 AND SHAREHOLDERS  changed in response to shifting tax incentives to utilize one form of  business entity over another. After decades of strife, much eonfusion, and  reams of boilerplate classification opinion letters issued by high-priced counsel, there is good news. The Internal Revenue Service   simplified this topic considerably (and shortened your reading assignment)   by adopting a classification system that as a practical matter   permits a closely held  unincorporated business to elect its taxing   regime. For tax purposes, Section 7701 defines a corporation to include  “associations,   joint-stock companies,   and   insurance   companies.” Thus, if  an   entity is an unincorporated “association,” it will be classified as   a  corporation. The longstanding, now repealed classification regulations did   not   define   the term “association.” Instead, they listed six characteristics   ordinarily found in a “pure” corporation"!   and   went on to  explain that “an organization will be   treated as an association if the  corporate characteristics are such that   the organization more nearly  resembles a corporation   than a partnership or trust.”!!2 In applying this  resemblance test, characteristics common to corporations and  partnerships (associates and a business objective) were disregarded in classifying an   entity as an association or   a partnership. The remaining characteristics   (continuity of life, centralized management, limited  hability, and free transferability of interests) were   then weighted equally  and an organization   was classified as an association   only if it had three  of the remaining corporate characteristics.118 The   old   regulations   reflected   an   anti-association,   pro-partnership bias   which   redounded   to the benefit   of high-income   taxpayers   seeking   to  shelter   their   compensation   or   investment   income   with   losses   from  strategically   structured   activities   in   real   estate   and   other   tax-favored industries.   Limited   partnerships   became   the   vehicle   of choice   for these  “tax   shelters”   because   they permitted   losses   to pass   through   to investors,  allowed   the partners   to maximize   those   losses   by including   their   share   of partnership   debt in the basis   of their partnership   interests,   and provided  ‘ protection for the   limited partners   against   personal liability   for debts of the   enterprise. These goals   could not be achieved in a C or S corporation.  The Service’s effort to convince the   courts   that   limited partnerships  should be classified as “associations” was unsuccessful,'44   but it  continued to issue stringent   guidelines for limited partnerships   seeking  a favorable classification   ruling.!15 Most tax advisors bypassed the  ruling  process and   were able to structure   limited partnerships that would avoid  “association”   classification based on a well reasoned   opinion of  counsel.  = In   the   1980s,   limited liability companies   (LLCs)   emerged   on the  scene and   were   quickly   touted as the   “best   of all worlds”   alternative for  111 Reg. § 301.7701—2(a)(1)   (pre-1997). 2   Yd. 13 Reg. §  1.7701—2(a)   (pre-1997).  114 See   Larson v.

30 INTRODUCTION   PART 1  conducting a closely held business. An LLC is an unincorporated entity  in which the owners, called “members,” have limited liability for the  enterprise’s   debts and claims   even if they participate in management. Members of an LLC have great flexibility in structuring the governance of  their venture through the LLC’s “operating agreement.”   The Service |  gave a major boost to the LLC   movement by classifying a Wyoming LLC  as   a partnership for federal tax purposes.!16 That ruling was followed by  others making it clear that   an LLC could   be structured as either   an  association or a partnership depending on the flexibility provided by state law and the   desires of the members.!17 LLCs (including single- member LLCs) are now authorized in every state and the District   of  Columbia.  2.   CORPORATIONS   VS.   PARTNERSHIPS  a.   “CHECK-THE-BOX”   REGULATIONS  Code:   § 7701(a)(8).  Regulations:   §§ 301.7701—1(a)(1)   & (2); —2(a),   (b)(1)—(3),   (c)(1) & (2); —3(a),  (b)(1).  The “old” classification regulations   were based on the   traditional  state-law   differences between a pure corporation and other   types of organizations,   such as partnerships.U8 State law developments, however, largely blurred the classic distinctions between corporations  and unincorporated forms for doing business.   For example, the increasingly popular LLC offers all  its investors   (including   those involved  in management) limited liability   for obligations of the venture—a  characteristic   traditionally   available   only in a corporation—along with classification as a partnership for federal   tax purposes.  The Service eventually   concluded that   the state law differences  between corporations and   partnerships   had narrowed to such a degree that   the venerable   corporate resemblance test   for classifying unincorporated entities should be abandoned in favor of a simpler  classification regime that is generally   elective.9   To that   end,   the  regulations   discarded the old classification system, which   was de facto elective for individuals   with skilled   tax advisors, and   replaced it with a “check-the-box” system in which   most   new   unincorporated entities automatically are   classified as partnerships for federal   tax purposes  unless   the entity elects to be an association   taxable   as a C corporation.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  General   Classification   Rules.   The   regulations   only   apply   to entities  that   are   treated   for   federal   tax   purposes   as   being   separate   from   their  owners.!20   If an   organization   recognized   as   a separate   entity   for federal tax   purposes   is   not   a   trust,   it   is   a   “business   entity”   under   the  regulations.!2!   Certain   business   entities   are   automatically   classified   as corporations.122   Most   importantly,   a business   entity   organized   under   a federal   or   state   statute   that   refers   to the   entity   as   “incorporated”   or as   a  “corporation,”   “body   corporate,”   or   “body   politic,”   is   treated   as   a  corporation   for   federal   tax   purposes,!23   as   are   other   business   entities  taxable   as   corporations   under   other   Code   provisions,   such   as   publicly  traded   partnerships   which   are   treated   as   corporations   under   Section fauld444  Under   the   regulations,   a noncorporate   business   entity   (an “eligible entity”)   with   at least   two   members   is classified   as   a partnership   unless  an   election   is made   for the entity to be classified   as an   association.   Thus,  partnership   status   is   the   default   classification   for   unincorporated  entities   with   two   or more   members.!25 Single-Owner   Organizations.   The   regulations   treat   a noncorporate business   entity   that   has   a   single   owner   as   a   disregarded   entity  (sometimes   referred   to   as   a   “tax   nothing”).   A   single-owner   entity   is  disregarded   for   tax   purposes   and   treated   as   an   extension   of its   owner unless   the   entity   elects   to be classified   as   an   association   and   thus   taxed as a C corporation.126   Consequently,   if no such election is made,   the entity is treated   for federal   tax   purposes   as   if it were   a sole   proprietorship   (if owned   by   an   individual),   or   a branch   or   division   (if owned   by   another  business   entity,   such   as   a C corporation)!??  Foreign   Organizations. The regulations list certain business entities formed in  specific jurisdictions (e.g., a public   limited company formed in  Hong Kong) that will be automatically classified as   a corporation.128   In  the absence of a contrary election, other   foreign entities   are   classified as: (1)  a partnership if the   entity has   two or more members and at  least one  member does not have limited liability,   (2) an association if all members have limited liability, or (3) disregarded as an   entity separate   from its  EEE SS   ee  120 See   Reg. § 301.7701—1(a).  121 Reg. § 301.7701—2(a).  = 122 Reg. § 301.7701-2(b)(1)   through (8).  123   Reg. § 301.7701-2(b)(1). 124 Reg. § 301.7701—2(b)(7).

A   classification   election   under   the   regulations   may   be designated   as   effective   up   to   75   days   before   or   twelve   months   after   the election   is filed.130   The   election   generally   must   be   signed   either   by   (1) each   member   of the   electing   entity,   including   prior   members   affected   by a retroactive   election,   or (2) by an officer, manager,   or member   authorized to make   the election.13!   If an   entity makes a classification   election,   a new classification   election   generally   cannot   be made   for 60 months,   unless   the  Service   allows   such   an   election   and   more   than   50   percent   of   the  ownership   interests   in the   entity   are   owned   by persons   that   did   not   own  any   interests   when   the   first election   was   made.132  Change   in Number   of Members   of an   Entity.   The   regulations   provide that   the   classification   of an   eligible   entity   as   an   association   generally   is not   affected   by any   change   in the   numbers   of members   of the   entity.133 But   if an   eligible   entity   (such   as   a limited   liability company)   is classified  as   a   partnership   and   its   membership   is   reduced   to   one   member,   it  becomes a disregarded   entity.184 A single-member   disregarded   entity also  is classified   as   a partnership   if it gains   more   than   one   member. 135  Elective Changes in Classification. The regulations also prescribe the  tax consequences when an entity makes a valid   election to change its tax   classification. If a partnership elects to be reclassified as an  association, it is deemed to contribute all of its assets and liabilities   to  the association for stock and then to liquidate by distributing the   stock to its partners.136 If an association elects to be classified as  a partnership,  it is deemed to liquidate by distributing all of its assets and liabilities   to  its shareholders who then   contribute the assets and liabilities   to a newly formed partnership.137 If an association   with one owner elects to be classified as a disregarded entity, it is deemed to liquidate by distributing all of its assets and liabilities   to the   single owner.138 Finally, if a disregarded entity elects to be classified as an   association,   the owner is  129 ee Pe A Limited liability generally exists if the member has no  personal lability for the debts of or claims   against the entity by reason of bei  Soares as y by n of being  a member.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  deemed   to contribute   all of the   assets   and   liabilities   of the   entity   to the  association   for stock   in the   association. 139  The   tax   treatment   of a change   in classification   is determined   under  all   relevant   provisions   of   the   Internal   Revenue   Code   and   general principles   of tax   law,   including   the   step   transaction   doctrine.!4°   Careful  attention   should   be   paid   to the   deemed   liquidation   in this   setting   as   it  often   can   yield   adverse   tax   consequences.   An   election   to   change   the  classification   of an   eligible   entity   is treated   as   occurring   at the   start   of the   day for which   the   election   is effective.141  b.   PUBLICLY   TRADED   PARTNERSHIPS  Code:   § 7704.  For   a   brief   time   after   enactment   of the   Tax   Reform   Act   of   1986,  publicly   traded   partnerships   (“PTPs”),   also   known   as   “master   limited  partnerships,   surfaced   as   a refuge   from   the   costly   double   tax   regime   of  Subchapter   C. Unlike   an   S corporation,   a PTP   could   have   an   unlimited  number   of owners.   It   could   register   its   limited   partnership   interests,  known   as   “units,”   with   the Securities   and   Exchange   Commission,   and   the  units   were   freely   tradable   on   a   securities   exchange   or   in the   over-the- counter   market.   A profitable   PTP   thus   avoided   the   corporate   income   tax and   passed   through   its income   to noncorporate   limited   partners   at the  lower   individual   rates.  Alarmed at the  proliferation of PTPs and the potential   erosion of the  corporate tax base, Congress   responded   by enacting Section   7704, which classifies certain PTPs as corporations for tax purposes. As defined, a  “publicly traded   partnership” is any   partnership whose interests are:   (1) traded on an established securities market, or (2) readily tradable on a  secondary   market (or its substantial equivalent).142 The regulations  generally   provide that   an   interest is “readily   tradable” if “taking into  account all of the facts and   circumstances, the partners are readily able  to buy, sell,  or exchange their partnership interests in a manner that is  comparable, economically, to trading on an established securities  market.” 143 An important exception   from reclassification is provided for partnerships if 90   percent or more of   their   gross income consists of  certain   passive-type   income items (¢.g., interest, dividends, real property rents, gains   from the sale   of real property   and   income   and gains from certain   natural   resources activities).!44 These   excepted PTPs continue to  be treated as pass-through entities for federal   tax purposes.   As a result,  139 Reg. § 301.7701-3(g)(1)(Gv).  140 Reg. § 301.7701-3(g)(2).  141 Reg. § 301.7701-—3(g)(3)Q)-   Transactions   deemed to occur as   a result of the election  are  treated as occurring   immediately before   the   close   of the day  before   the   election is effective.

34 INTRODUCTION   PART 1  investors   in PTPs   will qualify to deduct   20 percent   of their allocable   share  of the   PTP’s   qualified   business   income   without   regard   to   the   general limitation   imposed   on   high-income   taxpayers.145   Many   PTPs   qualifying for this exemption   engage   in active   natural   resources   businesses,   such   as  exploration,   mining   and   production,   refining,   transportation   and   —  marketing   of oil and   natural   gas.   The   scope   of this   escape   hatch   came under   scrutiny   after several   large private   investment   firms   “went   public” using   a PTP   structure   under   which   they   offered   publicly   traded   limited  partnership   interests.   One   of the   largest   IPO   transactions   involved   The  Blackstone   Group,   a global   asset   firm   with   approximately   $88.4   billion  under   management   at the   time   it went   public.   In   addition   to providing  advisory   services,   Blackstone   manages   a   variety   of investment   pools, including   private   equity   and   venture   capital   funds,   real   estate partnerships,   and   hedge   funds.   During   its pre-IPO   history,   Blackstone qualified   for pass-through   tax treatment,   as a limited partnership,   and   it  sought   to continue   avoiding   the   corporate-level   tax   as   a public   company  by employing   the   PTP   structure   and   qualifying   for   the   passive   income exception   even   though   the   bulk   of its profits   are   derived   from   an   active money   management   business.1!46   In 2019,   however,   Blackstone   changed  its   mind   and   announced   its   intention   to   become   a C   corporation.   The  reduction   in   the   corporate   tax   rate   and   the   disfavor   of   institutional  investors   and   stock   indexes   for   the   PTP   structure,   as   well   as   the  complexity   of   tax   compliance   for   individual   shareholders,   influenced  Blackstone   and   several   other   large   firms   to become   C corporations.   !47 3.   CORPORATIONS   VS.   TRUSTS  Regulations:   § 301.7701—4(a),   (b).  Trusts, like corporations, may be taxpaying entities, but the income  taxation of trusts differs from the taxation of corporations in several important respects. First, a corporation is taxed on its profits as they are earned   under the  relatively flat rates   in Section 11. If it later distributes  the remaining after-tax earnings as dividends, the shareholders are  subject to  a second tax. But there is no double tax  on   trust income. Under the complex rules   of Subchapter J,  trust income currently   distributed to  beneficiaries is generally not taxed to the trust. Rather, the income is  taxed to the   recipient   beneficiaries to the   extent of   the trust’s  “distributable net income.”148 If trust income is accumulated, it is taxed  to the  trust when earned   under the  rates   in Section L(e) but normally not  taxed   again when distributed to the beneficiaries.  45   T.R.C. § 199A(b)(1)(B), (e)(4)(A). Income   from a specified   service   trade or busi  conducted   by a PTP and a PTP’s   investment   income (e.g., interest and   dividends)   do  Bot cuit  for the 20  percent   deduction.   See   Reg. § 1.199A-6(c)(1).  M6 For  press   coverage of  this  transaction, see Anderson,   “Blackst Prepare to Miele ’   , one Founder  Count Their   Billions,”   N.Y.

5   AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  HAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  The   regulations   distinguish   between   “ordinary   trusts”   created   to  take   title   to property   for the   purpose   of protecting   and   conserving   it for  the   beneficiaries,   and   “business”   or   “commercial”   trusts   which   are  created   to carry   on   a business   for profit. An   ordinary   trust   is classified   as a “trust”   and   taxed   under   Subchapter   J.149 A business   trust,   on   the other  hand,   is   a   business   entity   that   is   classified   under   the   check-the-box  regulations.!59   Because   a business   trust   is an   unincorporated   entity,   it  will be classified   as   a partnership   for federal   tax   purposes   if it has   two   or more   members   and   does   not   make   an   election   to   be   classified   as   a corporation.151  F.   THE   COMMON   LAW   OF   CORPORATE   TAXATION  Although   the   study   of corporate   taxation   principally   involves   the  application   of complex   statutes   to particular   transactions,   the Code   is not the   only   analytical   tool.   In scrutinizing   taxpayer   behavior,   the   courts   at an   early   date   went   beyond   the   literal   statutory   language   and   began   to formulate   a set of doctrines   that have   become   the “common   law”   of federal  taxation.   Some   of these   principles,   such   as   the   assignment   of income  doctrine,   were   encountered   in   the   basic   income   tax   course.   Unlike   the  Code,   which   often   provides   bright-line   rules   for   solving   problems,   the  judicial   doctrines   are   imprecise.   The   very   vagueness   of   these  pronouncements,   however,   has   contributed   to their   influence.   When   the  system   is   working,   they   loom   large   in   the   responsible   tax   advisor’s conscience   and   serve   to thwart   aggressive   schemes   that   literally   comply with   the   statute   but   are   incompatible   with   its intended   purpose.!*?   This  introductory   survey   is intended   to preview   some   of the reasoning   that lies at the   heart   of this tax jurisprudence.  Viewed most broadly, the   judicial doctrines   ask a simple   question  that is central to almost every   transaction   studied in  this text. Have the  taxpayers actually done what they, and their documents, represent, or are the economic realities   of  the transaction—and the attendant tax  consequences—other than what the taxpayers   purport them to be? The  tests used to resolve this question   bear many labels which are often used interchangeably. What follows is a summary of  the terminology that will soon become familiar.  Sham Transaction Doctrine. If  a transaction is a “sham,” it will not be   respected for tax purposes. A “sham” is best   defined as   a transaction  that   never   actually   occurred   but is represented   by the taxpayer to have  transpired—with favorable tax consequences of  course.153 One court   has  “colorfully described a sham as an “attempt   by a taxpayer to ward off tax  149 Reg. § 301.7701-4(a).  150 Reg. §  301.7701—4(b). 151 Reg.   §§ 301.7701—2(c)(1);   —3(a),   (b)(1)Q). 152 See   generally   Bittker   &  Lokken,   supra   note   1, {| 4.3.1.  153 See,   e.g., Knetsch v.

INTRODUCTION   PART 1  blows   with   paper   armor,”!54   in a purported   transaction   that   “gives   off an unmistakably   hollow   sound   when   it is tapped.”155  Because   a   “sham”   often   connotes   near   fraudulent   behavior,   the  courts   tend   to   reserve   this   doctrine   in   its   purest   form   for   the   more  egregious   cases.   But   the pejorative   term   also is used   to describe   the kinds of transactions   that   are   challenged   under   the related   economic   substance  doctrine.   In   one   typically   overlapping   formulation,   the   Fourth   Circuit articulated   the following   two-part   test   to define   a sham:156  To   treat   a transaction   as   a sham,   the   court   must   find   that  the   taxpayer   was   motivated   by no   business   purpose   other   than  obtaining   tax benefits   in entering   the   transaction,   and   that   the  transaction   has   no   economic   substance   because   no   reasonable  possibility   of a profit exists.  Economic   Substance   Doctrine.   The   economic   substance   doctrine   is  one   of the   IRS’s   principal   weapons   in its assault   on   abusive   tax   shelters.  Its   essence   is   that   claimed   tax   benefits   should   be   denied   if   the  transactions   that   give   rise   to them   lack   economic   substance   apart   from  tax   considerations   even   if the   purported   activity   actually   occurred.   Most  courts   have   been   receptive   to   the   doctrine,   but   they   disagree   over   its  proper   formulation.157   Some   apply   a conjunctive   two-part   test   requiring a   taxpayer   first   to   establish   the   presence   of   economic   substance   (an objective   inquiry)   and   then   a   business   purpose   (a   subjective   test).158  Others   use   a narrower   disjunctive   approach   that   respects   a transaction if it has   either   a business   purpose   or   economic   substance.159   Still   others  treat   economic   substance   and   business   purpose   as   “precise   factors”   to consider   rather   than a   rigid   test.160   The   courts   also   disagree   regarding  164 Waterman Steamship Corp. v. Commissioner, 430   F.2d   1185 (5th Cir.1970), cert.  denied,   401 U.S.   939,   91   S.Ct. 936 (1971).  155 Id. at 1196, quoting   United States v.

Cl. 716, 752-756 (2004), where the court   held   that   the economic   substance doctrine was   unconstitutional   because  it violated separation of powers principles. This outlier decision was   reversed on appeal by the  Federal Circuit, which described   the trial court’s decision as “untenable”   and   upheld the  doctrine as   a permissible tool of construction that allowed courts to look beyond the literal language of a statute if  a  strict construction   would violate   legislative   intent.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  the   type   of non-tax   economic   benefit   that   a   taxpayer   must   establish   to  demonstrate   economic   substance.!61  After   many   years   of   controversy,   Congress   finally   codified   the economic   substance   doctrine   to   clarify   how   and   when   that   doctrine  should   be applied   and   to sharpen   its bite   with   a strict   penalty   regime. 162 This   new   and   as   yet   untested   statutory   weapon,   and   the   corporate   tax shelters   that   prompted   its enactment,   are   discussed   in Chapter   14, along with   several   other   corporate   tax   anti-avoidance   rules. Substance   over   Form.   The   form   of   a   transaction   frequently   is determinative   of its tax consequences.   Since   the early days   of the income  tax, however,   the courts   have   been   willing to go beyond   the formal   papers  and   evaluate   the   “substance”   of a transaction.   A familiar   example   is the  proper   classification   of a business   arrangement   as a   sale   or   a lease.163 The   documents   used   by the   taxpayer   may   use   one   label,   but   the   courts  are   not   inhibited   from   examining   the   arrangement   and   restructuring   it  for tax   purposes   to comport   with   the   economic   realities.  The tension between form   and   substance will be  evident throughout  the chapters that follow. Is a corporate instrument “debt,” as the taxpayer contends, or “equity,” as the Service often may assert? Is   a  payment to   a shareholder-employee really “compensation” or iseivre  disguised dividend, or vice versa, depending on the revenue effect of  reclassification? Who, in substance, made a sale  of corporate assets—the  corporation or its shareholders? It  is impossible to generalize as to when and how this doctrine will be applied. Individual cases turn on the particular facts and the court’s attitude toward tax avoidance. Despite the influence of this doctrine over   time, some courts have  shown reluctance to accept attempts by the Service to restructure  legitimate   transactions to reach a result   that will produce   more revenue.  The   Tax Court, for example, has   been wary of extending the judicial doctrines where   Congress has mandated that particular results shall  flow from a given   form   and the taxpayers   have carefully structured an otherwise legitimate   transaction to comply with the statutory requirements. 16  Business   Purpose. The business   purpose doctrine is conceptually  linked to the sham and   substance-versus-form tests. A transaction  motivated   by a business   purpose   usually is compared to one   that has no  substance,   purpose or utility apart   from tax avoidance.   As originally  161 One widely   used   formulation   requires an   objective determination of whether a “reasonable possibility   of  profit”   exists or, put differently,   finds   no economic   substance if there is no reasonable   expectation of a pre-tax profit  for the transaction   under scrutiny.   See, e.g., Dow Chemical Co. v. United States,   435   F.3d   594   (6th Cir. 2006);   Rice’s Toyota   World v. Commissioner, supra   note   156. 162 T.R.C. § 7701(0).

INTRODUCTION   PART   1  formulated   by   Judge   Learned   Hand,!6   the   business   purpose   doctrine  was   applied   to deny   tax-free   status   to a transaction   that   would   not   have  been   consummated   but   for the   tax   savings   that   would   result   if its form were   respected.   The   doctrine   took   hold   and   has   become   an   independent requirement   for tax recognition   of many   corporate   transactions. 166 Step   Transaction   Doctrine.   When   courts   apply   the   step   transaction doctrine,   they   combine   (or   “step”)   formally   distinct   transactions   to determine   the tax treatment   of the single integrated   series   of events.   The doctrine   frequently   is applied   in conjunction   with   the other judicial   tests. The   courts   disagree   on   the   standard   to be employed   in applying   the step   transaction   doctrine.   Some   require   a binding   legal   commitment   to  complete   all   the   steps   from   the   outset   before   combining   them,   while others   require   only a “mutual   interdependence”   of steps or a preconceived intent   to reach   a particular   end   result.167  The meaning and scope of all this common law tax jurisprudence has befuddled (and yet challenged) tax advisors for decades. Our   modest goal at this early juncture is  to identify the principal terminology   and give fair warning that literal compliance with the Code may or may not be enough  for a transaction to pass muster. Students should not expect a tidy or  consistent   articulation of the fuzzy judicial doctrines. It will be enough to  develop a sense of smell for the kinds of cases in which the doctrines  might be invoked.  G. RECOGNITION OF THE CORPORATE ENTITY  The   premise   underlying Subchapter   C is that a corporation is an entity separate and apart from its shareholders. In addition to questions  of  classification, issues have arisen over   the years as  to whether an   entity organized as a corporation under state law   should be respected as such  for tax purposes. These cases   often involve corporations that are formed to avoid state usury   laws or   to act as nontaxable agents of a related  partnership. The case below is the Supreme Court’s most recent pronouncement on this issue.  Commissioner v. Bollinger  Supreme Court of the United States,   1988.  485 U.S.   340, 108 S.Ct. 1173. = JUSTICE   SCALIA delivered   the opinion of  the   Court.’  [Jesse   Bollinger,   individually   and   through   partnerships   with others,  was a developer of apartment   complexes in Kentucky.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  were   financed   in   part   by   loans   from   commercial   lenders.   The   loan  commitments   were   made   to Creekside,   Inc.,   a wholly   owned   corporation  formed   by   Bollinger   to   circumvent   state   usury   laws   that   capped   the  interest   rate   on   loans   to noncorporate   borrowers.   Without   the   ability   to  charge   higher   interest   rates,   the   lenders   would   not   have   been   willing   to  provide   financing.   The   loan   agreements   provided   that   the   corporation  would   hold   legal   title   to the   real   estate   as   Bollinger’s   agent.   Creekside had   no   obligation   to   maintain   the   apartment   complexes   or   assume   any liability   and   Bollinger   agreed   to   indemnify   the   corporation   from   any  liability   it might   sustain   as   his   agent   and   nominee.   Similar   financing  arrangements   were   used   for   other   projects.   For   one   of the   ventures, Bollinger   and   one   other   owner   used   another   corporation   to   act   as  borrower   and   titleholder.  Construction   and   permanent   loans   for the   projects   were   made   to the  corporations   but   Bollinger   was   the   general   contractor.   He   also   managed the   complexes,   which   during   the   years   in   controversy   generated   net losses   that Bollinger   and his partners   reported   on their individual   income tax   returns.   The   IRS   disallowed   the   losses,   contending   that   the corporations   owned   the   real   estate.   The   Tax   Court   and   the   Sixth   Circuit  sided   with   the   taxpayers,   holding   that   the   corporations   were   merely  agents   and   should   be   disregarded   for tax   purposes.   The   Supreme   Court  granted   certiorari,   presumably   to revisit   two   prior precedents   and   clarify the   appropriate   standards   for   recognizing   a   corporate   entity   for   tax  purposes.   Ed.]  i.  For federal income tax purposes,   gain or loss from the sale or use of  property is attributable to the owner of the property.   ** * The   problem  we face here is that two different taxpayers can plausibly   be regarded as  the owner.   Neither the Internal Revenue Code nor   the regulations promulgated   by the Secretary of the Treasury provide significant  guidance as   to which should be selected. It is common ground   between the parties, however, that if  a corporation holds title to property as agent  for a partnership,   then for tax purposes the partnership   and not   the  corporation is the owner. Given agreement on   that premise, one would  suppose that   there would be agreement upon the conclusion as   well. For  each of respondents’ apartment complexes, an agency agreement expressly   provided that   the corporation   would “hold   such   property as nominee   and   agent for” the partnership,   and that   the partnership   would  have sole control   of and responsibility for the apartment complex.   The -partnership in each   instance   was identified as the  principal and   owner of  the   property   during   financing,   construction,   and   operation. The lenders,  contractors,   managers,   employees,   and   tenants—all   who   had   contact  with   the development—knew that   the  corporation   was   merely the   agent  of  the  partnership, if they  knew of the  existence   of  the  corporation at all.  In   each   instance   the   relationship   between   the   corporation   and   the  39

40   INTRODUCTION   ParT   1  partnership   was,   in   both   form   and   substance,   an   agency   with   the  partnership   as   principal.  The   Commissioner   contends,   however,   that   the   normal   indicia   of  agency   cannot   suffice   for   tax   purposes   when,   as   here,   the   alleged  principals   are   the   controlling   shareholders   of   the   alleged   agent corporation.   That,   it asserts,   would   undermine   the   principle   of Moline  Properties   v.   Commissioner,   319   U.S.   486,   63   S.Ct.   1132,   87   L.Ed.   1499  (1943),   which   held   that   a corporation   is a separate   taxable   entity   even   if  it has   only   one   shareholder   who   exercises   total   control   over   its affairs. Obviously,   Moline’s   separate-entity   principle   would   be   significantly compromised   if   shareholders   of   closely   held   corporations   could,   by  clothing   the   corporation   with   some   attributes   of agency   with   respect   to  particular   assets,   leave   themselves   free at the end of the tax year   to make  a   claim—perhaps   even   a   good-faith   claim—of   either   agent   or   owner status,   depending   upon   which   choice   turns   out.to   minimize   their   tax  liability.   The   Commissioner   does   not   have   the   resources   to   audit   and  litigate   the   many   cases   in   which   agency   status   could   be   thought  debatable.   Hence,   the   Commissioner   argues,   in this   shareholder   context  he   can   reasonably   demand   that   the   taxpayer   meet   a   prophylactically clear test   of agency.  We agree with that principle, but the question remains whether the test the Commissioner proposes is appropriate. The parties have   debated  at length the significance of our opinion in National   Carbide Corp. v.  Commissioner, supra.   In  that case, three corporations that were wholly owned subsidiaries of another   corporation agreed to operate their  production plants as “agents” for the parent, transferring to it  all profits  except for a nominal sum. The subsidiaries reported as gross income only  this sum,   but the Commissioner concluded that they   should be taxed on  the  entirety of the profits because   they were not  really agents. We agreed, reasoning first, that   the mere fact of the   parent’s   control   over   the  subsidiaries did   not establish   the existence of an agency, since such  control is typical   of all shareholder-corporation relationships, id., 336 U.S. at 429-434, 69 S.Ct.,   at 730—732;   and second,   that   the agreements  to pay the parent all profits above a nominal amount were not  determinative since income   must be  taxed to those who actually   earn it  without   regard to anticipatory assignment, id., at 435-436, 69 S.Ct.,   at  733-734, We acknowledged,   however, that   there was   such a thing as “a true corporate   agent ... of  [an] owner-principal,” id., at 437,   69   S.Ctenat  734, and   proceeded to set forth  four indicia and   two requirements of such status,   the sum of which   has become   known in  the lore   of federal income  tax law as the “six National   Carbide factors”: “[1] Whether the   corporation   operates in  the name   and for the account of  the principal, [2] binds   the  principal by its actions, [3] transmits   money received to   the   principal,   and [4] whether receipt   of income is attributable to  the   services   of employees of  the   principal   and to  assets   belonging to  the   principal   are   some

e   AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  HAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  of the   relevant   considerations   in   determining   whether   a   true  agency   exists.   [5] If the   corporation   is a true   agent,   its relations with   its principal   must   not be dependent   upon   the fact that   it is  owned   by   the   principal,   if such   is   the   case.   [6]   Its   business  purpose   must   be   the   carrying   on   of the   normal   duties   of an  agent.”   Id., at 437,   69   S.Ct.,   at 734   (footnotes   omitted).  We   readily   discerned   that   these   factors   led   to   a   conclusion   of  nonagency   in   National   Carbide   itself.   There   each   subsidiary   had  represented   to   its   customers   that   it (not   the   parent)   was   the   company  manufacturing   and   selling   its   products;   each   had   sought   to   shield   the  parent   from   service   of   legal   process;   and   the   operations   had   used  thousands   of the   subsidiaries’   employees   and   nearly   $20 million   worth   of  property   and   equipment   listed   as   assets   on   the   subsidiaries’   books.   Id.,  at 425,   434,   438,   and   n.   21, 69 S.Ct.,   at 728,   732-733,   734,   and   n. 21.  The   Commissioner   contends   that   the   last   two   National   Carbide  factors   are   not   satisfied   in the   present   case.   To   take   the   last   first:   The  Commissioner   argues   that   here   the   corporation’s   business   purpose   with respect   to the   property   at issue   was   not   “the   carrying   on   of the   normal duties   of an   agent,”   since   it was   acting   not   as   the   agent   but rather   as   the  owner   of the   property   for purposes   of Kentucky’s   usury   laws.   We   do not  agree.   It assuredly   was   not   acting   as the owner   in fact, since   respondents  represented   themselves   as   the   principals   to   all parties   concerned   with  the   loans.   Indeed,   it was   the   lenders   themselves   who   required   the   use   of a corporate   nominee.   Nor   does   it make   any   sense   to adopt   a contrary-to- fact   legal   presumption   that   the   corporation   was   the   principal,   imposing  a federal   tax   sanction   for the   apparent   evasion   of Kentucky’s   usury   law. To   begin   with,   the   Commissioner   has   not   established   that   these  transactions   were   an   evasion.   Respondents   assert   without   contradiction  that   use   of agency   arrangements   in order   to permit   higher   interest   was  common   practice,   and   it is by no   means   clear   that   the   practice   violated  the   spirit   of the   Kentucky   law,   much   less   its   letter.   It might   well   be  thought   that   the borrower   does   not   generally   require   usury   protection   in  a   transaction   sophisticated   enough   to   employ   a   corporate   agent—  assuredly   not   the   normal   modus   operandi   of the   loan   shark.   That   the statute   positively   envisioned   corporate   nominees   is   suggested   by   a  provision   which   forbids   charging   the   higher   corporate   interest   rates   “to  a corporation,   the principal   asset   of which   shall be the ownership   of a one  (1) or   two   (2) family   dwelling.”   Ky.Rev.Stat.   § 360.025(2)   (1987)—which  would   seem   to   prevent   use   of the   nominee   device   for   ordinary   home-  _mortgage loans.   In  any event,   even if the  transaction did  run   afoul   of  the  usury law, Kentucky, like most States, regards   only   the   lender as the usurer,   and the borrower as the  victim.   See  Ky.Rev.Stat. § 360.020   (1987)  (lender   liable   to borrower for   civil penalty), §  360.990   (lender   guilty   of  misdemeanor).   Since   the Kentucky statute imposed no   penalties   upon  the   borrower for allowing   himself to be victimized,   nor   treated   him as   in  pari   delictu,   but   to  the   contrary   enabled   him to  pay   back   the   principal  41

42  INTRODUCTION PART 1  without   any   interest,   and   to sue   for double   the amount   of interest   already  paid   (plus   attorney’s   fees),   see   Ky.Rev.Stat.   § 360.020   (1972),   the   United States   would   hardly   be vindicating   Kentucky   law by depriving   the usury  victim   of tax   advantages   he   would   otherwise   enjoy.   In   sum,   we   see   no  basis   in   either   fact   or   policy   for   holding   that   the   corporation   was   the  principal   because   of the nature   of its participation   in the loans. Of more   general   importance   is the   Commissioner’s   contention   that the   arrangements   here   violate   the   fifth   National   Carbide   factor—that  the corporate   agent’s   “relations   with   its principal   must   not   be dependent upon   the   fact.   that   it   is   owned   by   the   principal.”   The   Commissioner asserts   that   this   cannot   be   satisfied   unless   the   corporate   agent   and   its shareholder   principal   have   an   “arm’s-length   relationship”   that   includes  the   payment   of   a   fee   for   agency   services.   The   meaning   of   National Carbide’s   fifth factor   is, at the risk of understatement,   not   entirely   clear.  Ultimately,   the   relations   between   a   corporate   agent   and   its   owner- principal   are   always   dependent   upon   the   fact   of ownership,   in that   the  owner   can   cause   the   relations   to be   altered   or   terminated   at   any   time.  Plainly   that   is   not   what   was   meant,   since   on   that   interpretation   all subsidiary-parent   agencies   would   be invalid   for tax   purposes,   a position  which   the National   Carbide   opinion   specifically   disavowed.   We   think   the  fifth National   Carbide   factor—so   much   more   abstract   than   the   others—  was   no   more   and   no   less   than   a   generalized   statement   of the   concern,  expressed   earlier   in our   own   discussion,   that   the   separate-entity   doctrine  of Moline   not   be subverted.  In any case, we decline to parse the text of National   Carbide as  though that were itself the governing statute. As noted earlier, it is  uncontested that the law attributes tax consequences of property held by  a genuine agent to the   principal; and we   agree   that it is reasonable for  the Commissioner to demand unequivocal evidence of genuineness in the  corporation-shareholder context, in order to prevent   evasion of Moline.  We see no   basis, however, for holding that unequivocal   evidence can only  consist   of the rigid requirements (arm’s-length   dealing   plus agency fee)  that the Commissioner suggests. Neither of those is demanded by the law  of agency, which   permits   agents to be unpaid family members, friends, or associates. See Restatement (Second) of Agency §§ 16,  21, 22   (1958). It  seems to us that the genuineness of  the agency   relationship is adequately assured, and   tax-avoiding manipulation   adequately avoided, when the  fact that   the corporation is acting as agent for its shareholders   with respect to   a particular   asset is  set forth   in a written agreement at the time   the   asset is acquired,   the corporation   functions as agent   and not  principal   with   respect to the   asset for all purposes,   and the corporation is held  out as the agent   and not  principal   in all dealings   with   third  parties  relating to the   asset. Since   these requirements   were   met   here,   the  judgment of  the   Court of Appeals is  Affirmed.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  m JUSTICE   KENNEDY   took   no   part   in the   consideration   or decision   of this  case.  H.   TAX   POLICY   ISSUES  1.   INTRODUCTION  In   the   first   edition   of this   book,   published   over   35   years   ago,   we  observed   that “[t]he corporate   tax   system   previewed   here   is not engraved  in stone,”   and   predicted   that   “change   is in the   air, and   tax   lawyers   and  students   must   be   prepared,   often   at   a moment’s   notice,   to   discard   old  concepts   and   master   new   ones.”168   Before   the   ink   was   dry,   Congress enacted   the   historic   Tax   Reform   Act   of 1986.   Subsequent   developments,  most   recently   the   enactment   of the Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs   Act   in 2017,   have  contributed   to a dynamic   tax environment—and   frequent   revisions   of tax textbooks. And   so,   as   in every   prior   edition,   we   ask—what   of the   future?   In a few   previous   editions,   we   observed   that   the   spirited   tax   reform   debate  had   subsided.   That   is no   longer   true.   Corporate   tax   reform   returned   to  center   stage   to play a starring   role in 2017,   but   many   of the provisions   of the   2017   Act   are   only temporary   unless   Congress   chooses   to extend   them  or   make   them   permanent.   Tax   lawyers   (and   students)   must   continue   to  be   nimble   and   prepared,   often   with   little   notice,   to   discard   (or relearn) old   concepts   and   master   new   ones.   Today’s   law   may   be   tomorrow's history.   To   assist   in   that   aspect   of the   learning   process   and   provide perspective,   historical   and   policy   materials   have   been   interspersed throughout   the   text,   beginning   here   with   consideration   of the   pros   and  cons   of “integration”   of the   corporate   and   individual   taxes   and   other  corporate   tax   reform   options.   Additional   proposals   emanating   from  Congress,   the   Treasury   Department,   the   American   Law   Institute,   and commentators   are   considered   in   later   chapters   in   connection   with   the  specific   issues   and   trouble   spots   to which   they relate.  2. CORPORATE   INTEGRATION  Many economists   and   corporate   finance   theorists contend that   the  double tax   on corporate profits creates economic distortions and is inequitable,   especially when   compared to the pass-through   treatment available to businesses that   operate as partnerships,   limited liability companies, or S corporations. Calls frequently   have   been made for  “integration” of  the   individual   and   corporate   income taxes   into a single  comprehensive system,1®   and   Congress   gradually   has moved in   that 168 Lind, Schwarz,   Lathrope   & Rosenberg,   Cases   and   Materials on Fundamentals of  Corporate   Taxation   3-4 (1st  ed.   1985).  169 See, e.g., McLure,   “Integration   of  the   Personal   and   Corporate   Income   Taxes:   The  Missing   Element in   Recent   Tax   Reform   Proposals,”   88   Harv.

44 INTRODUCTION   PART 1  direction,   first   by   temporarily   reducing   the   tax   rate   on   qualified dividends   received   by noncorporate   shareholders   and   eventually   making the rate reduction   permanent   and   then   by lowering   the corporate   income  tax rate.170  Although   many   developed   countries   have   adopted   an   integration model   to tax business   income,17!   the   conventional   wisdom   is that   a fully  integrated   system   in   the   United   States   is   not   a   realistic   option.   A  separate   tax on corporations   is a politically popular   way   to raise revenue. Proponents   of   the   classic   double   tax   system   have   argued   that   the concentration   of economic   power   represented   by the   earnings   of at least public   companies   is an   appropriate   object   of a tax   system   that   purports to be built   on   principles   of fairness   and   ability   to pay.   Many   closely   held businesses   are   able to avoid   the double   tax by operating   as partnerships, LLCs,   or   S corporations.   Even   if they   do   not   qualify   for   pass-through treatment,   well-advised   closely   held   C corporations   historically   engaged in   “self-help”   integration   techniques   (such   as   payments   of   deductible  compensation   or   interest)   or   took   advantage   of targeted   tax   breaks   to  avoid   the   sting   of the   corporate   tax.   Moreover,   a large   of amount   of the  taxable   income   of publicly   traded   corporations   is only taxed   once,   at the corporate   level,   because   of the   significant   concentration   of stock   held   by  tax-exempt   pension   funds   and   charitable   endowments.   Finally,  transition   from   the current   system   to an   integration   model   would   present logistical challenges   and   years   of complexity   as the new   rules   are   phased  in.  Despite these   practical and political   realities, proponents of  integration   continue to argue that the corporate income tax increases the  cost of capital for U.S. corporations. It  is said to be an   indirect   tax   on shareholders rather than a cost of doing   business that is passed on to consumers. So   viewed, the   tax   violates notions of  vertical equity (by uniformly taxing income   earned indirectly by dissimilarly   situated  shareholders)   and horizontal   equity   (because income   earned   through a C corporation is taxed more heavily   than the same item of income   earned through a proprietorship, S corporation or partnership).1!72 Free-market economists   contend that integration would   encourage corporate   earnings  to be more freely distributed to shareholders, who then   could   decide  whether to reinvest in the business   instead of leaving   that reinvestment decision to corporate managers.  ; With corporate tax reform   always   seeming to be  on   the  front burner in the tax  policy conversation, it  is worth   pausing to consider how such a  taxing   regime that eliminates   separate   corporate   and   shareholder levels  Bar   Ass'n.

a   AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS HAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  of   taxation   might   be implemented.   The   potential   integration   models   fall  into two   broad   categories.   The   first,   referred   to   as   “full”   or   “complete”  integration,   would   eliminate   the   corporate   income   tax   and   apply   a pass-  through   taxing   system   to   C   corporations   and   their   shareholders.   A leading   alternative   is “partial”   integration,   which   typically   contemplates  different   types   of tax relief for dividends   paid by a corporation.   Variations include   giving   shareholders   a   tax   credit   equal   to   a   percentage   of  dividends   paid   or   allowing   shareholders   to exclude   from   gross   income   a  portion   of   dividends   received   during   the   year.   Alternatively,   the  corporation   could   be   permitted   to deduct   some   or   all of the   dividends   it pays   its shareholders.   The   excerpts   below   survey   the   major   integration  prototypes.

Background   and   Issues The present   law structure of a separate entity level tax  on corporate income has   long been   recognized to create a variety of economic  distortions. The two levels   of tax on corporate   form income (entity and  individual level),   as compared to the   single individual level tax imposed  on pass-through entities   (S-corps, partnerships,   LLCs), create a bias  against the corporate   form of organization; this   in turn limits investors’  access to publicly traded equity investment,   which may impose a  particular burden to smaller investors who are   less likely to have  significant   access to equity investments in pass-through entities. To the  extent   that   the two levels   of   tax impose a higher level   of   tax   on  investment generally,   the incentive to save is reduced. The resulting  increase in the cost  of  capital needed to finance new   investment will lead  to lower capital formation,   thereby   reducing future output   and productivity. An additional distortion   resulting from the present   law corporate income tax   rules is the incentive to finance new   investments from debt   rather   than   equity on account of the   deductibility of  interest  payments on debt   but no comparable deduction for dividends   paid on equity.39 Over-reliance on debt   financing can   increase bankruptcy risk.  Finally,   there may be incentives   created for the   retention of earnings in the  corporation, which   may lead to distortions in  the allocation   of  capital -to the  extent   that  corporations   with   current   earnings   have less favorable investment   opportunities   than   would their shareholders.*°   In   addition,  39 Some investors,   however,   may prefer   equity to debit * 40 The   two-tier   tax on   dividend   distributions   can make it more   desirable for  a corporation to  use   retained   earnings   rather   than   new   equity for  its investments.   Shareholders   can   find such  earnings   retention   attractive   (subject   to   the   accumulated   earnings   tax and   personal   holding  company   rules *  * * ) if  the   shareholder   expects   to  defer   tax   on   capital   gains   for a  substantial  45

46   INTRODUCTION   PART   1  present   law   results   in   considerable   complexity   and   tax   planning   as taxpayers   seek to structure   the most   tax-favorable   form   of doing business  and   providing   returns   to investors. At   the   same   time,   proposals   to   eliminate   separate   corporate   and  shareholder   levels   of taxation   (referred   to   as   “corporate   integration”)  involve   significant   policy   decisions   and   can   also   produce   considerable complexity.   Under   present   law,   although   the   Code   provides   rules   for imposing   separate   tax   at the corporate   and   at the   shareholder   level,   this  does   not   always   result   in   actual   payment   of two   levels   of tax.   In   some  cases,   the   amounts   that   are   distributed   to shareholders   may   have   borne  less   than a full tax   at the   corporate   level   due   to the   operation   of various  deductions,   deferrals,   or other   provisions   that have   reduced   or eliminated corporate   level   tax.   Also,   in some   cases,   shareholders   are   tax-exempt,   or  the   rate   of tax   the   shareholder   may   pay   is reduced   due   to capital   gains  treatment,   the   lower   rates   for   dividends   of individuals,   the   dividends-  received   deduction   for corporations,   step-up   in basis   of stock   at death,   or  other   provisions.   Thus,   under   present   law,   the   combined   individual   and  corporate   tax   rates   on   corporate   earnings   that   are   distributed   to shareholders   may   not   be   as   great   as   two   full   levels   of tax,   and   may   be  less   than   a   single   full   level   of tax.   If a   decision   were   made   to   increase  corporate   integration,   policy   decisions   would   need   to be   made   regarding  those   situations   in which   at least   one   level   of tax   should   be collected   and at   which   level   (corporate   or   shareholder)   it   should   be   collected.  Complexity   would   be   involved   in   co-ordinating   the   tax   results   at   the entity   and   individual   levels. As one example, consider a corporation whose earnings are subject  to little or no   tax due to tax incentives or preferences for particular   types of investment or business activities. Under present law, earnings of such  a corporation   distributed to taxable investors, or gains of such   investors  from   retained   earnings, may still be  taxed to the investors at the “second  level”   of tax. In considering a form of corporate   integration,   decisions  would   have be made whether to collect   at least one full level   of  tax or whether to pass through the   tax benefits to investors. If the latter  decision is made, issues may still arise regarding the appropriate  investors to receive   the benefit and how to treat situations where shares have changed   hands   between the time of the   tax benefited activities and the time of  the   distribution. Present   law rules for partnerships   contain  x  period or   to hold   stock until death (so that appreciation can   be passed to his   heirs free   of  individual income tax).  There also may be   an incentive under   present   law to retain earnings if the   corporation’s effective  tax  rate on reinvestment is lower   than the shareholder tax  rate on distributed   earnings By contrast, if the shareholder’s tax   rate is significantly   lower   than the   corporation’s   effective tax  rate—for   example, if the shareholder is a tax-exempt entity or   is entitled to   a corporate  dividends-received   deduction or   to the   lower   rates   on dividends to individuals, or   if the  distribution   can   be   structured as   a stock buyback eligible   for   capital   gains   rates   and   basis  recovery—there   may be a tax   incentive to distribute   earnings or   a reduced   incentive to retain  earnings.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  elaborate   rules   that   attempt   to prevent   the   misallocation   of certain   tax  benefits   to partners.  As   another   example,   consider   a corporation   that conducts   a business  activity   and   that   has   tax-exempt   shareholders.   Under   present   law,   the  income   from   the business   activity is taxed   at the corporate   level although  the   tax-exempt   shareholders   are   not   taxed   on   dividend   income   or capital  gain   from   their   investment.   Under   present   law,   the   single-level-of-tax  regimes   do   collect   a   business   income   tax   from   business   activities,   even when   there   are   tax-exempt   investors.   Thus,   if the   tax-exempt   corporate  shareholders   of C corporation   conducting   a business   were   instead   equity  owners   of a partnership   or   of an   S corporation   that   conducted   the   same  business,   they would   be subject to unrelated   business   income   tax on their  share   of   partnership   or   S   corporation   income   from   such   business, whether   or   not   distributed.   In   considering   a   form   of   corporate  integration,   a   decision   would   have   to   be   made   whether   to   continue   the  present   law   approach   that   the   presence   of tax-exempt   equity   investors  does   not   exempt   business   income   from   tax.4!  Foreign investment situations also present issues relating to the adoption   and design of an integrated   system. As one example,   under  present law,   the   U.S. collects a corporate level tax on U.S. corporate  income   and a withholding tax   on dividend distributions to foreign shareholders.#2   Integration   proposals that would unilaterally reduce the  tax on dividends to foreign   investors or provide refundable credits for any U.S. corporate tax paid could raise issues if foreign   countries   do not provide similar   benefits to U.S investors.  B.   Integration   Approaches A   number of methods could   be used to achieve full   or partial integration, each of which has   associated policy and   administrative  considerations. One form, known as   “full” integration,   involves passing through all  items of corporate income   and   deduction to shareholders,   including the  pass-through of items of a publicly-traded   corporation.   This approach would tax investors   currently on   their share of corporate income even if such income is not distributed to them. Full integration is considered to involve administrative difficulties   in determining a shareholder’s  41 Because present   law does   not impose tax   on interest payments to tax-exempt investors  _paid by  partnerships or S  corporations engaged in business activity, there is an   incentive for  tax-exempt investors to hold debt rather   than   equity of business conducted in such  pass-through forms   under   present law.   In considering   approaches to integration,   consideration may be given  to whether to continue this type of  difference in  the treatment of debt  and  equity when   imposing only a single  level  of tax. 42 However, interest   paid to foreign   shareholders is generally   not   taxed   by the US.  43 For a more   extensive   discussion   of the background   and   issues   relating to integration, see Michael J. Graetz   and  Alvin   C. Warren, Jr., Integration   of the U.S.   Corporate   and  Individual  Income   Taxes   (Tax Analysts,   1998);   Joint   Committee on   Taxation,   Federal   Income   Tax   Aspects of  Corporate   Financial   Structures,   JCS-1—89   (Jan.   18,   1989).  47

Tl INTRODUCTION   Bats  appropriate   share   of income,   especially   when   stock   changes   hands   during a corporate   taxable   year.  Other   forms   of integration   include   reduction   of the   corporate   tax   on  distributed   or   retained   corporate   earnings,   or   of the   individual   tax   on distributed   earnings   or   on   capital   gains   attributable   to   undistributed  earnings.   Complexity   can   arise,   however,   if it   is   desired   to   design   a  system   that   will   assure   the   collection   of one   level   of tax,   because   of the  necessity   for   mechanisms   that   assure   that   the   amounts   exempted   at  either   the   shareholder   or   corporate   level   in fact   are   taxed   at   the   other  level.  The   principal   approaches   to   integration   usually   discussed   involve forms   of dividend   relief   and   thereby   apply   only   to   distributed   earnings. One   approach   would   give   relief   by   allowing   the   corporation   or shareholders   to   deduct   or   exclude   a   portion   of   dividends.   Another approach   provides   a   credit   to   shareholders   for   taxes   paid   by   the corporation.   In   1992,   the   Treasury   Department   published   a   report  containing   a prototype   for a form   of dividend   relief through   exclusion   of  previously   taxed   dividends   from   shareholder   income.44   In   1993,   the American   Law   Institute   published   a proposal   involving   a credit   system  based   on   the   model   used   by   a   number   of   other   countries.45   Other  proposals   relating   to approaching a single   level of tax on   business   income  are   discussed   in the 2005   Report   of the President’s   Advisory   Panel   on Tax Reform.46  In 2003, the President’s budget proposals to the Congress contained  a dividend relief proposal that attempted to provide relief to shareholders  of corporations on dividends attributable to previously   taxed income of the corporation and also to provide a basis adjustment in a shareholder’s stock for undistributed   previously   taxed income allocated to such stock.47  Subsequently,   The Jobs Growth and   Tax Relief Act of 2003,   following a  dividend relief approach,   temporarily   reduced   and conformed (but  did  not  eliminate) the   tax   rates   on dividends   and capital   gains, through the end  of 2008.

This study also considered alternative  integration   prototypes. One was a “shareholder allocation” prototype that would tax both distributed and   retained earnings at the shareholder's tax rate. Another was a “Comprehensive Business Income Tax”   prototype that would, in effect, extend a dividend   exclusion system to payments of  interest, and   deny interest deductions, in order to equalize   the treatment of debt and equity; and that would tax corporate   and   noncorporate   businesses in the same   manner.

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  extended   this   rate   structure   though   2010   [and   it later   was   extended  again   through   2012   and   finally   made   permanent,   with   a   20   percent maximum   rate,   for tax   years   beginning   in 2013.   Ed.]. As   noted   previously,   a determination   whether   to adopt   a particular  form   of integration   involves   significant   policy determinations.   Among   the  policy decisions   are   whether   to pass   through   any   corporate   business   level  tax   benefits   to individual   investors;   how   to treat   income   attributable   to  tax-exempt   investors;   how   to   treat   international   transactions;   and   how  to   treat   existing   corporate   equity   investments.   Some   decisions   may   be  more   easily   implemented   if the   basic   form   of relief   is structured   as   a dividend   exclusion   at   either   the   corporate   or   shareholder   level.   Other issues   may   be more   readily   addressed   by giving   shareholders a credit   for  their   share   of the   corporate   tax   when   they receive   dividends.  In   addition,   a   system   imposing   only   one   level   of   tax   would   not  necessarily   be simpler   than   present   law.   For example,   the rules   for taxing income   of partnerships   (which   is subject   to tax   only at the   partner   level) are   quite   complex.   Similarly,   those   integration   approaches   that   provide  dividend   relief   and   that   also   seek   to collect   at least   one   level   of tax   can  involve   complexity.   This   can   result   from   the   need   to provide   rules   that  track   whether   income   has   borne   one   level   of tax   when   earned   at   the  corporate   entity   level   (or instead   has   enjoyed   tax benefits   that   reduce   or  eliminate   the   corporate   level   tax),   and   whether   the   particular   type   of  shareholder   to which   the income   is distributed   would   otherwise   generally  pay   tax   on   the   distribution,   absent   integration   relief.  NOTE After a flurry of  activity   in the   early and   mid-1990s, the integration debate went   back into hibernation. Historically,   the business community has not warmly   embraced the concept of integration,   preferring   instead to work within the   existing system with its many opportunities to minimize the  corporate income tax. Most corporate lobbyists   focus   their attention on expanding business tax preferences   (such as expensing the cost   of depreciable   property,   research   and development incentives, and targeted tax credits). In   the 2017 Act,   their efforts to repeal the corporate   alternative minimum tax were successful. Some   commentators have   suggested that corporate managers view   integration as a threat to their power base   because it would force them to act more as stewards of shareholder interests.173 It  seemed   more   and   more likely   that   integration would   remain a topic for  occasional academic discourse   rather   than a viable political  reality. President   George   W.   Bush revived   the   debate in early   2003   with  economic   stimulus legislation   that  included a bold  proposal for  a 100   percent  exclusion for   all dividends   paid out   of income   previously   taxed at the  corporate level. President   Bush’s   dividend   exclusion   proposal   received a  mixed   response   from   Congress   and   the   business   community.   Opponents 173 See, e.g., Arlen   &  Weiss,   “A  Political Theory   of  Corporate   Taxation,”   105 Yale   L.  J. 325  (1995).  49

INTRODUCTION   PART   1  argued   that   it was   too   complex,   favored   the   wealthy   without   providing   any  immediate   economic   stimulus,   and   contributed   to the federal   budget   deficit.  Tax-privileged   sectors,   such   as   issuers   of municipal   bonds,   banks,   insurance companies,   and   real   estate   investment   trusts,   were   concerned   that   their existing   tax   preferences   would   be   undermined.   Tax-exempt   shareholders,  such   as pension   funds   and   charitable   foundations,   as well   as companies   that  were   losing money   or able   to shelter   their   income   from   the   corporate   income tax, had   little to gain from   the   proposal. Supporters   argued   that   eliminating   the   double   tax   on   corporate  earnings   was   a long overdue   correction   to a flawed   system   that   encouraged  excessive   corporate   debt,   discouraged   the   payment   of dividends   and,   in so doing,   contributed   to a misallocation   of capital by favoring   retained   earnings over   cash   payouts.   Some   proponents   predicted   that   a full dividend   exclusion  would   make   corporate   managers   more   accountable   to   shareholders   and  increase   shareholder   confidence   in   the   credibility   of   corporate   earnings  reports.  It eventually   became   clear   that   the   dividend   exclusion   proposal   would  not   be   enacted   because   of its complexity   and   revenue   effect.   The   ultimate compromise—taxing   qualified   dividends   at   the   same   preferential   rates   as most   long-term   capital   gains—was   a   small   step   toward   integrating   the  corporate   and   individual   income   taxes.   Notably,   dividends   qualify   for   the  reduced   rate   whether   or not   they   are   paid   out   of income   previously   taxed   at  the   corporate   level.   Some   of the   details   are   discussed   in   Chapter   4. These  reduced   rates   were   scheduled   to   expire   at   the   end   of 2012   but,   to   avert   a  plunge   over   what   then   was   called   “the   fiscal   cliff,’   Congress   agreed   to   a  compromise   that   made   the   preferred   treatment   of   dividends   permanent,  albeit   at a slightly higher   maximum   rate   of 20 percent.174  3. OTHER   CORPORATE TAX REFORM OPTIONS  Even   though corporate   integration is the norm in many developed countries and enjoys wide   support   from   academics,   adoption of any of the integration models in the United States would be a radical   step   that is  unlikely to be taken   during the remaining life expectancy of the current  co-authors of  this text. But a more traditional approach to corporate tax  reform   always   was   within the realm of possibility. In the   years   prior to the passage of  the 2017 Act,   three broad   avenues for reform   enjoyed bipartisan   support: (1) lowering the statutory   corporate rates to make U.S. companies   more   competitive in the   global economy; (2) broadening the   tax   base; and (3) changing   and   simplifying   the.rules on how U.S.  companies with   foreign   active business   income are taxed .175  The   conventional wisdom was that any   corporate tax reform   option  that   lowers rates without   increasing   the deficit must   eliminate enough corporate   tax breaks to make the package   revenue-neutral. Examples of  euemuneiemeee   ee   ee  M4 Hor  high income   taxpayers,   the  rate   on long-term   capital   gains is actually   23.8   percent  because of  the  impact of  the net investment   income tax imposed   by  Section   1411.  5 For   an   entire   book   on   this   topic,   see   Shaviro,   Decoding   the   U.S.   Corporate   Tax   (2009).

AN   OVERVIEW   OF   THE   TAXATION   OF   CORPORATIONS  CHAPTER   1   AND   SHAREHOLDERS  popular   “tax   expenditures”   that   would   need   to   be   curtailed   were  accelerated   depreciation   for   plant   and   equipment,   tax   credits   for research,   taxpayer-friendly   provisions   benefitting   the   oil   and   gas  industry   and   many   more.   The   National   Commission   on   Fiscal Responsibility   and   Reform,   a   Presidentially-appointed   bipartisan   panel chaired   by Allen   Simpson   and   Erskine   Bowles,   issued   a report   in   2010  outlining   a blueprint   for rate   reduction   coupled   with base   broadening   and simplification.176   The   Commission   recommended   replacing   the   current corporate   tax rate   structure   with a single rate   between   23 and   29 percent  and   eliminating   all “special   subsidies”   for businesses.   Among   the   most prominent   “tax   expenditures”   targeted   for   repeal   were   accelerated   cost  recovery   methods,   various   tax   benefits   for the   oil and   gas   industry,   the  deduction   for   domestic   production   activities,   numerous   business   tax credits,   and   last   in-first   out   inventory   accounting.177   Many   of   the  Commission’s   recommendations   were   widely   praised   by   neutral  commentators,   but   the   Simpson/Bowles   blueprint   faded   quickly   when   it  failed   to gain   traction   on   either   end   of Pennsylvania   Avenue.  During this extended conversation, it became clear that   there was support for lowering corporate tax   rates but disagreement on the details  and trade-offs. Although most Republican legislators agreed that   the statutory   corporate tax   rates should be reduced to stimulate economic growth,   they   disagreed   about which corporate tax breaks   should be eliminated   and whether the   legislation must be revenue neutral. For most of  his two terms in office, President Obama agreed that corporate income tax   rates should be reduced in exchange for a broader base, but  he also promoted use of the tax system to stimulate certain types of  economic activity, such as clean   energy,   research, education   and jobs. As  in the debate over integration,   the business community has been divided.  Some sectors would   welcome a corporate tax   rate reduction   even if it  means fewer   deductions   and credits. Others, especially businesses that can reduce their   effective   tax   rates by using   targeted tax breaks, were  less enthusiastic. Owners of businesses   operating as pass-through entities (such as partnerships, LLCs and   S corporations) expressed  concern that they would not   benefit from a lower   corporate income tax rate and   might lose valuable tax breaks if the base is broadened.   Further  complicating the   task was the treatment of   U.S. multinational  corporations—a critical piece in the corporate tax reform puzzle. Any overhaul of   the   current   system   required lawmakers to confront the  complex issue   of how   and when multinational   corporations are taxed on the active business   income   they  earn   abroad.  In  2012,   the Treasury   Department issued a “framework” for business tax   reform. It proposed to reduce   the   corporate rate to 28   percent, eliminate   some tax expenditures   while   adding others, and   strengthen   the  176   Idoat   28:  177   Td. at 29.  51

52   INTRODUCTION   PART   1  international   tax   system,   all while   “not   adding   a dime   to the   deficit.”178 It   was   followed   in   2013   by   a   provocative   discussion   draft   of   small business   tax   proposals   and,   a   year   later,   by comprehensive   tax   reform  legislation   from   then   House   Ways   and   Means   Committee   chair   Dave  Camp.   The   Camp   reform   bill   included   repeal   of many   business-related  exclusions,   deductions   and   credits;   repeal   of the   alternative   minimum  tax;   reduction   of corporate   tax   rates;   and   a long   list of micro   and   macro changes   to   the   tax   treatment   of pass-through   entities.179   The   Senate  Finance   Committee   also   was   hard   at   work,   first   preparing   an   option  paper   on   taxation   of business   income   and   entities!89   and   later   issuing   a  Business   Income   Tax   Bipartisan   Working   Group   Report.!8!   The   Working  Group   agreed   on   several   familiar   principles   to drive   business   tax   reform: (1) lowering   tax rates   to encourage   economic   growth   and job creation   and to   create   an   internationally   competitive   tax   code;   (2)   addressing structural   biases   (e.g.,   debt   financing   over   equity);   (3)   promoting innovation   (e.g.,   through   a   permanent   research   and   development   tax  credit   and   source   neutral   incentives   for   energy   production);   and   (4)  simplifying   the   system.  Although the leaders of the congressional   taxwriting committees  continued to express optimism that corporate tax reform   was just around the  corner, it became clear that prospects for serious   legislation were slim to none until   after the 2016 election. And then, at last, proving that elections have   consequences, the Republican-controlled Congress narrowly passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The   2017 Act did not include any of the ambitious corporate   integration approaches. Instead, Congress  took a more   conventional route by reducing the corporate income tax  rate  but without the base broadening necessary to make the   overall legislation revenue neutral unless, as proponents of the Act have promised, the stimulus   provided by the lower rates and other   incentives  lead to a sustained   period of economic growth, more jobs, and enough  future revenue to balance the budget.  Many of the pro-business   provisions of the 2017 Act are temporary and even   the “permanent” corporate tax   rate reduction may be vulnerable if the balance of  political power should   change.

CHAPTER   2  FORMATION   OF   A  CORPORATION  A.   INTRODUCTION   TO   SECTION   351  Code:   §§ 351(a), (©), (d)(1)-(2); 358(a), (b)(1); 362(a), (e); 368(c); 1032(a); _—  1223(1), (2); 1245(b)(3). = Regulations: §§ 1.351—1(a), (b); 1.358-1(a), —2(b)(2); 1.362-1(a); 1.1032-  1(a), (d).  Policy   of Section   351.   In   order   to   commence   business   operations,   a corporation   needs   assets.   It normally   acquires   these   assets—known   as the   initial   “capital”   of   a   corporation—by   issuing   shares   of   stock   in exchange   for cash   or other   property,   or by borrowing.   When   a corporation  raises   its   equity   capital   by   issuing   stock   solely   for   cash,   the   tax  consequences   are   routine:   the   shareholder   simply   has   made   a   cash  purchase   and takes a cost basis   in the shares   acquired.!   If the corporation issues   stock   for   property   other   than   cash,   the   exchange   would   be   a  taxable   event   without   a   special   provision   of the   Code.   The   shareholder would   recognize   gain   or   loss   equal   to   the   difference   between   the   fair market   value   of the   stock   received   and   the   adjusted   basis   of the property transferred   to   the   corporation.2   The   exchange   also   might   be   taxable   to  the   corporation.   Its   gain—more   theoretical   than   real—would   be   the  excess   of the fair market   value   of the cash   and   property   received   over   the corporation’s   zero   basis   in the   newly   issued   shares. A simple example illustrates   the possibilities. Assume that A decides to form   Venture, Inc. by transferring   appreciated   property   with a value of $100   and a basis of $10 in exchange for Venture stock with a value of  $100. A would realize $90 of gain and, in theory, Venture   might be said to realize $100 of gain by issuing its stock. If both parties were   taxed on this simple transaction, however, corporate   formations   would be severely  impeded. To remove these tax   obstacles, Congress long   ago   decided that  routine   incorporations   should be   tax free to the shareholders   and the  corporation.   At the shareholder level, Section   351(a)   provides that   no  gain or loss   shall be  recognized if property is transferred to  a corporation  by one or more   persons solely   in exchange for its stock if the   transferor -or transferors of property are   in  “control”   of  the  corporation   “immediately  after  the exchange.”   Section   351   applies  both to transfers to newly formed and   preexisting   corporations   provided that   the   transferors   of property  have   “control” immediately after   the   exchange.   At   the   corporate level, Section   1032(a)   provides   that a corporation   shall   not   recognize   gain or  Tee   EG SAO? 2   [LR.C. §   1001(a).   55

56   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  loss   on   the   receipt   of money   or   other   property   in exchange   for its stock (including   treasury   stock).   These   general   rules   are   accompanied   by special basis   provisions   and   are   subject to several   exceptions,   all of which will be discussed   as   this chapter   unfolds.  The   policy of Section   351   is one   familiar   to nonrecognition   provisions.  The   transfer   of   appreciated   or   depreciated   property   to   a   corporation controlled   by the   transferor   is viewed   as   a mere   change   in the   form   of a shareholder’s   investment.   Consider,   for example,   the sole proprietor   who decides   to   incorporate   an   ongoing   business.   The   proprietor   clearly  realizes   gain   in a   theoretical   sense   when   the   assets   of the   business   are  exchanged   for   all   of the   new   corporation’s   stock.   But   he   has   neither  “cashed   out”   nor   appreciably   changed   the   nature   of his   investment.   He  owns   and   operates   the   same   business   with   the   same   assets,   only   now   in corporate   solution.   Incorporation   does   not   seem   to   be   the   appropriate  occasion   to impose a tax   if the   transferred   assets   have   appreciated   or to  allow   a deductible   loss if the assets   have   decreased   in value.  This policy is more difficult to defend in the case of a minority shareholder. Consider a taxpayer who exchanges appreciated land   with  a basis of $40   and a fair market value of $100 for a ten percent stock  interest in a newly   formed corporation   with a total net worth of $1,000. As a result   of the exchange, the taxpayer's continuing interest in the land  has been significantly reduced, and he now   owns a ten percent interest  in a variety of other assets. Presumably, the exchange should be taxable  and he should   recognize $60 of  gain. Similarly, if two or more   unrelated  taxpayers join together and transfer various assets to  a new corporation in exchange for its stock, they arguably   have changed the form of  their investment;   each now   owns a part of several   assets in corporate solution  rather than all of the   assets previously owned directly. Despite these arguments,   Congress chose not to make such fine distinctions, perhaps because its primary goal in enacting Section   351 was to facilitate a wide variety of corporate   formations.   Section   351   thus is broad enough to embrace transfers of property by a group of previously   unrelated persons—provided, of  course,   that the specific statutory requirements set forth below   have   been met.  Basic Requirements.   The three major   requirements to qualify for  nonrecognition of gain or loss under Section   351 are as follows: (1) One or more   persons   (including   individuals,   corporations,  partnerships   and other entities) must transfér   “property” to  the   corporation;  ee ate  3 See   Reg. § 1.1032—1(a).  4 But see   I.R.C. § 351(e)(1), which   disallows   nonrecognition in  the   case   of a “transfer   of  property to an investment   company.”   This   provision is intended to preclude a group of taxpayers  from achieving a tax-free   diversification   of their investment portfolios through   an exchange   with a newly   formed   investment   company.   See   Reg.   §  1.351-1(c)   for  the   details.

--- Page 127 ---

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  (2)   The   transfer   must   be   solely   in   exchange   for   stock   of the  corporation;   and  (3)   The   transferor   or   transferors,   as   a   group,   must   be   in “control”   of   the   corporation   “immediately   after   the exchange.” “Control”   for this   purpose   is defined   by Section   368(c)   as   “the   ownership  of stock   possessing   at least   80 percent   of the total combined   voting   power  of all classes   of stock   entitled   to vote   and   at least   80 percent   of the   total number   of shares   of all other   classes   of stock   of the   corporation.”   These  requirements   are   not   as   simple   as   they   may   first   appear.   Section   351  contains   several   statutory   terms   of art,   each   of which   has   raised   issues  over   the years.   Before   studying   the requirements   in detail,   however,   it is  necessary   to   complete   the   basic   statutory   scheme   by   turning   to   the corollary   rules   on   basis   and   holding   period.  Shareholder   Basis   and   Holding   Period.   If Section   351   applies   to   a  transfer,   any   gain   or   loss   realized   by   the   shareholder   is not   currently recognized.   The   policy   of   nonrecognition   requires   the   preservation   of these   tax   attributes   to prevent   total forgiveness   of the unrecognized   gain  or   forfeiture   of any   unrecognized   loss.   This   goal   is achieved   by   Section  358(a)(1),   which   provides   that   the   basis   of the   stock   (“nonrecognition  property”)   received   in a   Section   351   exchange   shall   be   the   same   as   the  basis   of the   property   transferred   by the   shareholder   to the   corporation—  an   “exchanged   basis”   in   the   jargon   of   the   Code.5   Returning   to   the introductory   example,   if A   transfers   property   to   Venture,   Inc.   with   a  basis   of $10   and a fair market   value   of $100   for stock   with   a value   of $100  in a   transaction   governed   by Section   351,   A’s   basis   in the   stock   will   be  $10. Assuming   no   decrease   in the value   of the   stock,   the   $90 of gain that  went   unrecognized   on   the exchange   will be recognized   if and   when A   sells  the   stock.é  In keeping with this   policy, Section   1223(1)   provides that where a  transferor receives property   with an exchanged basis, such as stock in a  Section   351 exchange, the holding   period of that property is determined  by including the period   during   which he  held   the transferred   property if  the transferred   property is  a capital   asset or   a Section   1231 asset; if  it  is  not, the  transferor’s holding   period begins on   the   date of the exchange. Tax   Consequences to Transferee   Corporation. On the corporate side, Section   1032   provides that a corporation   does   not recognize   gain or loss  when it issues   stock in exchange for money or property. Moreover, a  _corporation that   receives   property in exchange for its stock   in a Section 351 exchange steps   into   the   shoes of   the   transferor.   Section   362(a)  debt   20 Ss eee 5 TRC.   § 7701(a)(44). 6 Ifa   shareholder dies without selling   the   stock, however, his  basis   will be   stepped   up  (or down) to   its   fair market   value   on   the   date   of his death (or six months thereafter, if the alternate   valuation   date is  elected   for  federal   estate   tax   purposes).   I.R.C. § 1014(a).   This   would be the  case,   of course,   if  the  shareholder   had   simply   continued to  hold the  transferred   assets   out of  corporate   solution   and   thus   is  not   inconsistent   with   the policy of  Section   358.  57

58  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  generally   prescribes a “transferred basis”7—i.e.,   the corporation’s basis in any   property received in a Section   351 exchange is the same as the transferor’s basis, thus preserving the gain or loss inherent in the asset  for later recognition by the corporation. And Section   1223(2) provides  that if property has a transferred (also known as a carryover) basis to the corporation, the transferor’s holding period   likewise will carry over. Limitations   on   Transfer   of   Built-in   Losses.   When   controlling  shareholders   transfer   noncash   assets   to   a   corporation   in   a   Section   301  exchange,   the   economic   gain   or   loss   inherent   in those   assets   is reflected in both   the transferor’s   stock basis   and   the transferee   corporation’s   basis in the assets.   This   potential   for duplication   of the   same   economic   gain or loss   has   been   a longstanding   feature   of the   Section   351   nonrecognition scheme.   When   Congress   discovered   that   some   U.S.   corporations   were  exploiting   these   rules   by   deducting   the   same   losses   twice,   it did   what  came   naturally   and   enacted   yet another   statutory watchdog   to limit   the  recognition   of   losses.   In   so   doing,   it   not   only   curtailed   a   potentially  abusive   tax   shelter   but   also   adversely   affected   many   other   transactions  that   may   not   be motivated   by tax   avoidance. If property with a net built-in loss is transferred to  a corporation in  a Section   351 transaction or as a contribution to capital, the transferee  corporation’s aggregate   adjusted basis of such   property is limited to the fair market value of the transferred   property immediately after the transfer.§ This   limitation is applied on a transferor-by-transferor basis rather than to an aggregated group of transferors.? Transferred   property has a “net built-in loss” when the aggregate   adjusted basis of the property exceeds its fair market value.!° Any gain recognized by a transferor that increases the transferee   corporation’s basis in the transferred   property is  taken into account in determining   whether the transferred   property   has  a “net  built-in loss” in the transferee’s hands.11  ultiple properties are transferred in the same transaction, some  with built-in gains and others with builtin osses, the basis limitation only  applies when there is a net built-in loss.!2 If more   than one property with a built-in Toss is transferred, the aggregate   reduction in basis is  allocated among the properties in proportion to their respective built-in  7   LR.C.   § 7701(a)(43). 8   IR.C.   § 362(e)(2).  ®   Reg. § 1.362—4(b).  10 Reg. § 1.362—4(g)(3),   —4(h) Example 1. "Reg. § 1.362—4(h) Example 6. 12 I.R.C. § 362(e)(2)(A)(ii). Similar basis   limitation   rules apply to transactions where there  is an “importation of a net   built-in loss,” such as   a transfer   of  loss property to   a domestic corporation   by a person not   subject to U.S. tax. See   LR.C. § 362(e)(1). The   non-importation rule  is designed to prevent the   shifting   of losses from   transferors who are   not   subject to U.S.   tax  such as   a foreign   person or   a domestic   tax-exempt entity,   to transferees who are taxable snd  can   use   the loss.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  losses   immediately   before   the   transaction.13   Alternatively,   the  shareholder   and   the   corporation   may   jointly   elect   to   reduce   the shareholder’s   basis   in the   stock   that it receives   to its fair market   value.!4  The   amount   of basis   reduction   resulting   from   this   election   may   not   be  any   larger   than   what   is necessary   to eliminate   the   duplication   of loss in  the   transferred   assets.   Thus,   the   amount   of any   stock   basis   reduction  equals   the amount   of asset   basis   reduction   that would   have   been   required  under   Section   362(e)(2)   if the election   had   not been   made.!5   If the election  is made,   the   assets   continue   to   have   a   built-in   loss   in the   hands   of the  transferee   corporation,   but   the   loss   will   not   be   duplicated   on   the  disposition   of the   shareholder’s   stock.  More   to Come.   All these   basis   rules   are   subject to modifications   to be  discussed   later   in this   chapter,1®   and   both   Sections   358   and   362   apply   to  a   variety   of   corporate   transactions   other   than   Section   351.   For   the moment,   however,   it is best   to ignore   these   distractions   and   focus   on   the  policy   of continuity   of tax   characteristics   that   is an   essential   corollary   to  the   nonrecognition   principle   of Section   351.  PROBLEM  A, B,   C, D and £, all individuals, form X Corporation to engage in a manufacturing business. X issues 100   shares of common stock. A transfers  $25,000 cash for 25 shares; B transfers inventory with a value of $10,000   and a basis of $5,000 for 10   shares; C transfers unimproved land   with a value of $20,000   and a basis of $25,000 for 20   shares; D transfers equipment with a  basis of $5,000 and a value of $25,000 (prior depreciation taken   was $20,000)  for 25  shares; and   E transférs a $20,000 (face amount and value) installment  note for 20   shares. E received the   note in exchange for land   with a $2,000 basis   that he sold last year. The note is payable over a five-year   period, beginning in two years, at $4,000 per year   plus market rate   interest. (a) What are the   tax consequences (gain or loss recognized, basis  and holding   period in the   stock   received) to each of the transferors? As to E, see I.R.C. § 453B(a);   Reg. § 1.453-9(c)(2);  Prop.   Reg. § 1.453B—1(c). (b) What are the   tax consequences (gain recognized, basis and holding   period in each of the assets   received) to X Corporation?  Assume all the same facts except   that C transfers   two   parcels )  of unimproved land   (Parcel   #1   and Parcel #2), each   with a  N   or   ) value of $10,000. C’s basis   in Parcel #1 is $15,000   and C’s basis in Parcel   #2 is $8,000. What result to C  and X Corporation?  (d) There   was   $5,000 of gain inherent in  the inventory   transferred by B.

60   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  B sells   his   stock   for $10,000,   how   many   times   will that   $5,000  of gain be taxed?   Is there   any   justification   for this   result?  B.   REQUIREMENTS   FOR   NONRECOGNITION   OF   GAIN   OR  LOSS   UNDER   SECTION   351  The   introductory   problem   illustrates   that   a   tax-free   exchange   is easily   accomplished   if a   group   of   individuals   forms   a   corporation   by  transferring   property   solely   in   exchange   for   common   stock.   But  variations   abound   in the   world   of corporate   formations,   and   the   desires of the parties   for   a more   complex   transaction   may   conflict   with   the policy of nonrecognition.   This   section   explores   the   requirements   of Section   351  in   more   depth   and   shows   that   it   often   is   possible,   through   careful  planning,   to reconcile   these   competing   objectives.  1.   “CONTROL”   IMMEDIATELY   AFTER   THE   EXCHANGE  Code:   §§ 351(a);   368(c).  Regulations:   § 1.351—1(a)(i).  Section   351   applies only if the transferors of property, as   a group,  “control”   the corporation immediately after the exchange. For this  purpose, “control” is defined by Section 368(c) as: (1) the ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, and (2) at least 80 percent of the total number of shares  of all other classes of stock. The dual standard   apparently   was   designed  to ensure that  the  requisite   control would not exist unless the transferors owned more   than 80 percent of both the voting power   and the total value  of the corporation. Both   prongs of the   “control” test raise potentially thorny definitional questions—e.g., what is “stock   entitled to vote?”; how is “voting power”   determined? But these questions seldom arise   in  practice   either because the routine   corporate formation involves   only one  class   of voting common stock or the transferors of property collectively emerge from the exchange   owning 100 percent of all classes of stock. The requisite   control must be obtained by one or more transferors of “property” who act  in concert under a single integrated plan. There is no limit   on   the number of transferors, and   some may receive voting stock while   others   receive nonvoting stock. If the corporation issues more   than one class   of nonvoting stock, the   Service   requires   that   the   transferor  group   must   own at  least 80  percent of each class.17* To   be   part   of   an integrated plan,   the   transfers   need not   be simultaneous. It  is sufficient if the   rights   of  the   parties are “previously defined”   and the agreement   proceeds   with   an   “expedition   consistent   with orderly   procedure.”18 More   important   than   timing is whether the  transfers   are mutually   interdependent steps   in   the   formation   and  7   Rev.   Rul.   59-259,   1959-2   C.B.   115.  8   Reg.   §  1.851-1(a)(1).

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  carrying   on   of the business.   Thus,   it is possible   for transfers   separated   by  less   than an   hour   to be considered   separately   for purposes   of the   control  requirement   or   for transfers   several   years   apart   to be treated   as   part   of  an   integrated   plan.!9 Finally,   the transferors   of property   must   be in control   “immediately  after   the   exchange.”   Momentary   control   will not   suffice   if the holdings   of  the transferor   group   fall   below   the   required   80   percent   as   a   result   of  dispositions   of   stock   in   a   taxable   transaction   pursuant   to   a   binding  agreement   or   a prearranged   plan.2°   But   a voluntary   disposition   of stock,  particularly   in   a   donative   setting,   should   not   break   control   even   if the  original   transferor   of property   parts   with   the   shares   moments   after   the  incorporation   exchange.?!  As   illustrated   by the   case   below,   the   courts   have   taken   a practical approach   to this   much-litigated   issue,   focusing   less   on   timing   and   more on   the   previously   defined   rights   and   obligations   of the parties.  Intermountain   Lumber   Co.   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Tax   Court,   1976.  65   T.C.   1025.  m WILES,   JUDGE:   * * * [From 1948 until March, 1964, Dee   Shook owned a sawmill in  Montana,   where Milo Wilson   had logs processed into rough   lumber for a fee. The   rough   lumber was   processed into finished lumber at a separate plant jointly owned by Shook and Wilson. In March, 1964,   the sawmill was damaged by fire. Shook and Wilson wanted to replace it with a larger  facility, but Shook was financially unable to do so. Shook convinced  Wilson to personally coguarantee a $200,000 loan to provide   financing  and, in return, Wilson insisted on becoming an equal   shareholder with  Shook in the   rebuilt sawmill enterprise.  On May 28, 1964, Shook,   Wilson   and two   other   individuals  incorporated   S & W Sawmill, Inc. (“S & W”). Minutes of  the first meeting  of shareholders on July 7, 1964,   recited in part  that   “Mr. Shook   informed  the meeting that a separate agreement was   being prepared   between he and   Mr.   Wilson   providing for the sale   of one-half of  his stock to Mr. Wilson.”   Several   days later, Shook transferred his sawmill site toS & W in exchange for 364   shares of   S & W common stock. The company also  issued   one   share to each of its four   incorporators. No other   stock was issued. On the same day, Shook   and   Wilson   entered into “An Agreement  ~ for Sale and   Purchase of  Stock”   under   which   Wilson   was to purchase 182 19 Compare   Henricksen v. Braicks,   137   F.2d   632   (9th   Cir.1943),   with Commissioner v.  Ashland Oil & Refining Co., 99 F.2d   588   (6th Cir.1938). 20 See   American   Bantam Car   Co. v.

62  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  shares of Shook’s stock for $500 per   share, plus annual interest, to be paid in installments. As each principal payment on the purchase price  was made, a proportionate number of shares of stock were to be transferred on the corporate records and delivered to Wilson. A certificate for the 182 shares was placed in escrow. Shook also executed an irrevocable proxy granting Wilson voting rights in the 182   shares.  On   August   19,   1964,   S &   W   borrowed   $200,000   from   an   outside  lender,   in part   upon   the   personal   guarantees   of Shook   and   Wilson.   On  July   1,   1967,   the   taxpayer   in   this   case,   Intermountain   Lumber   Co. (referred   to in the opinion   as   “petitioner”),   acquired   all the outstanding   S  &   W   stock   from   Shook   and   Wilson.   S   &   W   became   a   wholly   owned subsidiary   of Intermountain,   and   the   companies   filed   consolidated   tax  returns   for the years   involved   in this   controversy.  The   specific   question   before   the Tax   Court   related   to the tax basis   of  S & W’s   assets   for purposes   of depreciation   claimed   on   the Intermountain  Lumber   group’s   consolidated   return.   In   a   role   reversal,   the   Service  contended   that the transfer   of assets   to   S & W   was   tax-free   under   Section  351,   requiring   S   &   W   to   take   a   transferred   basis   in   the   assets   under Section   362.   In support   of a higher   cost   basis,   the   taxpayer   argued   that the   incorporation   did   not   qualify   under   Section   351   because   Mr.   Shook  did not   have   control   immediately   after   the   exchange.   Ed.]  OPINION  Section   351   provides, in   part, that no gain shall be recognized if  property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons solely   in  exchange for stock or securities [“or securities” was deleted from the statute in 1989.   Ed.]   in such   corporation and immediately after the exchange such   person or persons are   in control of the corporation.  “Control” is defined for this purpose in section   368(c) as ownership of  stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock   entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock   of the corporation. In this   case, respondent is in the unusual posture of arguing that a transfer to  a corporation in return for stock was   nontaxable   under section 351, and Intermountain is in the equally unusual posture of arguing that the   transfer was   taxable because section   351 was inapplicable. The explanation is simply that Intermountain   purchased all stock   of the  corporation, S &   W, from its incorporators, and that Intermountain   and  S & W have filed consolidated income tax returns for years in   issue. Accordingly, if section   351   was   applicable to the incorporators when § & W was   formed,   S & W   and   Intermountain   must   depreciate   the   assets   of  S   & W on   their consolidated   returns on   the   incorporators’ basis.   Sec. 362(a).   If section   351   was   inapplicable,   and   the   transfer   of  assets to S& W was   accordingly to be   treated as   a   sale,   S &   W and   Intermountain could base   depreciation   on  those   returns   on  the  fair market   value   of  those  assets   at   the   time   of   incorporation,   which   was   higher   than   the

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF A CORPORATION  incorporators’   cost   and   which   would   accordingly   provide   larger  depreciation   deductions.   Secs.   167(g),   1011,   and   1012.  Petitioner   thus   maintains   that   the   transfer   toS   &   W   of allofS   & W’s   property   at the   time   of incorporation   by the   primary   incorporator,  one   Dee   Shook,   was   a   taxable   sale.   It   asserts   that   section   351   was  inapplicable   because   an   agreement   for sale required   Shook,   as part of the incorporation   transaction,   to   sell   almost   half   of   the   S   &   W   shares  outstanding   to one   Milo   Wilson   over a period   of time,   thereby   depriving  Shook   of the   requisite   percentage   of stock   necessary   for “control”   of S & W   immediately   after   the   exchange.  Respondent,   on   the   other   hand,   maintains   that   the   agreement  between   Shook   and   Wilson   did   not   deprive   Shook   of ownership   of the  shares   immediately   after the exchange,   as the   stock   purchase   agreement merely   gave   Wilson   an   option   to purchase   the   shares.   Shook   accordingly  was   in “control”   of the corporation   and the exchange   was   thus   nontaxable under   section   351.  Respondent   has   abandoned   on   brief his contention   that   Wilson   was a   transferor   of property   and   therefore   a   person   to   also   be   counted   for  purposes   of control   under   section   351.   Respondent   is correct   in doing   so, since   Wilson   did   not   transfer   any   property   to   S &   W   upon   its   initial formation   in   July   of   1964.   Wilson’s   agreement   to   transfer   cash   for corporate   stock   in March   of 1965   cannot   be considered   part   of the   same transaction.  Since Wilson was not a transferor of property   and therefore cannot  be counted for control under section   351, William A. James, 53 T.C. 638, 69 (1969), we must   determine if Shook alone owned the   requisite  percentage of shares for control. This determination   depends   upon whether,   under all facts and   circumstances   surrounding the agreement  for sale   of 182 shares between   Shook   and Wilson, ownership of those  shares   was in Shook or Wilson.  A determination of “ownership,” as that term is used in section   368(c)  and for purposes of control under section   351, depends   upon the  obligations and   freedom of action of the transferee   with   respect to the  stock when he   acquired it from the   corporation. Such traditional  ownership attributes as legal title, voting rights, and   possession of stock certificates   are   not  conclusive. If the  transferee, as part of  the transaction by   which the   shares   were   acquired,   has   irrevocably   foregone or  relinquished at that   time   the   legal   right to determine   whether to keep the   shares, ownership in such   shares is lacking for purposes of  section  851.   By contrast} if there are  no  restrictions upon   freedom of  action at the  time   he   acquired the   shares, it  is immaterial   how soon   thereafter   the  transferee elects   to dispose   of  his   stock or whether   such   disposition is in accord   with a preconceived   plan   not amounting to a binding   obligation. /  kk *

64   TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS   PART 2  After   considering   the   entire   record,   we   have   concluded   that   Shook and   Wilson   intended   to consummate   a sale   of the   S & W   stock,   that   they never   doubted   that   the   sale   would   be   completed,   that   the   sale   was   an integral   part   of the   incorporation   transaction,   and   that   they   considered themselves   to be coowners   of   S & W   upon   execution   of the stock purchase agreement   in   1964.   These   conclusions   are   supported   by minutes   of the  first stockholders   meeting   on   July   7, 1964,   at which   Shook   characterized  the   agreement   for sale   as   a “sale”;   minutes   of a special   meeting   on   July  15,   1964,   at which   Shook   stated   Wilson   was   to “purchase”   half of Shook’s  stock;   the   “Agreement   for Sale   and   Purchase   of Stock”   itself,   dated   July  15,   1964,   which   is drawn   as   an   installment   sale   and   which   provides   for  payment   of interest   on   unpaid   principal;   Wilson’s   deduction   of interest  expenses   in   connection   with   the   agreement   for   sale,   which   would   be inconsistent   with   an   option;   the   S &   W   loan   agreement,   in which   Shook and   Wilson   held   themselves   out   as   the “principal   stockholders”   of   S & W  and   in which   S &   W   covenanted   to equally   insure   Shook   and   Wilson   for $100,000;   the March   1965   stock   purchase   agreement   with   S & W,   which  indicated   that   Shook   and   Wilson   “are to remain   equal’   (emphasis   added) shareholders   in S & W; the letter   of May   1967   from   Shook   and   Wilson   to  Intermountain,   which   indicated   that   Wilson   owed   Shook   the   principal  balance   due   on   the   shares   as   an   unpaid   obligation;   and   all surrounding  facts   and   circumstances   leading   to corporate   formation   and   execution   of  the   above   documents.   Inconsistent   and   self-serving   testimony   of Shook and   Wilson   regarding   their   intent   and   understanding   of the   documents in   evidence   is unpersuasive   in   view   of the   record   as   a   whole   to   alter  interpretation   of the   transaction   as   a sale   of stock   by Shook   to Wilson.  We accordingly   cannot accept respondent’s   contention that   the  substance varied from the form of this transaction, which was, of course,  labeled a “sale.” The parties executed an “option” agreement on   the same  day that   the “agreement for sale” was executed, and we have no doubt that they could and   indeed did correctly distinguish between a sale and  an   option.  The   agreement for   sale’s forfeiture   clause, which   provided that Wilson forfeited   the   right to purchase a proportionate number of shares for which timely   principal payments were not made, did   not convert it into an option agreement.   Furthermore, the agreement for sale made no provision for forgiving   interest payments on   the remaining principal due ‘should   principal payments not be made on   earlier   dates;   indeed, it  specifically provided that “Interest payment   must   always be  kept  current before any   delivery of  stock is  to be made resulting   from a payment of  principal.”  We thus   believe   that   Shook, as part  of  the same   transaction   by which  the   shares   were   acquired   (indeed,   the agreement for   sale was   executed before   the   sawmill   was   deeded to S   & W),   had   relinquished   when he  acquired   those   shares   the legal right  to determine   whether to keep   them.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF A CORPORATION  stock   as he received   Wilson’s   principal   payments.   * * * We   note   also that  the   agreement   for   sale   gave   Wilson   the   right   to   prepay   principal   and  receive   all   182   shares   at   any   time   in advance.   Shook   therefore   did   not  own,   within   the   meaning   of section   368(c),   the   requisite   percentage   of  stock   immediately   after   the   exchange   to   control   the   corporation   as  required   for nontaxable   treatment   under   section   351.  We   note   also   that   the   basic   premise   of   section   351   is   to   avoid  recognition   of   gain   or   loss   resulting   from   transfer   of   property   to   a  corporation   which   works   a change   of form   only.   See   Bittker   &   Eustice,  Federal   Income   Taxation   of Corporations   and   Shareholders,   par.   3.01,   p.  3—4   (3d ed.   1971).   Accordingly,   if the   transferor   sells his   stock   as   part   of  the   same   transaction,   the   transaction   is taxable   because   there   has   been  more   than   a mere   change   in form. * * * In this case,   the transferor   agreed to   sell   and   did   sell   50   percent   of the   stock   to   be   received,   placed   the  certificates   in the   possession   of an   escrow   agent,   and   granted   a binding  proxy   to the purchaser   to vote   the   stock   being   sold.   Far   more   than   a mere  change   in form   was   effected. We   accordingly   hold   for petitioner.  NOTE  The Service has taken a pragmatic (some might say “nuanced”)   view of the  issue in Intermountain Lumber   when the subsequent disposition of  stock,  even though   pursuant to  a prearranged binding commitment, is not   taxable.  Revenue Ruling   2003-512? involved a plan by two   corporations,   referred to  here as X Co. and Y Co., to consolidate certain businesses in a holding company structure. To accomplish that goal, X Co. transferred   $40 of  business assets to a wholly owned subsidiary, X Sub Co., for X Sub Co. stock (the first transfer). Then, pursuant to   a preexisting agreement, X Co.  transferred its X Sub Co. stock to Y Sub Co., a subsidiary of Y Co.,  for stock of Y Sub Co.   (the second transfer). At the same time as the second transfer,  Y Co.  also contributed   $30 of cash to Y Sub Co. for additional stock   (the  third transfer).   Finally,   Y Sub Co. transferred its own business assets and the $30  it got from Y Co. to X Sub Co.   (the fourth transfer). When the   dust settled, X Co. and Y Co. owned 40 percent   and 60   percent,   respectively, of Y Sub Co.  and Y Sub Co. owned 100   percent of X Sub Co. The issue   in the   ruling was the   tax   results of the first transfer. X Co.   clearly would   have qualified for  nonrecognition of gain under Section   351 on   the first transfer   but for its  preexisting   obligation to also make the second transfer.   In holding that   the  first transfer satisfied   the   “control immediately after the exchange  requirement,”   Revenue Ruling   2003-51 distinguishes between   prearranged “dispositions of  stock   that   are taxable   and those   that   are nontaxable: Treating a transfer   of property   that is followed  by . . .a prearranged  sale of the   stock   received as   a transfer   described in § 351 is not  consistent   with   Congress’   intent   in enacting   § 351 to   facilitate  rearrangement of  the transferor’s   interest   in its property.

66  (   PROBLEM  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  a transfer   of property   that   is followed   by a   nontaxable   disposition  of   the   stock   received   as   a   transfer   described   in   § 351   is   not necessarily   inconsistent   with   the   purposes   of § 351.   Accordingly, the control   requirement   may   be satisfied   in such   a case,   even   if the stock   received   is transferred   pursuant   to a binding   commitment   in place   upon   the   transfer   of the   property   in exchange   for the   stock.  (Emphasis   added.)  Revenue   Ruling   2003-51   also   notes   that   its result   is supported   by the  fact that the transaction   could   have   been   rearranged   to more   directly   qualify for   nonrecognition   under   Section   351.   For   example,   X   Co.   could   have contributed   the   business   assets   directly   to   Y Sub   Co.   for Y   Sub   Co.   stock   at  the   same   time   as   Y   Co.   contributed   the   $30   of cash   to the   subsidiary.   Those  transfers   would   have   been   protected   by   Section   351.   Y   Sub   Co.   could   have then   transferred   its assets   to   a newly   formed   X Sub   Co.   in a second   tax-free  Section   351   exchange.   Thus,   Revenue   Ruling   2003-51   concludes   that  treating   X Co.’s   first transfer   as   within   Section   351   is not   inconsistent   with the purposes   of that   section. “Consider whether the following transactions qualify under Section 351:  (a) A and B are unrelated individuals. A forms Newco, Inc. on January 2 of the current   year by transferring a capital   asset  with a basis of $10,000   and a value of $50,000 for all 50 shares  of Newco common stock. On   March 2, in an unrelated  transaction, B transfers a capital   asset with a basis of $1,000  and a value of $10,000 for 10 shares of Newco nonvoting  preferred stock   (that is not nonqualified   preferred stock). (b) Same as (a), above,   except the transfers by A and B were part of a single integrated plan. (c) Same as (b), above,   except A transferred 25 of her   50 shares to her daughter,   D, as   a   gift on March 5   (three days after   B’s transfer). What if A’s gift  to D were on J anuary 5? (d) Same as (b), above,   except   that two months after   B’s transfer, A sold 15 shares to E   pursuant to   a preexisting oral  understanding,   without   which Newco would not have   been  formed.  2. ‘TRANSFERS OF “PROPERTY”   AND   SERVICES  Regulations: § 1.351—1(a)(1), (2). If the   transferors of “property” must   have control immediately after  the exchange, the   question   then   becomes:   what is “property?” Although  the term is not specifically   defined for purposes of Section   351, it has  been broadly   construed to include   cash,   capital   assets,   inventory,   accounts

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  receivable,   patents,   and,   in   certain   circumstances,   other   intangible  assets   such   as   nonexclusive   licenses   and   industrial   know-how.28  Section   351(d)(1)   specifically provides,   however,   that stock issued   for  services   shall   not   be   considered   as   issued   in return   for property.?4   This rule   makes   good   sense   in the case   of a promoter   of the   enterprise   or even the   company   lawyer,   each   of   whom   contributes   no   capital   but   still  receives   stock   in   exchange   for   services   rendered   to   the   corporation.  Inasmuch   as   the   stock   is   compensation   for   those   services,   the   tax  consequences   are   properly   determined   under   Sections   61   and   83. Apart   from   realizing   ordinary   income,   a person   who   receives   stock  solely   in   exchange   for   services   may   cause   the   other   parties   to   the incorporation   to recognize   gain   or   loss.   The   pure   service   provider   is not considered   a transferor   of property   and   may   not be counted   as part of the control   group   for purposes   of qualifying   the   exchange   under   Section   351.  But if  a person receives   stock in exchange th property and services,  all that shareholder’s stock is counted toward the 80 percent rol  requirement.?5  aie  These rules offer some   tempting opportunities for the   tax planner. Assume, for example, that Promoter and Investor join  forces to form a  new corporation. In exchange for his services, Promoter receives   25  percent of the corporation’s common stock. In exchange for $500,000 of highly appreciated property,   Investor receives   the   other   75   percent.  Investor, as the only   transferor of property,   does not have control and thus must recognize   gain on the transaction unless Promoter somehow  can   qualify as a transferor of property—a status   easily achieve erhaps, by the mere transfer of $100 in cash.  Life is not so simple in the world of Subchapter C. To   prevent   such  facile maneuvering around the   control requirement, the regulations  provide that   the   stock will not be   treated as having   been issued for  property if the primary purpose of the  transfer is  to qualify  the exchanges of the   other property transferors for nonrecognition   and if the   stock  issued to the eee art oe  ae in  comparison to the   value of the stoc already owned or  to be received for  services by the   transferor.?®   In  other   words, the accommodation transfer  gambit fails if the  value of  the property   transferred is de minimis relative to the   stock   received for services. This   regulation   has   been   interpreted  generously   by the  Service in Revenue   Procedure 77—37,27 which provides  that property   transferred “will not  be  considered to be of  relatively   small  ee See   et ee  23 See, e.g., E.I.

SOLELY   FOR   “STOCK”  Code:   Skim   § 351(g).  The   final   requirement   for   nonrecognition   is   that   the   transfers   of property   be   made   “solely”   in   exchange   for   “stock”   of   the   controlled corporation.   “Stock”   generally   means   an   equity   investment   in   the company,   and   in   this   context   the   term   has   presented   relatively   few definitional   problems.   It does   not   include   stock   rights   or   warrants.28   At  one   time,   Section   351(a)   applied   to   transfers   of   property   solely   in  exchange   for   both   stock   and   corporate   debt   securities,   but   the   term  “securities”   eventually   was   deleted.   A   “security”   was   construed   by   the  courts   as a relatively   long-term   debt obligation   (e.g.,   a bond   or debenture)  which   provided   the   holder   with   a   continuing   degree   of participation   in  corporate   affairs,   albeit   as   a   creditor.29   After   the   amendment,   debt  “securities received in a Section   351   transaction, along   with all forms of  nonsecurity debt (e.g., a short-term note), do not qualify as  nonrecognition property.  Certain   preferred stock with debt-like   characteristics,   labelled by  Section 351(g)(2) as “nonqualified   preferred stock,” is treated as “other property,” known in tax jargon as “boot”, rather than stock for purposes  of Sections   351 and 356 (relating to recognition of gain or loss on certain  otherwise tax-free corporate acquisitions). “Nonqualified preferred stock” is generally   defined as preferred stock39 with any of the following characteristics: (1) the stockholder   has the   right to require the issuing  corporation or   a “related person”?! to redeem or purchase the stock, (2) the issuer or  a related person is required to redeem or purchase the stock, (3) the  issuer or  a related person   has the right to redeem or purchase the  stock   and, as of the   issue   date, it is more likely than not   that such right  will be  exercised, or (4) the dividend rate   on such stock   varies in whole or in part with   reference to interest rates, commodity prices, or similar  indices.32 The first three of these   categories apply   only if the   right or obligation   with   respect to the redemption or purchase of the   stock may be  exercised   within the 20-year   period beginning on the issue   date of the  stock, and   such right or obligation is not   subject to  a contingency   which,  %  ta eye   Sh) iGeet   OF ee  28 Reg. § 1.351—1(a)(1), last sentence.  29 Camp Wolters   Enterprises, Inc. v.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF A CORPORATION  as   of the   issue   date,   makes   remote   the   likelihood   of the   redemption   or purchase.33  The   effect   of Section   351(g)   is to   treat   debt-like   preferred   stock   as  boot,   resulting   in potential   recognition   of gain   (but generally   not loss) to  the   recipient   under   Section   351(b).   A taxpayer   is allowed   to recognize   a loss,   however,   if only   nonqualified   preferred   stock   is   received   in   an exchange.#4   The   legislative   history   indicates   that   nonqualified   preferred stock   still will be treated   as “stock”   for all other   purposes   unless   and until  the   Treasury   provides   otherwise   in prospective   regulations   issued   under  the   authority   of Section   351(g)(4).35   This   hybrid   status   as   boot   for   gain  recognition   purposes   but   stock   for other   purposes   is more   significant   in  connection   with   tax-free   acquisitive   reorganizations,   which   are   covered later   in the text.36  PROBLEM Nate   Network   (“Nate”)   developed   an   idea   for   a   new   social   media  venture.   He   would   like   to   form   a   start-up   company,   raise   $150,000   of  additional   capital   and   hire   an   experienced   person   to manage   the   business.  He   has   located   Venturer,   who   is   willing   to   invest   $150,000   cash   and  Manager,   who   has   agreed   to serve   as   chief operating   officer   if the terms   are  right.  The parties have decided to join  forces and   form Newco Network, Inc. (“Newco”) as a “C” corporation. Nate will transfer   tangible assets and  intellectual property   with an aggregate basis of $50,000   and an agreed fair  market value of $200,000 (do   not be concerned with the character of the  individual assets for this problem); Venturer will contribute $150,000 cash; and Manager will enter into a five-year employment contract. Nate   would  like effective control of the business; Venturer is interested in a guaranteed preferred   return on   his investment but also wants to share in the growth of  the company; and Manager wants to be fairly compensated (she believes   her services are worth   approximately $80,000 per   year) and receive   stock in the  company, but   she cannot afford to make a substantial   cash investment. All  the  parties wish to avoid adverse tax consequences.  Consider the following   alternative   proposals   and evaluate whether they meét the   tax and   non-tax objectives of  the   parties: (a) In exchange for their respective   contributions, Nate will  receive 200   shares and   Venturer will receive   150   shares of Newco stock. Manager will agree to   a salary of $40,000 per  year for   five years and will receive   150   shares of Newco  common stock upon the  incorporation.

Any difference if Manager, unable to raise the   cash, gave  Newco her unsecured $150,000 promissory note, at market rate   interest, payable in five equal installments, in exchange  for her   150 shares?  (c)   Same   as   (a), above,   except   Manager   will pay   $1,000   for her   150  shares   and   the   incorporation   documents   specify   that   she   is receiving   those   shares   in exchange   for   her   cash   contribution  rather   than   for future   services.  (d)   Same   as   (c),   above,   except   Manager   will   pay   $20,000   cash  rather   than   $1,000.  (e)   Same   as (d), above,   except   Manager   will receive   only 20 shares of stock   without   restrictions;   the   other   130   shares   may   not   be sold   by   Manager   for   five   years   and   will   revert   back   to   the  corporation   if Manager   should   cease   to be an   employee   of the  company   during   the   five-year   period.   See   I.R.C.   § 83.   Would you   advise   Manager   to   make   a   § 83(b)   election   in   this situation?   What   other   information   would   you   need?  (f) In general, is there another approach to structuring the  formation of Newco that would harmonize the   goals of the founders?   Consider the   use of a capital structure with   two classes of  stock.  C.   TREATMENT   OF   BOOT 1.   IN GENERAL  Code:   §§ 351(b);   358(a), (b)(1); 362(a). Skim   § 351(g). Regulations:   §§  1.851—2(a); 1.3581, —2; 1.362-1. In   the introductory section of   this chapter, a simple example illustrated   the need for Section 351. Recall   that A decided to form Venture, Inc. by transferring   appreciated   property   with a value of $100  and a basis   of $10 in exchange for Venture stock with a value of $100.  Without a special provision of the Code, A would   have   recognized a $90 gain on   the exchange.   But since A received solely   stock and owned 100  percent of Venture, the transaction qualified for nonrecognition   under Section 351. To   preserve the   gain   that went   unrecognized, A took a $10 exchanged basis   in  the Venture stock under Section   358, and   Venture  took a $10   transferred   basis   in  the contributed assets under Section 362.  If A had   received more   than one   class   of stock,   the transaction still would have   qualified under   Section   351, and A   would   have   been   required to allocate  his aggregate   exchanged basis   of $10 among the  various   classes of  stock   received   in proportion to  their   relative   fair market values.37  ee 37 Reg.   § 1.8358—2(b)(2).

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A   CORPORATION  But   suppose   that   A,   perhaps   motivated   by   the   tax   advantages   of  corporate   debt,38   capitalizes   Venture,   Inc.   with   the   same   $100   asset   by  taking   back   common   stock   with   a value   of $80   and   a corporate   note   with  a   value   of   $20.   The   transaction   fails   to   qualify   under   Section   351(a)  because   A,   although   clearly   in   “control”   of Venture,   has   not   exchanged  his $100   asset   “solely”   in exchange   for stock.   A’s position   is not unlike   the  real   estate   investor   who,   desiring   a   tax-free   like-kind   exchange,   trades  his highly   appreciated   $500,000   building   in exchange   for other real estate  with   a   value   of $450,000   and   $50,000   of cash   to   even   out   the   deal.   The  question   for   both   A   and   the   real   estate   investor   becomes:   should   the receipt   of this   “boot”   require   full   recognition   of their   realized   gain,   or  should   there   be a statutory   middle   ground?  In the corporate   setting,   this question   is answered   by Section   351(b).  It provides   that   if an   exchange   otherwise   would   have   qualified   under  Section   351(a) but for the fact that the transferor   received   “other   property or money”   in addition   to stock,   then   the transferor’s   realized   gain (if any) must   be recognized   to the extent   of the cash   plus the fair market   value   of  the   other   property   received.   Translated   more   concisely,   Section   351(b) provides   that   any   gain realized   by a transferor   on   an   otherwise   qualified  Section   351(a)   exchange   must   be recognized   only to the extent   of the boot  received.   The   gain   is characterized   by reference   to the   character   of the assets   transferred,   taking   into   account   the   impact   of the   recapture   of  depreciation   provisions.®9   Despite   the   presence   of boot,   however,   no   loss  may   be recognized   under   Section   351(b).*  In   the example   where A receives $80 of stock and a $20   corporate note in exchange for his $100 asset with a $10 basis, Section   351(b) will  require A to recognize   $20 of his $90 realized gain.4! This makes sense,  of course, because to the extent that A has   transferred his asset in  exchange for property other than stock, he   has changed not merely the  form of   his investment but the substance as well. To that   extent,  nonrecognition   treatment is inappropriate.  As noted earlier, if a shareholder transfers property in a tax-free Section   351(a)   transaction, the unrecognized gain on   the  transfer will be preserved   through an exchanged basis   in the transferor’s   stock and   again through a transferred basis in the   corporation’s assets. But if   a shareholder   recognizes   some gain as  a result   of  the receipt of boot,  not all  of his realized   gain must be accounted for at a later   time. To   avoid this  a ag ee  38 See Chapter 3A, infra.  39 See   LR.C.   §§ 1245(b)(3);   1250(d)(3).   Also   relevant is LR Crs   1239,  which characterizes the recognized   gain on   the transfer   of depreciable   property to  a corporation as ordinary   income  if the   transferor   and certain   related   parties own   more   than   50   percent of  the   value of  the transferee   corporation’s stock.  40 See also   L.R.C. § 267(a)(1),   disallowing losses   on   sales or exchanges   between   related  taxpayers,   including   an   individual   and a corporation   more   than   50  percent in value   of which is  owned   by  the  individual   (actually or through   attribution   rules). 41 This   example   only   addresses   the   amount of A’s   gain.   The   timing  of  gain triggered   by  the receipt   of  installment   boot   is  considered   in  Section   C2  of the chapter,   infra.  71

72  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  potential double   recognition of gain, the shareholder may increase his basis in the stock, securities and other property received by an amount  equal to the gain recognized on the   transfer.42 This higher basis will  result in less gain (or more loss) if and when the shareholder later sells  the property received from the corporation.  The   shareholder’s   basis   in the   “nonrecognition   property”   (1.e., stock) received   from   the   corporation   thus   equals   the   basis   in   the   property  transferred   to the corporation,   decreased   by the fair market   value   of any other   property   and   the   amount   of cash   received,   and   increased   by the  gain recognized   on   the transfer.   The   boot   takes   a fair market   value   basis.  Since   any   gain recognized   by the   shareholder   is attributable   to the boot,  and   since his continuing   investment   is represented   by the nonrecognition property,   the   unrecognized   gain   inherent   in the   property   transferred   to  the   corporation   logically   should   now   be preserved   in the   nonrecognition  property.   These   goals   are   achieved   by assigning   the   boot   a   fair   market  value   basis   and   allocating   the   remaining   basis   to   the   nonrecognition  property.43  Applying these rules to our previoys example, if A received $80 of Venture, Inc. stock anda $20 note in exchange for his $100 asset with a basis of $10, his recognized gain would be $20—the fair market value of  the boot. A’s basis in the   note would be $20, its fair market value. A’s  basis in the stock would be determined as follows:  Basis of Asset Transferred $ 10 Less:   Fair Market Value of Note   Received (20)  Plus: Gain   Recognized 20 Basis of Stock $ 10  The arithmetic makes sense. Remember that   the value of the Venture  stock was $80. By assigning the   stock a $10 basis, Section   358   preserves  the $70 of realized gain that went   unrecognized on the   partially   tax-free  exchange.   There is no more gain to be preserved, so it is logical to give  the  boot a fair market value basis.44 At the corporate level, Section   362(a)   provides that   the  corporation’s basis   in the property   received on a Section   351 exchange is the same as  the  transferor’s basis, increased by  any   gain   recognized on   the exchange. This rule ensures that any   gain or loss not recognized:by the shareholder will be   reflected   in   the   corporation’s   basis   in the transferred assets.  Returning one last time to the example, since A recognized   $20 of gain on   the exchange,   Venture’s basis   in  the  transferred asset would be  $30 (a $10 transferred   basis   in  A’s hands plus   $20   gain   recognized),  # LR.C. § 358(a)(1)(B)(ii). 43 LR.C.   § 358(a)(2).  “4 As   before,   this example   only   addresses   the amount of  gain   recognized   under   Section  351(b)   and   the   resulting   basis   consequences.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  If a   transferor   exchanges   several   assets   in exchange   for   stock   and boot, the transaction   becomes   more   complex.   For purposes   of determining  the   gain   recognized   (and,   if relevant,   the   character   of   that   gain),   it  becomes   necessary   to   allocate   the   boot   among   the   transferred   assets.  Similar   allocations   are   required   to determine   the   basis   of the   assets   in  the hands   of the corporation.   Although   these   questions   rarely arise in the  routine   corporate   formation,   they   have   titillated   tax   commentators   and  caused   unnecessary   anguish   to   students   of corporate   tax.45   The   ruling below   is the   Service’s   attempt   at an   orderly   resolution   of this problem.  Revenue   Ruling   68-55  1968-1   Cum.   Bull.   140.  Advice   has   been   requested   as   to the   correct   method   of determining the   amount   and   character   of the   gain to be recognized   by Corporation   X  under   section   351(b)   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   of   1954   under   the  circumstances   described   below.  Corporation _Y was organized by X and A,_an   individual who   owned  no stock in X. A transferred 20x dollars to Yin exchange for stock of Y having a fair market.   value of 20x dollars and X transferred to Y three separate assets and received in exchange stock of Y having a  fair market value of 100x dollars plus  cash of 10x dollars.  In accordance with the facts set forth   in the  table below if X had sold at  fair market value   each of the three assets it transferred to Y, the  result would have   been as follows:  Asset I Asset IT Asset IIT  Character of asset................++.

The facts   in the  instant   case   disclose   that  with   respect to the section 1245 property the   depreciation   subject to recapture   exceeds   the amount of  gain  that would be  recognized on a sale at  fair market value.   Therefore, all of such   gain   would   be   treated as ordinary   income   under section 1245(a)(1)   of  the   Code.  ee Sp ee  45 For   the   seminal   article   on   boot   allocation,   see   Rabinovitz,   “Allocating   Boot   in  Section  351   Exchanges,”   24  Tax   L.

74  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Under   section   351(a)   of the   Code,   no   gain   or   loss   is recognized   if  property   is transferred   to a corporation   solely   in exchange   for   its   stock and   immediately   after   the   exchange   the   transferor   is in   control   of the corporation/If section   351(a)   of the   Code   would   apply   to an   exchange   but  for the   fact   that   there   is received,   in addition   to the   property   permitted to be received   without   recognition   of gain,   other   property   or money,   then  under   section   351(b)   of the   Code   gain   (if any)   to   the   recipient   will   be  recognized,   but   in an   amount   not   in excess   of the   sum   of such   money   and  the   fair market   value   of such   other   property   received,   and   no   loss   to the recipient   will be recognized/  The   first question   presented   is how   to determine   the amount   of gain to be recognized   under   section   351(b)   of the Code. Se   ee   ee  each   asset   transferred   must   be   considered   to   have   been   separately  exchanged.   See   the   authorities   cited   in   Revenue   Ruling   67-192,   CB.  1967-2   C.B.   140,   and   in Revenue   Ruling   68—23,   which   hold   that   there   is  no   netting   of gains   and   losses   for purposes   of applying   sections   367   and 356(c)   of the   Code.   Thus,   for   purposes   of making   computations   under  and   to subtract   this   total   from   the   fair   market   value  the total ideratio ived_in the exchange. Moreover, any  treatment other than an asset-by-asset approach   would have the effect  of allowing losses that are specifically disallowed by section   351(b)(2) of  the Code. The second   question presented is how, for purposes of making computations   under section   351(b) of the Code, to allocate the cash and  stock received to the amount realized as   to each asset transferred in the exchange. The asset-by-asset approach for computing the amount of gain  realized in the exchange requires that for  this purpose the fair market —value_of each category   of consideration   received must be   separatel allocated to the transferred assets in   proportion to the   relative fair  Income   Tax   Regulations   which, for the same reasons,   requires that for  purposes of computing the amount of gain to which section 1245 of the Code applies each   category of consideration   received must be  allocated to the   properties   transferred in proportion to their   relative fair market values. Accordingly, the amount and   character of the   gain  recognized in the  exchange should   be computed as follows: :

($18x)   $13x   $30x  Under   section   351(b)(2)   of the   Code   the   loss   of 18x   dollars   realized  on   the   exchange   of Asset   Number I is not   recognized.   Such   loss   may   not be used   to offset   the   gains   realized   on   the   exchanges   of the other   assets.  Under   section   351(b)(1)   of the   Code,   the   gain   of 13x   dollars   realized   on  the exchange   of Asset   Number   II will be recognized   as short-term   capital gain   in   the   amount   of 3x   dollars,   the   amount   of cash   received.   Under  sections   351(b)(1)   and   1245(b)(3)   of the   Code,   the   gain   of   30x   dollars  realized   on   the   exchange   of Asset   Number   III   will   be   recognized   as  ordinary   income   in the   amount   of 5x dollars,   the amount   of cash   received. NOTE  Overall understanding of Section   351 may be enhanced by an analysis of the additional results to the shareholder (“X”) and the corporation (“Y”) in the transaction   described in Revenue Ruling 68-55. X’s basis in the Y stock  received will be   an exchanged basis   ($40 from Asset I, plus $20   from   Asset  II, plus $25   from   Asset III = $85), increased by its total gain   recognized on the   transfer ($3  on Asset II, plus $5 on Asset   HI = $8) and   decreased by the  fair market value of the   boot   (including   cash)   received ($  10) for a total basis of $83 ($85 + $8 — 10). ‘  The next   question is X’s holding   period for the stock. X received stock worth   $100 together   with   $10   cash for assets with a value of $110 (Asset I  $22, Asset II $33, Asset III $55). Thus, it could   be said  that 22/110 of  the   stock  was   received in exchange for Asset I, 88/110 was received in exchange for Asset II, and °5/110 was   received in exchange for Asset III. In that  event, each   share  could   be   considered to have a  split holding   period   allocated in proportion to  the fair market value of  the transferred   assets.\This approach   was   adopted  “by the   Service in Revenue   Ruling 85—164.49   In so ruling,   the   Service   rejected  an   alternative   approach,   under   which   some   shares   would take a tacked  holding   period  and   other   shares a holding   period commencing.as of the date  of  the   exchange.   The latter approach   would   permit a shareholder   selling a  portion   of his  holdings to designate   shares   with   the  longer   holding   period.

--- Page 146 ---

76   TAXATION   OF C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  The   next   step   is a   determination   of Y’s   basis   in the   assets   received.   In  the ruling,   Y’s basis   in those   assets   will be their   adjusted   bases   in X’s hands  ($40 for Asset   I, plus $20 for Asset   II, plus   $25 for Asset   III) increased   by the gain   recognized   to X   (zero   on   Asset   I, plus   $3 on   Asset   II, plus   $5 on   Asset III) for   a   total   of $93   ($40   +   $20   +   $25   +   $3   +   $5).   Nothing   in   the   Code, regulations   or rulings   explains   how   this basis   is allocated   among   the   assets. The   underlying   premise   of Section   362,   however,   is that   any   gain   or   loss  which   is realized   but   not   recognized   by the   transferor   on   the   Section   351  transfer   will be recognized   by the corporation   on   a later   sale.   This   concept   is  carried   out   by giving   each   separate   asset   its original   transferred   basis   and then   increasing   the basis   by the amount   of gain recognized   by the transferor  on   that   asset.47   On   the   facts   in Revenue   Ruling   68—55,   Y’s   basis   in Asset   I would   be $40   (transferred   basis)   since   no   gain or loss was   recognized   on   that  asset.   If Y   sells Asset   I for its $22   fair market   value,   it then   will   recognize  the   $18 loss realized   but   not   recognized   by the transferor.   Y’s basis   in Asset  II   would   be   $23   (transferred   basis   of   $20   increased   by   the   $3   of   gain  recognized   on   Asset   II). Of the   $13   of realized   gain   on   Asset   II, $3   already  has   been   recognized,   and   Y will recognize   the   $10   additional   gain   if it sells  that   asset   for its fair market   value   of $33.   Finally,   Asset   III will take   a basis  of $30   (transferred   basis   of $25, increased   by $5 gain recognized)   so that   if Y  sold   the   asset   for   its   fair   market   value   of   $55,   it will   recognize   the   $25  additional   realized   gain that   was   not   recognized   by X.  2. TIMING OF SECTION 351(b) GAIN  Proposed Regulations: §§ 1.453-1(f)(1)(iii), —1(£)(3)(i), Gi),   Gii) Example  (1).  The   preceding discussion concerned the amount of gain recognized by a transferor who receives   boot in a Section   351   transaction. What about the timing of that gain?(If the   boot is cash or other corporate property,   the transferor   recognizes   any Section   351(b) gain immediately  upon receipt of the boot) But gain is more typically recognized when a  shareholder transfers appreciated   property in exchange for a mixture of stock and   corporate   debt instruments.48 In   that   event,   the question becomes—when must that gain   be recognized? And if the gain may be deferred, what is the resulting impact on   the shareholder’s basis   in her stock under Section   358 and the corporation’s   basis in its assets under Section   362? The   answers lie in the relationship between Section   351 and  the installment sale rules in Section 453.  For many years, it was not   clear whether a shareholder could   defer  the reporting of Section   351   gain   triggered by the   receipt   of corporate debt obligations. The   Code resolves this question in  an analogous   context  by  permitting rral   of gain for installment   boot   received in a Section  1031   Tike-kind   exchange   and   certain   other   corporate   nonrecognitton  — SN a  47   See, e.g., P.A.   Birren &   Son v. Commissioner,   116   F.2d   718   (7th   Cir.1940).  48 For  the   tax   incentives   to  capitalize   a corporation   with   debt,   see Chapter   3A1,   infra.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF A CORPORATION  transactions.‘   In proposed   regulations,   issued   in 1984   but still not made final,   the Treasury   extended   this rule   to allow_a transferor   who   receives  installment   boot   in   a   Section   351(b)   transaction   to   defer. gain until  payments   received   on_the-corporate_debt.59   These   regulations   also  permit   a   transferor   to   immediately   increase   the   basis   in   any nonrecognition   property   received   (e.g.,   stock)   by   the   transferor’s   total potential   recognized   gain, but they delay the corporation’s   corresponding  Section   362(a)   basis   increase   in   its   assets   until   the   transferor   actually  recognizes   gain   on   the   installment   method.5! The   operation   of the   proposed   regulations   is best   illustrated   by an example.   In a conventional   installment   sale (i.e.,   a deferred   payment   sale not   made   in   conjunction   with   a   nonrecognition   provision),   Section   453 directs   the   seller   to   construct   a   fraction   by   dividing   the   realized_gain  (known   in Section   453   parlance   as the “gross profit”) by the total   principal  payments   to be   rece   aA   ea (“total   contract   price”).5%   The   seller  then applies   the fraction to each   payment   received   to determine   the gain  recognized   in   the   year   of sale   and   as   installment   payments   are   later  received)Adopting   the   facts   of our   continuing   example,   assume   A   sells his   appfeciated   asset   (“Gainacre”),   which   has   an   adjusted   basis   of $10  and   a fair market   value   of $100,   for $80 cash   and   a $20 note   with   market  rate   interest   and   principal   payable   in equal   installments   over   the   next five   years.   A’s   realized   gain   is $90.   A’s   total   payments   received   will   be $100:   $80   in   the   year   of sale   and   $20   in   subsequent   years.   Under   the  installment   method,   2°/100,   or   90   percent,   of each   payment   received   must  be reported agtaxable gain.//   >   Satay   Senate   orks   ay  Now assume that A transfers Gainacre to Venture, Inc., in exchange  for 80 shares of Venture stock (worth $80), and a $20 Venture five-year  note. A again realizes $90  of gain   but   recognizes that gain   only to the extent of the $20 boot   received. For timing purposes,   the regulations divide   the exchange into two   separate transactions:\ a Section   351(a)  nonrecognition   exchange to the extent of the   stock received by the  transferor and (an installment sale to the  extent of the  boot received) The  basis of  the transferred   property is  first allocated to the nonrecognition transaction. The regulations implement this bifurcation approach as  follows:53 (1) A’s  basis in Gainacre ($10) is first allocated to the Venture  stock (“nonrecognition   property”)*4   received in the  exchange in  an amount up to the fair market value of  that  =   ——  49   T.R.C.   § 453(6)(6).  50 Prop.

For   this   purpose,   the   “selling   price”   is the   sum of the face valye of the installment   obligation   ($20 here) and the fair market   value   of any   other   boot (none here). Where,  as   here,   there   are   no   liabilities,   the   total   contract   price   is  the   same   as   the   selling   price   ($20).   The   gross   profit   is the  selling   price   less   any   “excess   basis”   allocated   to   the  installment   obligation   ($20 —   0 =   $20). A’s gross   profit ratio is thus   7°20,   or 100%.   To   determine   his   recognized   gain,   A applies   that   percentage   to any   boot   received   in the   year   of  sale   and   to   payments   "as Ty cake   ee  EnStaIMent   ots: Athus Teen eASOe a Bain ELOPENS  the exchange; His entire $20 “boot” gain is recognized   as the  note   is paid off over   the next   five years.   Note   that   the   gross  profit ratio is normally   100%   if the boot received   is less than  the   realized   gain.55  For purposes of determining a shareholder’s basis in the  nonrecognition   property received in a Section 351/453 transaction, the  regulations treat the shareholder as electing out of the installment  method.56 Returning to the example, A’s See Taocvaisieas stock under  Section   358 is $10, determined as follows: $10 (A’s basis in Gainacre)  decreased by $20 (total boot received by   A)   and   increased by $20 (the  entire gain A would   have   recognized if he  reported all his gain in the  year  of sale).  Determining the corporation’s   basis in the transferred   property is more   complicated. Adopting   what one commentator has called a  “rollercoaster   basis” approach,57 the regulations   provide   that   the  gross   profit  of $10   ($20   selling   price   less $10 excess   basis) and a gross   profit   ratio   of %.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  corporation’s   basis   in   the   transferred   property   is   the   same   as   the  transferor’s   basis   increased   by the   gain   recognized   only   if, as   and   when that   gain   is actually   recognized.   In the   example,   Venture   initially   takes  a transferred   basis   of   $10   in   Gainacre,   and   that   basis   gradually   is  increased   by   $20   as   Venture   pays   off   the   note   and   A   recognizes   his  deferred   gain   on   the   installment   method.58   Query   whether   this  rollercoaster   basis   approach   is appropriate,   considering   that   Venture   in  effect   has   incurred   a   liability   in   connection   with   its   acquisition   of  Gainacre.   If the   teachings   of the   Crane   case   are   followed,   it would   seem  that   Venture   should   be   permitted   to   increase   its   basis   by   the   full   $20  liability   notwithstanding   that A may   defer   his boot   gain   over   five years.  An   immediate   step-up   in   basis   of the   transferred   property   would   be  particularly   appealing   to   the   corporation   when   the   property   is  depreciable   real   estate   with   no   lurking   recapture   gain.  PROBLEM  A, Band C form X Corporation   by transferring the following assets, each  of which has been held long-term:  Transferor Asset Adj. Basis   F.M.V. A Equipment (all § 1245 gain) $15,000   $22,000  B Inventory $ 7,000 $20,000 Land $13,000   $10,000 C   Land "$20,000   $50,000  In exchange, A receives 15 shares of X common stock (value—$15,000), $2,000   cash and 100   shares of X preferred stock (value—$5,000), B receives  15 shares of X common stock (value—$15,000) and   $15,000 cash, and C  receives 10 shares of X common stock (value—$10,000), $5,000   cash and X’s note for $35,000, payable in two years. None of  the transferors is a “dealer” in   real   estate. Assume that   the preferred stock issued to A is not  “nonqualified   preferred stock.”  (a) What are the   tax consequences (gain or loss realized and recognized, basis and  holding period) of  the  transfers   described above to each   shareholder   and to X Corporation?  (b) What result to C in (a), above, if instead of  land, C transferred  depreciable equipment with the same adjusted basis and fair  market value as the   land   and an   original cost   to C of $50,000?

80  (   TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  D.   ASSUMPTION   OF   LIABILITIES  Code:   §§ 357(a)—(c);   358(d).   Skim   § 357(d).  Regulations:   §§ 1.357—1,   —2;   1.358—3.  Many   corporate   formations   involve   the   transfer   of   encumbered  property   or the   assumption   of liabilities   by the transferee   corporation. In most   circumstances,   a   taxpayer   who   is relieved   of a   debt   in   connection  with   the   disposition   of   property   must   include   the   debt   relief   in   the amount   realized   even   if the   debt   is nonrecourse.   This   is the   teaching   of the   celebrated   Crane   case,59   and   the   Supreme   Court   took   a   similar  approach   nine   years   earlier   in United   States   v.   Hendler.®°   Interpreting the   corporate   reorganization   provisions,   the   Court   held   in Hendler   that the assumption   and   subsequent   payment   of the transferor’s   liabilities   by  a transferee   corporation   constituted   boot   to   the   transferor.   If that   rul  applied   to   a   corporate   formation,   however,   many   incorporations   of   a  going business   would   become   taxable   events   to the extent   of the liabilities  assumed,   and   the policy of Section   351   would   be seriously   frustrated.  To   prevent this result, Congress   promptly   responded to Hendler   by enacting the statutory predecessor of Section 357. Section 357(a) now  provides that   the assumption of a liability$! by a transferee corporation  in a Section   351 exchange (and several   other transactions to be   studied later)   will neither. consti b nor   pr t e from qualifying under Section 351. Rather than treating the  debt relief as boot, the Code   postpones the recognition of any gain   attributable to the  transferred liabilities. This deferral is accomplished   by Section 358(d),  which reduces the basis in the stock received in the exchange   by treating  the  relieved liabilities as “money received” by the transferor for purposes  of determining the shareholder’s basis. Section 357 is subject to two   exceptions. The first (Section   357(b))  prevents   abuse   and the second (Section 357(c)) avoids   the   tax taboo of a negative basis (Under the Section   357(b) “tax avoidance” exception,   the  assumption of a liability is treated as boot if the taxpayer's   “principal purpose” in transferring the liability was the avoidance of federal income  taxes or was not a bona fide business   purpose) This   essentially   factual  determination is made after “taking into consideration the nature of the hability and the circumstances in the light of which the arrangement for  Crane v. Commissioner, 331   U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 1047 (1947).  60 303   U.S.   564,   58 S.Ct. 655 (1938).  subject to the liability. LR.C.   § 357(d)(1)(B). If  a nonrecourse liability   also   is secured   by  other assets   not   transferred to the   corporation,   the amount treated as assumed   must   be  reduced   by the   lesser   of the   portion   of  the   liability   that   the   owner of the   other   assets   has   agreed to and is expected to  satisfy,   or  the  fair market   value   of  those   other   assets.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  the   assumption   or   acquisition   was   made.”62   If   an   improper   purpose  exists,   all the relieved   liabilities, not merely   the evil debts,   are treated as  boot.68   Section   357(b)   was   designed   to   prevent   taxpayers   from  transferring   personal   obligations   to a newly   formed   corporation   or   from achieving   a “bail   out   without   boot”   by borrowing   against   property   on   the  eve   of incorporation   and   then   transferring   the   encumbered   asset   to the  corporation.   Perhaps   because   the   rule   is more   draconian   than   necessary,  it has   been   sparingly   applied.   Section   357(b)   is accompanied   by an   odd burden   of proof rule   providing   that   in “any   suit”   where   the taxpayer   has  the   burden   of proving   the   absence   of an   improper   purpose,   that   burden  shall   not   be   met   unless   the   taxpayer   “sustains   such   burden   by the   clear  preponderance   of the   evidence.”64 _ The   purpose of the second   exception is more technical. Section 357(c) provides that if the sum of the liabilities assumed by the corporation  exceed the aggregate adjusted bases of the properties transferred by a  particular transferor,®5   the   excess shall be considered as gain from the  sale or exchange of the property. According to the regulations, the  character of the Section 357(c) gain is determined   by allocating the gain  among the transferred assets in proportion to their respective fair market values.66 A simple illustration explains the need for Section   357 (c).  Assume our friend, A, forms   Venture, Inc. by transferring a building   with  an adjusted basis of $30, a  fair market value of $100   and an outstanding  mortgage of $55.   In exchange, Venture issues common stock with a value  of $45 and takes the building subject to the $55 mortgage. If Section  357(a)   applied, without more, A would recognize no gain on the exchange, but pause to consider his basis in the   stock under Section 358. It would  be $30 (the basis of the   building), less $55 (the liability, treated as boot  for basis purposes   under Section 358(d)), or   a minus $25. Although tax  scholars have   debated the issue, the Code abhors a negative basis.®7 Section 357(c) conveniently avoids that taboo by requiring A to recognize  $25   gain (the excess of the $55 liability over his $30   adjusted basis).   A’s  basis then becomes zero, and the Code is not further complicated   by the  mysteries of algebra.  Section 357(c) is  itself subject to an   exception. Under general tax  principles, a taxpayer who is relieved of a liability that would be  62 [R.C. § 357(b)(1).   In evaluating whether the business   purpose is bona fide, the  regulations   require both the transferor and the corporation to demonstrate a “corporate business reason” (emphasis   added) for the assumption of  the liabilities when they report a Section   351  transaction on   their income tax   returns.   Reg. § 1.351—3(a)(6), —3(b)(7).  63 Reg. § 1.357-1(c).  64 TR.C. § 357(b)(2).   This standard   adds little to the normal   burden of proof imposed in  tax   litigation and   has   largely been   ignored   by the  courts. 65 Section   357(c) is applied on a transferor-by-transferor basis.   Rev.   Rul. 66-142,   1966-1 O:B. 66.  66 Reg. § 1.357—2(b).   As the problems illustrate,   this approach can   be anomalous insofar as   it requires   an   allocation   of  gain (for characterization   purposes) to  an   asset   with   no   realized  ain.  ;   67   For   a contrary   view   on   the   viability   of a negative   basis,   see   Cooper,   “Negative   Basis,”  75 Harv.   L. Rev.   1352   (1962).  81

82 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  deductible if paid directly by the taxpayer does not recognize gain if the  debt is discharged   because any potential income   would be offset by a  corresponding deduction upon   payment.68 For example, a lender's discharge of a borrower’s   $1,000 interest expense on a home mortgage is economically equivalent to the   lender’s transfer of $1,000 cash to the  borrower (gross income) and a retransfer of $1,000   cash as interest by the borrower to the lender (offsetting deduction). Taken together,   these transactions   should not   result in any net income to the borrower.®9 In keeping with this approach, Section 357(c)(8) excludes from the term “liabilities,”   for purposes of determining the   excess of liabilities over basis, any obligation that would give rise to a deduction if it had   been  paid by the transferor’? or which   would be described in Section 736(a).71  These same types of obligations also   are not treated as “liabilities” for  purposes of determining the basis of the   stock received by the transferor under Section 358.72 The origin of this exception is best understood   by looking back to the difficulties encountered   by cash basis proprietors who incorporated a  going business prior to the enactment of Section 357(c)(3). Consider the  plight of Accountant (“A”),   a cash basis taxpayer whose sole proprietorship   consisted of the following assets and liabilities:  8 See   LR.C. § 108(e)(2), which provides that no income shall be realized from the  discharge of indebtedness to the   extent the payment of the liability would   have given rise   to a deduction.  69 Cf. L.R.C. § 7872. The example   assumes that   the   interest is deductible “qualified  residence interest” under Section 163(h).  70 Excepted from this exception are obligations which, when incurred,   resulted in the  creation of, or an increase in, the basis of any   property—e.g., obligations to pay for small tools  purchased on credit. I.R.C. § 357(c)(3)(B). To illustrate, assume cash method Proprietor (“P”)  buys   $100 of small tools on credit, promising to pay the seller   in two months. Pending payment  of the  obligation, P has a $100 basis in the tools (P’s cost). One   month later, P transfers the tools  and the   related   obligation to a new corporation in a Section   351   transaction. The obligation is appropriately treated as   a “liability”   for purposes of Section 357(c)—but not to worry   because the amount of that liability is offset by P’s basis in the transferred tools. In comparison, contingent liabilities that have not   yet given rise   to  a capital expenditure   (and   thus have not created or increased basis) are   not included in determining the amount of liabilities assumed   by  the  transferee. See   Rev. Rul. 95-74, infra, p. 103. . 71 Section   736(a)   applies to payments   made to a retiring partner or  to  a deceased partner’s successor in interest in liquidation of that   partner’s   interest in the partnership.   Section   736(a)  payments, like accounts   payable of a cash basis taxpayer,   have the effect   of reducing gross income when paid and   thus are appropriately   excluded   from “liabilities”   for purposes of Section 357(c) and 358(d).  @   ER.C. § 358(d)(2). But see LR.C. § 358(h), a specialized   anti-abuse rule, which   generally  stepped   down (but  not below fair market value)   by the amount of any liabilities   not   taken into  account  under Section   358(d) (e.g., “deductible” or contingent liabilities   that   do  not   result   in  a  basis  reduction)   and   assumed   by  another   person as  part  of  the  exchange.

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  Assets   Adj.   Basis   _F.M.V.  Cash   $100   $100  Accounts   receivable   0   200  Equipment   £250   250  $150   $550  Liabilities Accounts   payable   $400 Assume   A incorporates   his business   by transferring   all the   assets   to Newco   in exchange   for   $150   of Newco   stock   and   Newco’s   assumption   of the   $400   accounts   payable.   If the   payables   are   “liabilities”   for purposes  of   Section   357(c)(1),   A   recognizes   $250   gain—the   excess   of   the   $400  liabilities   assumed   by Newco   over   the   $150   aggregate   adjusted   basis   of  the   assets   transferred   to the corporation.   A’s adjusted   basis   in the Newco  stock   would   be zero.73  The   harshness of this result becomes apparent when it is compared  to an economically equivalent transaction. Suppose, for example, that A  had retained the payables,   transferred the $550 in assets to Newco in exchange for $150 of Newco stock and   $400 cash and then used the cash to pay his  creditors. Although A would recognize $400 gain under Section  351(b), that gain would be offset by the $400   deduction that A would receive on payment of the payables.   Alternatively, A could have   avoided any   gain simply by retaining sufficient   assets to pay the deductible  accounts   payable. As these examples illustrate, the   inclusion of accounts   payable as “liabilities”   for purposes of Section 357(c)   often caused cash basis  taxpayers to recognize more gain by   having their obligations assumed  than   they would have   recognized if they  received equivalent   cash boot or  withheld sufficient   assets to pay the liabilities. Several courts attempted  to cure this anomaly by excluding certain deductible liabilities from the  scope of Section 357(c), but the   cases lacked a uniform rationale.”4 To resolve   these ambiguities   and halt   the litigation, Congress amended  Sections 357(c) and 358(d) to provide that   deductible   obligations no  longer would be   considered “liabilities”   for these   limited   purposes.  Congress also indicated that this exception   was not intended to affect 73 A’s   basis is derived as follows: $150 (basis   in   assets transferred by   A) minus $400  (liabilities assumed   by  Newco, treated as “money received” for basis purposes)   plus $250 (gain  recognized   by A). LR.C. § 358(a)(1), (d)(1).  74 See   Focht v. Commissioner, 68   T.C. 223   (1977)   (“iability” under Sections   357(c) and 358(d)   limited to obligations   which, if transferred,   cause   gain   recognition under Crane case);  Thatcher v.

84  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  either   the   transferee   corporation’s   tax   treatment   of   the   excluded  liabilities   or   the   definition   of liabilities   for   any   other   provision   of the  Code,   including   Sections   357(a)   and   357(b).75  If all else fails, a transferor   can   avoid   recognizing   Section   357(c)   gain  simply   by contributing   additional   cash   to the   corporation   in an   amount  equal   to   the   excess   of assumed   liabilities   over   the   aggregate   adjusted  basis   of   the   other   contributed   assets.   A   more   intriguing   question   is  whether   a   cash   poor   transferor   can   eliminate   the   gain   by   remaining personally   hable   on   the assumed   debts   or by transferring   a personal   note to the   corporation   for the   Section   357(c)   excess.   The   courts   are   confused by   these   questions,   as   evidenced   by   the   Peracchi   case   and   the   Note  following.  Peracchi   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Ninth   Circuit,   1998.  143   F.3d   487.  ma KOZINSKI,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE:  We must unscramble a Rubik’s Cube of corporate tax law to determine the   basis of a note contributed by a taxpayer to his wholly-  owned corporation.  The   Transaction  The taxpayer, Donald Peracchi, needed to contribute   additional capital to his closely-held corporation (NAC) to comply with Nevada’s minimum premium-to-asset ratio for insurance   companies.   Peracchi contributed   two parcels of real estate. The parcels were encumbered with habilities which together exceeded Peracchi’s total basis in the properties by  more   than half a million dollars. As we discuss in detail below, under  section 357(c), contributing   property   with liabilities in excess of basis   can trigger immediate recognition of gain in the amount of the excess.   In an  effort   to avoid this, Peracchi also executed a promissory note, promising to pay NAC $1,060,000 over a term of ten years at 11% interest. Peracchi  maintains that   the   note has a basis equal to its face amount,   thereby making his  total basis in the property   contributed   greater than the total liabilities.   If this is so, he will have   extracted   himself  from the quicksand of  section   357(c) and   owe no immediate tax   on   the  transfer of property to NAC. The IRS,   though,   maintains that (1) the   note is not genuine  indebtedness   and   should   be treated as an unenforceable gift; and (2) even if the note is genuine, it does   not increase   Peracchi’s   basis   in the property contributed.  The parties   are   not   splitting   hairs: Peracchi   claims   the   basis   of  the  note   is  $1,060,000, its face  value,   while   the IRS   argues   that   the   note   has a basis   of  zero.   If Peracchi is  right, he pays   no immediate tax   on   the half %® Staff  of  Joint Committee on   Taxation,   General   Explanation of  the Revenue   Act  of  1978,  96th   Cong.,   1st   Sess. 219-220   (1979).

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  a   million dollars   by which   the   debts   on   the   land   he   contributed   exceed  his basis   in the   land;   if the   IRS   is right,   the   note   becomes   irrelevant   for  tax purposes   and   Peracchi   must   recognize   an   immediate   gain on   the half million.   The   fact that   the   IRS   and   Peracchi   are   so far apart   suggests   they  are   looking   at the   transaction   through   different   colored   lenses.   To   figure  out   whether   Peracchi’s   lens   is rose-tinted   or   clear,   it is useful   to take   a guided   tour   of   sections   351   and   357   and   the   tax   law   principles  undergirding   them.  Into   the   Lobster   Pot:   Section   3512  The   Code   tries to make   organizing   a corporation   pain-free   from   a tax  point   of view.   A   capital   contribution   is, in tax   lingo,   a   “nonrecognition”  event:   A   shareholder   can   generally   contribute   capital   without  recognizing   gain   on   the   exchange.   It’s   merely   a   change   in   the   form   of  ownership,   like   moving   a billfold   from   one   pocket   to another.   See   I.R.C. § 351.   So   long   as   the   shareholders   contributing   the   property   remain   in  control   of   the   corporation   after   the   exchange,   section   351   applies:   It  doesn’t   matter   if the   capital   contribution   occurs   at   the   creation   of the  corporation   or if—as   here—the   company   is already   up   and   running.   The baseline   is   that   Peracchi   may   contribute   property   to   NAC   without recognizing   gain on   the   exchange. Gain   Deferral:   Section   358(a) Peracchi   contributed capital to NAC in the form of real property and a promissory note. Corporations may be funded with   any   kind of  asset, such as equipment, real   estate, intellectual property, contracts,  leaseholds, securities or letters   of credit. The tax consequences can get a  little complicated   because a shareholder’s basis in the property  contributed often differs from its fair market value. The general rule is  that   an asset’s basis is equal to its “cost.” See I.R.C. § 1012. But when a shareholder like Peracchi contributes   property to   a corporation in a nonrecognition transaction, a cost basis   does   not preserve the  unrecognized gain. Rather than take a basis equal to the fair market value of the property   exchanged, the shareholder   must substitute   the  basis of that property for what   would otherwise be the cost basis of the stock. This   preserves the gain for recognition at  a later day: The gain 1s  built   into the shareholder’s new basis in the   stock, and he will recognize  income when he   disposes of  the stock.  The fact that   gain is deferred   rather   than   extinguished doesn’t  diminish the importance of questions   relating to basis and the timing of  recognition.   In tax,   as in comedy,   timing   matters. Most   taxpayers   would much prefer to pay tax   on contributed   property   years later—when they sell their stock—rather   than when they   contribute   the   property. Thus  (ane eS   ESS  2 “Decisions to embrace the   corporate   form of organization   should   be   carefully  considered,   since   a corporation is  like  a lobster   pot:  easy to  enter,   difficult  to live in, and painful to  get out of.” Boris I.

Nonrecognition   assumes   that   a capital contribution   amounts  to   nothing   more   than   a   nominal   change   in   the   form   of ownership;   in substance   the   shareholder’s   investment   in the property   continues.   But   a  capital   contribution   can   sometimes   allow   a   shareholder   to   partially terminate   his   investment   in   an   asset   or   group   of assets.   For   example,  when   a shareholder   receives   cash   or other   property   in addition   to stock, receipt   of that   property   reflects   a   partial   termination   of investment   in the   business.   The   shareholder   may   invest   that   money   in   a   wholly unrelated   business,   or   spend   it just   like   any   other   form   of   personal income.   To   the   extent   a   section   351   transaction   resembles   an   ordinary  sale, the   nonrecognition   rationale   falls apart.  Thus the central exception to nonrecognition for section 351 transactions comes into play when the taxpayer receives “boot”—money or property other than stock in the corporation—in   exchange for the property contributed.   See I.R.C. § 351(b). Boot is recognized as taxable  income because it represents a partial cashing out. It’s as if the taxpayer contributed part of the property to the corporation in exchange for stock, and sold part of the property for cash. Only the   part exchanged for stock  represents a continuation of investment; the  part sold for cash is properly  recognized as yielding income, just as if the taxpayer   had sold the property to  a third   party. Peracchi did   not receive   boot in return for the property   he  contributed. But that   doesn’t end the  inquiry: We must consider whether Peracchi   has cashed out in some other way   which   would   warrant treating part of the transaction as taxable boot.  Assumption of  Liabilities: Section   357(a) The property   Peracchi   contributed to NAC was encumbered by liabilities. Contribution of leveraged   property makes things trickier from a tax perspective. When a shareholder contributes   property encumbered  by debt,   the corporation   usually assumes the debt. And the Code  normally treats discharging a liability the same as receiving money:   The taxpayer   improves his economic position by the same amount either way. See I.R.C. § 61(a)(12). NAC’s   assumption of the liabilities attached to  Peracchi’s   property   therefore   could   theoretically   be viewed as the receipt of money,   which   would be taxable boot. See United States v. Hendler,   303  U.S.   564,   58 S.Ct.   655,   82  L.Ed.   1018 (1938).  The   Code   takes a different   tack. Requiring   shareholders like Peracchi to recognize   gain   any   time a corporation   assumes a hability   in  connection   with a capital   contribution   would   greatly   diminish   the  nonrecognition   benefit   section   351 is meant to  confer.   Section   357(a) thus  takes a   lenient   view   of   the   assumption of   liability: A   shareholder

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A CORPORATION  engaging   in   a   section   351   transaction   does   not   have   to   treat   the  assumption   of   liability   as   boot,   even   if the   corporation   assumes   his  obligation   to pay.   See   I.R.C.   § 357(a). This   nonrecognition   does   not   mean   that   the   potential   gain  disappears.   Once   again,   the basis   provisions   kick in to reflect   the transfer  of   gain   from   the   shareholder   to   the   corporation:   The   shareholder's  substitute   basis   in the   stock   received   is decreased   by the   amount   of the  liability   assumed   by   the   corporation.   See   I.R.C.   § 358(d),   (a).   The  adjustment   preserves   the   gain for recognition   when   the shareholder   sells  his   stock   in   the   company,   since   his   taxable   gain   will   be   the   difference  between   the   (new   lower)   basis   and   the   sale   price of the   stock.  Sasquatch and   The   Negative Basis Problem: Section 357(c)  Highly leveraged property   presents a peculiar problem in the  section 351 context. Suppose a shareholder organizes a corporation and  contributes as its only asset a building   with a basis of $50, a fair market  value of $100, and mortgage debt of $90. Section   351 says   that the shareholder does not recognize   any gain on the transaction. Under  section 351 the shareholder takes a substitute basis of $50 in the stock,  then adjusts it downward under section 357 by $90 to reflect the  assumption of liability. This leaves him with a basis of minus $40. A  negative basis properly   preserves the gain built   into the property: If the shareholder turns around and sells the   stock   the next day for $10 (the  difference between the fair market value and the debt), he would face $50  in gain, the same amount as  if he sold the property   without first encasing  it in a corporate shell.® But skeptics   say   that negative basis, like Bigfoot,   doesn’t exist.  Compare Easson v. Commissioner, 33   T.C.   963,   970, 1960 WL 1347 (1960) (there’s   no such   thing as   a negative basis) with Easson v. Commissioner, 294   F.2d 653, 657-58 (9th Cir.1961) (yes, Virginia,   there  is  a negative basis). Basis normally operates as   a cost recovery   system:  Depreciation   deductions   reduce basis, and when basis hits zero, the  property   cannot be depreciated farther. At a more basic level, it seems  incongruous to attribute a negative   value to   a figure   that normally  represents one’s investment in an asset. Some   commentators nevertheless   argue that when basis operates   merely to measure potential  gain (as it does here), allowing   negative basis may be   perfectly  appropriate   and consistent   with the  tax policy underlying   nonrecognition  transactions. See, e.g., J. Clifton Fleming, Jr., The   Highly   Avoidable  Section 357(c):   A Case   Study in Traps for the Unwary and Some Positive  “Thoughts   About   Negative Basis,   16 J. Corp. L.  1, 27-30 (1990). Whatever  the   merits   of  this debate, it seems that   section   357(c) was   enacted to  8 Ifthe  taxpayer sells the  property   outright,   his amount realized   includes   the full amount of  the   mortgage debt,   see Crane y. Commissioner,   331   U.S. 1,  14,  67   S.Ct.   1047,   91   L.Ed.   1301 (1947),   and   the   result   is as   follows: Amount realized   ($10   cash   +   $90   debt) — $50   Basis = $50  gain.  87

88   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   ;   PART   2  eliminate   the   possibility   of negative   basis.   See   George   Cooper,   Negative  Basis,   75 Harv.   L.Rev.   1352,   1360   (1962).  Section   357(c)   prevents   negative   basis   by forcing   a   shareholder   to recognize   gain to the extent   liabilities   exceed   basis.   Thus,   if a shareholder  contributes   a building   with   a basis   of $50   and   liabilities   of $90,   he   does  not   receive   stock   with   a basis   of minus   $40.   Instead,   he   takes   a basis   of  zero   and   must   recognize   a $40   gain.  Peracchi   sought   to contribute   two   parcels   of real property   to NAC   in a   section   351   transaction.   Standing   alone   the   contribution   would   have run   afoul   of section   357(c):   The   property   he   wanted   to   contribute   had liabilities   in excess   of basis,   and   Peracchi   would   have   had   to recognize  gain   to the   extent   of the   excess,   or   $566,807   * * *   ,10  The   Grift:   Boosting   Basis   with   a Promissory   Note  Peracchi tried to dig himself out   of this tax hole by contributing a  personal note with a face amount of $1,060,000   along   with the real  property. Peracchi maintains that the  note has a basis in his hands equal to its face value. If he’s   right, we must add the   basis of the   note to the  basis of the real property. Taken together,   the aggregate basis in the property   contributed would exceed the aggregate liabilities [including the note at face value,   the aggregate basis of the contributed   properties  would be $2,041,406 and   would exceed the $1,548,213 of aggregate  liabilities, Eds.].  Under Peracchi’s   theory,   then,   the aggregate liabilities no longer exceed the aggregate basis, and section   357(c) no longer triggers any  gain. The government argues, however, that   the   note has a zero   basis. If  so, the note would not affect the  tax consequences of the transaction, and  Peracchi’s $566,807 in gain would be  taxable immediately.  Are   Promises   Truly Free?  Which brings us (phew!) to the   issue   before us: Does Peracchi’s   note  have a basis in Peracchi’s hands for purposes of section   357(c)?12 The language of the Code gives us little to work with. The logical place to start is with the   definition   of  basis. Section   1012   provides that “[t]he basis   of  10 Peracchi remained personally liable on the debts encumbering the property   transferred  to NAC. NAC took   the property subject to the   debts, however,   which is enough to trigger gain under the plain language of section 357(c). See Owen v. Commissioner, 881   F.2d 832, 835-36  (9th  Cir.1989).  11 The government does not dispute that   the   note and the two   parcels of real estate were contributed as part of  the same transaction for purposes of section   351. Their   bases must therefore   be aggregated for purposes of  section 357(c).  12 Peracchi owned all the  voting   stock   of NAC both   before and after   the exchange, so the  control requirement of  section   351 is satisfied. Peracchi   received no boot   (such as cash or securities) which   would qualify as “money or other   property”   and trigger   recognition   under

CHAPTER   2   FORMATION   OF   A   CORPORATION  property   shall   be   the   cost   of such   property.   ...”   But   “cost”   is nowhere  defined.   What   does   it cost   Peracchi   to write   the   note   and   contribute   it to  his corporation?   The   IRS   argues   tersely that the “taxpayers   in the instant  case   incurred   no   cost   in issuing   their   own   note   to NAC,   so   their   basis   in  the note   was   zero.”   * *   * See Alderman   v. Commissioner,   55 T.C.   662,   665  (1971);   Rev.   Rul.   68-629,   1968-2   C.B.   154,   155.18   Building   on   this  premise,   the   IRS   makes   Peracchi   out   to   be   a   grifter:   He   holds   an  unenforceable   promise   to pay   himself   money,   since   the   corporation   will  not   collect   on   it unless   he   says   so. It’s true   that all Peracchi did was make out a promise to pay on a  piece of paper, mark it in the corporate minutes and enter it on the  corporate books. It is also true that nothing will cause the corporation to  enforce the   note against   Peracchi so long as Peracchi remains in  control. But the IRS ignores the possibility that NAC may go bankrupt, an event  that would   suddenly make the  note highly significant. Peracchi and NAC  are separated by the corporate form, and this gossamer curtain makes a difference in the shell game of C Corp   organization and reorganization. Contributing the note puts a million dollar nut within the corporate shell,  exposing Peracchi to the   cruel nutcracker of corporate creditors in the  event NAC goes bankrupt. And it does so to the tune of $1,060,000, the  full face amount of the note. Without the note,   no matter how deeply the corporation went into   debt, creditors could not reach Peracchi’s personal  assets. With the   note on the books, however, creditors   can reach into  Peracchi’s pocket by enforcing the   note as an unliquidated asset of the  corporation.  The   key to solving this puzzle,   then, is  to ask whether   bankruptcy is  significant enough a contingency to confer substantial economic effect on this transaction. If the risk   of bankruptcy is important   enough to be  recognized,   Peracchi   should get  basis in the note: He will have   increased  his exposure to the risks   of   the business—and thus his economic investment in NAC—by $1,060,000. If bankruptcy is  so remote that  there is no   realistic possibility it will ever   occur, we can   ignore the   potential  economic effect of  the   note as speculative and treat it as merely an  unenforceable   promise to contribute capital in the  future.  When the question is posed this way, the answer is clear. Peracchi’s  obligation on   the   note was not conditioned on NAC’s   remaining solvent. It represents a new   and substantial   increase in Peracchi’s investment in  the   corporation.14 The   Code   seems to recognize   that economic   exposure  ceils vile aie eat Ee eS  os 13 We would face a different   case had the Treasury   promulgated a regulation   interpreting  section 357(c). A revenue ruling is entitled to some   deference as the   stated litigating position of  the agency   which enforces   the  tax   code, but not   nearly as much as   a regulation. Ruling 68-629 offers   no   rationale, let alone a reasonable one,   for its holding   that it costs a taxpayer   nothing to  write a promissory note, and   thus   deserves little weight.  14. We confine   our   holding to   a case   such as   this where the   note is contributed to an  operating   business   which is subject to a non-trivial   risk of bankruptcy or receivership. NAC is not,   for example, a  shell   corporation or   a passive   investment   company;   Peracchi   got  into   this  mess   in  the   first place   because   NAC was   in  financial   trouble   and  needed   more   assets   to meet  Nevada’s   minimum   premium-to-asset   ratio   for  insurance   companies.  89

90   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  of   the   shareholder   is   the   ultimate   measuring   rod   of   a   shareholder’s  investment.   Cf.   I.R.C.   § 465   (at-risk   rules   for partnership   investments). Peracchi   therefore   is entitled   to a step-up   in basis   to the   extent   he will be subjected   to   economic   loss   if   the   underlying   investment   turns unprofitable.   Cf.   HGA   Cinema   Trust   v.   Commissioner,   950   F.2d   1357 ‘  1363   (7th   Cir.1991)   (examining   effect   of   bankruptcy   to   determine whether   long-term   note   contributed   by   partner   could   be   included   in  basis).   See   also Treas.   Reg.   § 1.704—1(b)(2)(ai)(c)(1)   (recognizing   economic  effect of promissory   note   contributed   by partner   for purposes   of partner’s  obligation   to restore   deficit   capital   account).  The   economics   of the   transaction   also   support   Peracchi’s   view   of the matter.   The   transaction   here   does   not   differ   substantively   from   others that would   certainly   give Peracchi   a boost   in basis.   For example,   Peracchi  could   have   borrowed   $1 million   from   a bank   and   contributed   the   cash   to NAC   along   with   the   properties.   Because   cash   has   a basis   equal   to face value,   Peracchi   would   not   have   faced   any   section   357(c)   gain.   NAC   could then   have   purchased   the   note   from   the   bank   for   $1   million   which, assuming   the   bank’s   original   assessment   of Peracchi’s   creditworthiness  was   accurate,   would   be the   fair   market   value   of the   note.   In the   end   the  corporation   would   hold   a million   dollar   note   from   Peracchi—just   like   it  does   now—and   Peracchi   would   face   no   section   357(c)   gain.15   The   only  economic   difference   between   the   transaction   just   described   and   the  transaction   Peracchi   actually   engaged   in   is   the   additional   costs   that  would   accompany   getting   a loan   from   the   bank.   Peracchi   incurs   a “cost” of $1 million   when   he   promises   to pay   the   note   to the   bank;   the   cost   is  not   diminished   here   by the   fact   that   the   transferor   controls   the   initial transferee.   The   experts   seem   to agree:   “Section   357(c)   can   be   avoided   by  a transfer   of enough   cash   to eliminate   any   excess   of liabilities   over   basis;  and   since   a   note   given   by   a   solvent   obligor   in   purchasing   property   is  routinely   treated   as the equivalent   of cash   in determining   the basis   of the  property,   it   seems   reasonable   to   give   it   the   same   treatment   in  determining   the   basis   of the   property   transferred   in a s 351   exchange.”  Bittker   &   Kustice   § 3.06[4][b].  6 In a similar vein, Peracchi could have first swapped promissory notes with a third party. Assuming the bona fides of each note, Peracchi would take a cost basis in the   third party  note equal to the   face value of the   note he   gave up. Peracchi could then   contribute the   third party   note to NAC, and   (thanks to the added basis) avoid any section   357(c)   gain. NAC could ‘then   close the circle by giving   the   third party note back to the   third   party in exchange for  Peracchi’s note, leaving   Peracchi   and NAC in exactly   the same position they   occupy now. The  IRS might attack   these maneuvers as step transactions,   but   that would   beg the   question: Does  the contribution of a shareholder’s note to his wholly-owned corporation   have   any real economic

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION   91  We   are   aware   of the   mischief   that   can   result   when   taxpayers   are  permitted   to calculate   basis   in excess   of their   true   economic   investment. See   Commissioner   v. Tufts,   461   U.S.   300,   103   S.Ct.   1826,   75 L.Ed.2d   863 (1983).   For   two   reasons,   however,   we   do not believe   our   holding   will have  such   pernicious   effects.   First,   and   most   significantly,   by increasing   the  taxpayer’s   personal   exposure,   the   contribution   of a valid,   unconditional  promissory   note   has   substantial   economic   effects   which   reflect   his   true  economic   investment   in   the   enterprise.   The   main   problem   with attributing   basis   to   nonrecourse   debt   financing   is that   the   tax   benefits  enjoyed   as   a   result   of increased   basis   do   not   reflect   the   true   economic  risk. Here   Peracchi   will have   to pay the full amount   of the note   with   after- tax   dollars   if NAC’s   economic   situation   heads   south.   Second,   the   tax treatment   of   nonrecourse   debt   primarily   creates   problems   in   the partnership   context,   where   the   entity’s   loss   deductions   (resulting   from depreciation   based   on basis inflated   above   and beyond   the taxpayer’s   true economic   investment)   can   be   passed   through   to   the   taxpayer.   It is the pass-through   of losses   that   makes   artificial   increases   in equity   interests  of particular   concern.   See,   e.g.,   Levy   v.   Commissioner,   732   F.2d   1435,  1437   (9th Cir.1984).   We   don’t   have   to tread   quite   so lightly in the   C Corp  context,   since   a C Corp   doesn’t   funnel   losses   to the   shareholder.16  We   find   further   support   for   Peracchi’s   view   by   looking   at   the  alternative:   What   would   happen   if the   note   had   a   zero   basis?   The   IRS points   out   that   the basis   of the note   in the hands   of the corporation   is the same   as   it was   in the   hands   of the   taxpayer.   Accordingly,   if the   note   has a zero   basis   for Peracchi,   so too   for NAC.   See   I.R.C.   § 362(a).17   But   what  happens   if NAC—perhaps   facing the threat   of an   involuntary   petition for  bankruptcy—turns   around   and   sells   Peracchi’s   note   to a third   party   for  its fair   market   value?   According   to the   IRS’s   theory,   NAC   would   take   a  carryover   basis   of zero   in the note   and would   have   to recognize   $1,060,000 in phantom   gain   on   the   subsequent   exchange,   even   though   the   note   did not   appreciate   in value   one   bit. That   can’t be the   right result. Accordingly,   we hold   that Peracchi   has a basis of $1,060,000 in the  note he   wrote to NAC. The   aggregate basis exceeds the liabilities of the  properties   transferred to NAC under section   351, and   Peracchi   need not  recognize   any section   357(c)   gain.  16 Our holding therefore   does not extend to the partnership or S  Corp context.  17 But see Lessinger v. Commissioner, 872   F.2d   519   (2d   Cir.1989).   In Lessinger, the  Second Circuit analyzed a similar   transaction. It agreed   with the  IRS’s (faulty) premise that the  note had a zero   basis in  the taxpayer's   hands.   But then, brushing aside   the language of  section  -862(a),   the court concluded that  the note had a basis in the  corporation’s hands equal to its face  value. The court   held   that this was enough to dispel any section   357(c) gain to the taxpayer, proving that  two wrongs   sometimes do  add   up to  a right. We agree with the IRS that  Lessinger’s approach is untenable.   Section   357(c) contemplates   measuring basis   of the  property  contributed in  the hands of the   taxpayer,   not   the   corporation.   Section   357   appears in the midst of  the Code  sections   dealing   with   the effect   of  capital   contributions on   the   shareholder;   sections   361 et  seq., on   the   other   hand,   deal   with   the effect   on a corporation,   and section   362   defines   the   basis   of  property   contributed in  the hands of  the   corporation.   Because   we   hold   that   the   note   has a  face  value   basis   to  the  shareholder for purposes of  section   357(c), however,   we   reach   the   same result  as   Lessinger.

92   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Genuine   Indebtedness   or   Sham?  The   Tax   Court   never   reached   the issue of Peracchi’s   basis   in the note. Instead,   it ruled   for the   Commissioner   on   the ground   that   the   note   is not  genuine   indebtedness.   The   court   emphasized   two   facts   which   it believed  supported   the   view   that   the   note   is a sham:   (1) NAC’s   decision   whether  to collect   on   the   note   is wholly   controlled   by Peracchi   and   (2) Peracchi  missed   the   first   two   years   of payments,   yet NAC   did   not   accelerate   the  debt.   These   facts   certainly   do   suggest   that   Peracchi   paid   imperfect  attention   to his obligations   under   the   note,   as   frequently   happens   when  debtor   and   creditor   are   under   common   control.   But   we   believe   the proper  way   to approach   the   genuine   indebtedness   question   is to look   at the   face of the   note   and   consider   whether   Peracchi’s   legal   obligation   is illusory.  And   it is   not.   First,   the   note’s   bona   fides   are   adequate:   The   IRS   has  stipulated   that   Peracchi   is creditworthy   and   likely   to have   the   funds   to  pay the note; the note bears   a market   rate of interest   commensurate   with  his creditworthiness;   the   note   has   a fixed   term.   Second,   the   IRS   does   not  argue   that   the   value   of the   note   is anything   other   than   its   face   value; nothing   in the   record   suggests   NAC   couldn’t   borrow   against   the   note   to  raise   cash.   Lastly,   the   note   is fully transferable   and   enforceable   by third parties,   such   as hostile   creditors.   On   the basis   of these   facts   we   hold   that the   note   is an   ordinary,   negotiable,   recourse   obligation   which   must   be  treated   as   genuine   debt   for tax   purposes.   See   Sacks   v.   Commissioner,   69  F.3d   982,   989   (9th Cir.1995).  The   IRS argues that   the   note is nevertheless a sham because it was executed   simply to avoid tax. Tax   avoidance is  a valid concern in   this context;   section 357(a)   does provide the opportunity for a bailout transaction of sorts. For example, a taxpayer with an unencumbered building   he wants to sell could   take out a nonrecourse   mortgage,   pocket the proceeds, and contribute the property to   a newly   organized  corporation. Although the gain would be preserved for later recognition, the taxpayer   would   have partially cashed out  his economic   investment in the  property: By taking out a nonrecourse   mortgage, the economic risk of loss would be transferred to the lender. Section   357(b) addresses this sort of bailout by requiring the recognition of gain if the transaction lacks a  business   purpose.  Peracchi’s   capital contribution is not a bailout. Peracchi   contributed  the buildings to NAC because the company needed additional capital,  and the contribution of  the  note was part of  that  transaction. The IRS, in  fact, stipulated   that   the contribution   had a business   purpose.   Bailout  potential exists regardless of whether the taxpayer   contributes a note  along   with   the   property;   section   357(b),   not   357(c), is the sword the Service must use to attack   bailout   transactions. Is the note a gift?  The   IRS also   offers   a more   refined   version   of  the sham   transaction  argument:   The   note   was   really   a gift to NAC because   Peracchi   did   not recelve   any   consideration   from   the   exchange.   The   IRS   admits   that   the

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION  tax deferral resulting from   avoiding section   357(c) gain is a benefit to  Peracchi. It argues, nonetheless, that this is not enough to make the  bargain enforceable because it works no detriment to NAC. This  argument would classify all contributions of capital as gifts. A  corporation never gives up anything explicitly when it accepts a capital  contribution.   Instead, the corporation implicitly promises to put the  money to good use, and its directors and officers undertake the fiduciary duty to generate the highest possible return on the investment. The contribution of the   note was no more a gift than the contribution of $1 million in cash to the corporation would have been; it does not reflect the “detached   and disinterested   generosity” which characterizes a gift for  purposes of federal income taxation. See Commissioner v. Duberstein,  363 U.S. 278,   285, 80 S.Ct. 1190,   4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960).  The   Aftermath  We   take   a final   look   at the   result   to make   sure   we   have   not   placed our   stamp   of approval   on   some   sort   of exotic   tax   shelter.   We   hold   that  Peracchi   is entitled   to   a   step   up   in basis   for the   face   value   of the   note, just   as   if he   contributed   cash   to   the   corporation.   See   I.R.C.   § 358.   If  Peracchi   does   in fact keep   his promise   and   pay   off the note   with   after tax dollars,   the   tax   result   is perfectly   appropriate:   NAC   receives   cash,   and  the   increase   in   basis   Peracchi   took   for   the   original   contribution   is  justified.   Peracchi   has   less   potential   gain,   but   he   paid   for   it in   real dollars.  But   what   if, as   the   IRS   fears,   NAC   never   does   enforce   the   note?   If NAC   goes   bankrupt,   the   note   will   be   an   asset   of the   estate   enforceable for the benefit   of creditors,   and   Peracchi   will   eventually   be forced   to pay  in after   tax   dollars.   Peracchi   will   undoubtedly   have   worked   the   deferral  mechanism   of section   351   to his   advantage,   but   this   is not   inappropriate where   the taxpayer   is on   the hook   in both   form   and   substance   for enough  cash   to   offset   the   excess   of   liabilities   over   basis.   By   increasing   his personal   exposure   to   the   creditors   of NAC,   Peracchi   has   increased   his  economic   investment   in the   corporation,   and   a corresponding   increase   in  basis   is wholly   justified.?°  Conclusion  We hold   that Peracchi   has a basis   of $1,060,000 in the note, its face  value. As such,   the aggregate liabilities of  the property   contributed to NAC do not exceed its basis, and   Peracchi does   not recognize   any § 357(c)  gain. The decision of  the Tax   Court is REVERSED. The case is remanded  for entry of judgment in  favor   of Peracchi.  20 What   happens if NAC does   not   go bankrupt,   but   merely writes off the   note   instead?  Peracchi   would   then face discharge of indebtedness   income to the  tune of $1,060,000.   This would put   Peracchi in   a worse   position   than when he   started,   since discharge of  indebtedness is normally   treated as ordinary   income.   Peracchi,   having   increased   his  basis in  the   stock   of  the  corporation   by  $1,060,000   would receive a capital   loss   (or  less   capital   gain) to that   extent. But the   shift   in  character   of the   income will normally   work to   the   disadvantage of  a taxpayer in  Peracchi’s   situation.  93

94 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  a FERNANDEZ,   CIRCUIT JUDGE,   Dissenting:  Is there something that a taxpayer, who has borrowed   hundreds of  thousands of dollars more than his basis in  his property, can   do to avoid taxation when he transfers the property? Yes,   says Peracchi, because by using a very clever argument he can avoid the   strictures of 26   U.S.C. § 357(c). He need only make a promise to pay by giving a “good,” though unsecured, promissory note to his corporation when he transfers the  property to it. That is true even though the property remains subject to  the encumbrances. How can   that   be?   Well, by preparing a promissory note   the taxpayer   simply creates basis without cost to himself. * * * Thus he can   extract a large  part of the value of the property, pocket the funds, use them, divest himself of the property, and pay the tax another day, if ever at all.  But   as with   all magical   solutions,   the taxpayer   must   know   the proper incantations   and   make   the   correct   movements.   He   cannot   just   transfer  the   property   to the   corporation   and   promise,   or   be   obligated,   to pay   off  the encumbrances.   That   would   not   change   the fact that   the property   was  still   subject   to   those   encumbrances.   According   to   Peracchi,   the thaumaturgy   that will save   him   from   taxes   proceeds   in two   simple   steps. He   must   first   prepare   a   ritualistic   writing—an   unsecured   promissory  note   in an   amount   equal   to or   more   than   the   excess   of the   encumbrances  over   the basis.   He   must   then   give that   writing   to his corporation.   That   is all.1 But is not that just a “promise   to pay,” which   “does   not represent   the paying   out or reduction   of assets?”   Don   E. Williams   Co. v. Commissioner,  429   U.S.   569,   583,   97   S.Ct.   850,   858,   51 L.Ed.2d   48   (1977).   Never   mind,  he   says.   He   has   nonetheless   increased   the   total   basis   of the   property  transferred   and   avoided   the tax.   I understand   the temptation   to embrace  that   argument,   but I see   no   real   support   for it in the   law. Peracchi says a  lot about economic realities. I see nothing real about that maneuver. I see, rather, a bit of sortilege   that would   have made Merlin envious. The   taxpayer has   created something—basis—out of  nothing.  Thus,   I respectfully   dissent.  NOTE  An Alternative   Rationale. As   noted in Judge Kozinski’s   opinion in  Peracchi,   the Second Circuit reached a similar   result   in Lessinger v.  Commissioner,” but its rationale was different. The   Second Circuit  concluded that a shareholder’s basis   in his own note equals its face amount because,  necessarily,   the  note’s  basis to the corporation   was face  value. While  it may lead to an   equitable result, this backwards   reasoning is not supported  ee   EL  1 What is even better, he   need not   even make   payments on   the   note   until   after   the IRS  catches   up  with  him. I, by the  way,   am   dubious   about   the  proposition   that the Tax   Court   clearly  erred when it held   that   the   note   was   not   even a genuine   indebtedness. ©   872   F.2d   519   (2d Cir.1989).

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF   A CORPORATION   95  by the Code. The following   excerpt from a commentary on Lessinger  illustrates the court’s faulty logic:77 Before   turning   to   the   court’s   application   of Section   357(c)   to  the note—a   genuinely   intriguing   question—one   should   clear the air about   the   general   question   of the   basis   on   which   Section   357(c) must   be   focusing.   To   say   that   this   is the   corporation’s   basis   in the  transferred   assets   is preposterous.   If nothing   else,   such   a reading will in many   cases   be circular.   Section   362(a)   gives   the corporation  a   carryover   basis   in   the   assets   received   from   the   shareholder,  increased   by   any   gain   recognized   by   the   shareholder   on   the exchange.   The   classic   instance   of recognized   gain on   a Section   351  exchange   is   under   Section   357(c);   thus,   one   cannot   determine   a corporation’s   basis   in   its   assets   without   first   determining   the shareholder’s   gain   under   Section   357(c).   To   declare,   as   the   Second  Circuit   did,   that   the   amount   of the   gain   generally   turns   on   the  corporation’s   basis   in its assets   leads   to an   endless   circle.  To   illustrate,   assume   a shareholder   transfers   to a corporation, Blackacre,   in which   the   shareholder   has a basis   of $30,000,   subject  to   a   mortgage   of   $40,000.   To   determine   the   gain   under   Section 357(c)   under   the   appellate   decision   in Lessinger,   one   would   have   to  first determine   the   corporation’s   basis   under   Section   362(a).   Under  the   latter   section,   however,   the   corporation’s   basis   must   reflect   the  gain   under   Section   357(c),   and   thus,   one   must   compute   the  shareholder’s   gain   in   order   to   determine   the   corporation’s   basis.  Perhaps   the   court   meant   that   one   should   determine   the  corporation’s   basis   without   regard   to   the   debt,   or   that   Section  357(c)   looks   at different   bases   depending   on   whether   a shareholder  note   or hard   assets   are   being   transferred,   but   these   are   even   more  thoroughly   incredible   stretches   of the   Code   language.  Perhaps the Second Circuit was trying to say   that Mr. Lessinger   should receive   “basis   credit” for his own note because of  his future   obligation to transfer   cash to the corporation or   its creditors. In   other   contexts, a  taxpayer’s   acceptance of even a nonrecourse liability on the   acquisition of property gives rise to a cost basis   that includes the amount of the   future  obligation.78 If Mr.   Lessinger’s liability were   genuine   and enforceable by the corporation’s creditors, as the   court concluded,   he arguably is   as much  entitled to basis credit as   is the purchaser of property   financed   with nonrecourse debt.  Effect of   Shareholder’s   Continuing   Personal Liability. The courts  historically have   been less sympathetic on a closely   related   question: whether a shareholder’s   continuing   personal liability  on   debts   transferred to  a corporation in a Section   351   transaction   causes   those   debts to be  excluded  77 Bogdanski,   “Shareholder Debt,   Corporate Debt: Lessons   from Leavitt and   Lessinger,”  16 J. Corp.   Tax’n 348, 352-53 (1990).

96  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  for purposes of Section 357(c). The   Tax Court has   consistently rejected the notion that transferred liabilities are excluded   from the Section 357(c) arithmetic if the transferring shareholder remains personally liable for the  debt.79 The   Ninth Circuit once appeared to disagree but later had a change  of heart.   In Jackson v. Commissioner,®° that   court held   that Section 357(c) did  not apply on an incorporation of a partnership where the taxpayer's   share of the partnership’s liabilities exceeded his adjusted basis in the transferred partnership interest but the taxpayer remained personally liable on the  debts. On these facts, the   court reasoned that   the corporation had not assumed any liabilities and thus the taxpayer did not have   any Section 357(c)  gain. This result was criticized by courts and commentators,*! but it is  consistent   with the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Lessinger that taxpayers enjoy no economic benefit (and thus no taxable gain) for the excess of transferred liabilities over   basis when they retain genuine personal liability on the debts.   In a jater case, the Ninth Circuit upheld the Tax Court’s finding  of Section 357(c) gain on a transfer of encumbered equipment to a controlled corporation where the liabilities exceeded the taxpayer’s basis even though the transferor had guaranteed the liabilities and remained personally liable  following the   transfer.82 Although the   court purported to distinguish its  earlier Jackson holding as not involving property subject to debt, the two decisions are difficult to reconcile.  In a later   case,®8   the   taxpayers,   in connection   with   the   incorporation   of their   family   farming   business,   contributed   assets   subject   to liabilities   that  exceeded   the   aggregate   adjusted   basis   of   the   transferred   assets.   The  taxpayers   remained   liable   as   guarantors   on   the   debts.   The   Seventh   Circuit,  affirming   the   Tax   Court,   held   that   the   taxpayers   recognized   Section   357(c)  gain on the incorporation   and, in so holding,   followed   the line of cases   strictly  interpreting   the   statute.   Citing   Peracchi   and   Lessinger,   the   taxpayers  contended   that   a   strict   reading   of Section   357(c)   was   based   on   “outdated precedent”   and   urged   the   court   to   exercise   its   equitable   power   to   craft   a judicial   exception   to the   plain   language   of the   statute.   Both   the   Tax   Court  and   Seventh   Circuit   declined   the   invitation   to do   so   and   distinguished   the  pro-taxpayer   cases   on   the ground   that   personal   guaranties   of corporate   debt  are   not   the   same   as   incurring   debt   to the   corporation.   The   court   reasoned  that   a guaranty   is not   an   economic   outlay but   merely   a promise   to pay   in the future   if certain   events   should   occur.  y  6   ee. ee Smith v.

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION The uneasy relationship between owner debt, entity debt and basis is  raised in many settings.   Similar conceptual questions will resurface   with  varying results in other contexts   involving C and S corporations.*4  Determination   of Amount   of Liability Assumed.   Section   357(d)   attempts to clarify   the   amount   and   effect   of liability   assumptions   under   Section   357  and   several   other   provisions   covered   later   in the   text.   A recourse   liability   is  treated   as   having   been   “assumed”   if,   based   on   all   the   facts   and  circumstances,   the   transferee   has   agreed   to   and   is expected   to   satisfy   the  hability,   whether   or not   the transferor   has   been   relieved   of it.85 Nonrecourse  liabilities   generally   are   treated   as having   been   assumed   by a transferee   who takes   an   asset   subject   to the   liability,   except   the   amount   is reduced   by the  lesser   of: (1) the   amount   of such   liability   which   an   owner   of other   assets   not  transferred   to   the   transferee   and   also   subject   to   such   liability   has   agreed with   the transferee   to, and   is expected   to, satisfy,   or (2) the fair market   value  of those   other   assets.8*   The   purpose   of this convoluted   exception   is to prevent  double   counting   the   same   liability   for basis   adjustment   purposes.  Section   357(d)   was   enacted   to   eliminate   a   corporate   tax   shelter   that  exploited   ambiguities   in the interpretation   of the phrase   “transferred   subject to   a   liability”   in   an   earlier   version   of   Section   357.87   Most   of the   abusive  transactions   were   used   by   domestic   corporations   to   overstate   the   basis   of  encumbered   assets   received   in   transfers   from   foreign   affiliates   that   were indifferent   to   any   potential   Section   357(c)   gain   triggered   by   the   transfer because   they were   not   subject to U.S.   tax.   If the plan succeeded,   the domestic corporation   would   benefit   from   excessive   depreciation   deductions,   tax losses,  or reduced   gain on a future   sale   of the   asset.*8  Fortunately,   the   confusing   language   in   Section   357(d)   rarely   affects most   simple   incorporations.   But   it raises   some   questions   (and offers planning  opportunities)   that could   arise   in a purely   domestic,   non-abusive   setting.   For example,   recourse   debt   is   treated   as   assumed   only   if the   transferee   has  agreed   and   is expected   to satisfy it. As one   commentator   has asked,   “expected  by   whom’—the   transferee,   the   transferor,   or   both?89   Without   such   an  agreement   and   expectation,   a liability   would   not   be   treated   as   “assumed,”  perhaps   eliminating   a   Section   357(c)   problem   that   otherwise   might   have  84 See, e.g., Section   3B, infra (treatment of shareholder guaranteed debt for purposes of characterizing debt and equity in C corporation’s capital   structure); Chapter 15D, infra  (treatment of shareholder debt and   S   corporation debt guaranteed   by shareholders in determining basis   of S corporation stock under Section 1366); I.R.C. § 752 (allocation   of  liabilities   in determining partner’s basis in partnership interest and for other   purposes).  85 J.R.C. § 357(d)(1)(A). Where more   than one person   agrees to satisfy a liability, only one  of them   would be  “expected” to satisfy it.  86 T.R.C. § 357(d)(2). See also   I.R.C. § 362(d), which limits   the   basis   of property in the hands of the  transferee to effectuate a similar   policy against   double   counting. 87 See Staff  of Joint Committee on Taxation,   Deseription of Revenue Provisions Contained  in   the   President’s   Fiscal Year   2000   Budget   Proposal 197, JCS—1-99, 106th   Cong., 1st Sess.

98 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  existed. A similar   factual inquiry may be required with nonrecourse debt, which generally is treated as “assumed” unless a third party   has pledged  other assets as collateral and “has agreed to, and is expected to, satisfy” the obligation.  As   for   planning,   it has   been   suggested   that   Section   357(c)   problems could   be avoided,   at least with   respect   to recourse   debt,   if a shareholder   who  transfers   encumbered   property   to   a   controlled   corporation   enters   into   an  agreement   with   the   corporation   providing   that   the   shareholder   will   satisfy  the   debt.   In   that   event,   the   debt   would   not   be   treated   as   “assumed”   under  Section   357(d)   , and   neither   Section   357(a)   nor   Section   357(c)   would   apply   to  the   transfer.%   This   strategy   would   be   an   alternative   to contributing   a note  to the corporation   in the amount   of the potential   Section   357(c)   gain.  PROBLEMS  1.

INCORPORATION   OF   A GOING   BUSINESS  The   preceding   sections   were   designed   to   illustrate   the   basic  requirements   and   exceptions   for   qualifying   as   a   tax-free   incorporation.  For   pedagogical   reasons,   the   problems   have   involved   relatively   isolated  fact patterns,   and   it has been   assumed   that the Code   and regulations   will provide   an   answer   to virtually   every   question.   When   a going   business   is incorporated,   however,   matters   may   become   more   complex.   The   mix   of  assets   transferred   by   a   sole   proprietorship   or   partnership   may   include  “ordinary   income”   property,   such   as   accounts   receivable   and   inventory,  and   the corporation   may   assume   accounts   payable,   contingent   liabilities, and   supplies   the cost of which   was   deducted   by the transferor   prior to the  incorporation.   Questions   arise   as   to   the   proper   taxpayer   to   report   the  receivables   and   to   deduct   the   payables.   In   addition,   these   items potentially   raise   a   broad   issue   that   will   recur   throughout   our   study   of Subchapter   C:   to   what   extent   must   a   nonrecognition   provision   yield   to judicially   created   “common   law”   principles   of taxation   or to more   general  provisions   of the   Code? This section examines the   special problems raised by midstream  transfers   and, in so doing, provides an opportunity to review some concepts   introduced earlier in the chapter.  Hempt Brothers, Inc. v. United States  United States Court of Appeals,   Third Circuit, 1974.  490 F.2d 1172, cert. denied   419 U.S.   826,   95 S.Ct. 44 (1974).  ws ALDISERT,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE.  [A   cash method partnership   transferred all   its assets, including  $662,820 in  zero   basis accounts receivable, to a newly   formed corporation  in exchange for all the   corporation’s stock. Because the exchange qualified under Section 351, the  Service contended that the partnership’s  zero   basis   in  the  receivables   carried   over to the corporation   under Section  362,   causing the corporation to realize income   upon their   collection.   In  an odd   reversal of  roles, because the   statute   of limitations had run   on  earlier   years,   the   corporation   contended that   the   receivables   were not  “property”   within   the meaning of  Section   351   and that   their   transfer to the   corporation   was   an assignment of income   by the   partnership, subjecting   the   partners to  tax when the   receivables   were   transferred or  collected   and   providing   the   corporation   with a   cost (i.e., fair market  value)   basis   and   no   income   upon   collection.

100  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  to address   the   relationship   between   Section   351   and   the   assignment   of  income   doctrine.]  I.  Taxpayer   argues   here,   as it did in the district   court,   that because   the term   “property”   as   used   in   Section   351   does   not   embrace   accounts receivable,   the   Commissioner   lacked   statutory   authority   to   apply principles   associated   with   Section   351.   The   district   court   properly  rejected   the   legal interpretation   urged   by the   taxpayer.  The   definition   of Section   351   “property”   has been   extensively   treated by the   Court   of Claims   in   E.I.   Du   Pont   de   Nemours   and   Co.   v.   United States,   471   F.2d   1211,   1218-1219   (Ct.Cl.1973),   describing   the transfer   of  a   non-exclusive   license   to   make,   use   and   sell   area   herbicides   under  French   patents:  Unless   there   is some   special   reason   intrinsic   to   * * *   [Section  351]   * * * the   general   word   “property”   has   a broad   reach   in tax  law.   * * *   For   section   351,   in particular,   courts   have   advocated  a   generous   definition   of   “property,”   ***   and   it   has   been suggested   in one   capital   gains   case   that   nonexclusive   licenses  can   be viewed   as   property   though   not   as   capital   assets.   * * *  We see no adequate reason for refusing to follow these leads. We fail to perceive   any special reason why a restrictive meaning should be  applied to accounts receivables so as   to exclude them from the general meaning of “property.” Receivables possess the usual capabilities and attributes associated   with   jurisprudential   concepts of property law. They   may be identified, valued, and transferred. Moreover, their role   in an ongoing   business must be viewed in the context of Section   351 application. The presence of accounts   receivable is  a normal,   rather than an exceptional accoutrement of the type of business   included by  Congress  in the transfer to a corporate form. They are “commonly thought of  in the  commercial world as   a positive business asset.” As aptly put by the  district   court: “There is   a compelling   reason to construe ‘property’ to include * *  * [accounts receivable]: a new corporation   needs working  capital, and   accounts   receivable   can   be an important source of  liquidity.” Hempt Bros., Inc. v. United States,   supra, at 1176.   In any event, this  court had no  difficulty in characterizing a sale of receivables as “property” within   the purview of the   “no   gain or loss” provisionof   Section   337 as   a “qualified   sale   of property   within a 12-month period.”   Citizens’  Acceptance Corp. v. United States,   462   F.2d   751, 756   (3d Cir.1972).  The   taxpayer next makes a strenuous argument that   “(t]he  government 1s seeking to tax   the wrong person.”4 It contends   that   the  ee eee ee  4 We put  aside   the pragmatic   consideration   that the  transferee-corporate   taxpayer raises  the argument that   the   partnership   should   be taxed at  a time when the   statute   of  limitations  has   presumably run   against   the  transferor   partners,   who   ostensibly   are   the   stockholders   of  the  new   corporation.

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION  assignment of income doctrine as developed by the Supreme Court  applies to a Section   351   transfer of accounts receivable so that   the  transferor, not the transferee-corporation, bears the corresponding tax  hability. It argues that   the assignment of income doctrine dictates   that  where the   right to receive income is transferred to another person in a transaction not giving rise to tax at the time of transfer,   the transferor is  taxed on the income when it is collected by the transferee; that   the only  requirement for its application is  a transfer of a right to receive ordinary income; and that since the transferred   accounts receivable are a present  right to future income, the sole requirement for the application of the  doctrine is squarely met.   In   essence, this is   a contention that the  nonrecognition provision of Section   351 is in conflict with the assignment  of income doctrine and that Section   351 should be subordinated thereto.  Taxpayer relies on the seminal case of Lucas v. Earl, 280 U.S. 538,   50  S.Ct. 16, 74 L.Ed.   600 (1929), and its progeny for support of its  proposition that   the application of the doctrine is mandated whenever one transfers a right to receive ordinary income.  On   its part,   the   government   concedes   that   a   taxpayer   may   sell   for  value   a claim   to income   otherwise   his   own   and   he   will   be   taxable   upon  the proceeds   of the sale.   Such   was   the case   in Commissioner   v. P.G.   Lake,  Inc.,   356   U.S.   260,   78   S.Ct.   691,   2   L.Ed.2d   743   (1958),   in   which   the  taxpayer-corporation   assigned   its   oil payment   right   to   its   president   in  consideration   for   his   cancellation   of a   $600,000   loan.   Viewing   the   oil payment   right   as   a right to receive   future   income,   the   Court   applied   the  reasoning   of the   assignment   of income   doctrine,   normally   applicable   to a  gratuitous   assignment,   and   held   that   the   consideration   received   by the  taxpayer-corporation   was   taxable   as   ordinary   income   since   it essentially was   a substitute   for that   which   would   otherwise   be received   at a future time   as   ordinary   income.  Turning to the facts   of this   case, we note   that here   there was the  transfer of accounts receivable from the partnership to the corporation  pursuant to Section 351. We view these accounts receivable as   a present right to receive   future   income. In consideration of  the   transfer of this  right, the members of   the partnership received stock—a valid  consideration. The consideration, therefore, was essentially a substitute  for that which   would otherwise be received at  a future   time as ordinary  income to the cash basis partnership.   Consequently, the holding in Lake  would   normally apply, and   income   would ordinarily   be realized, and  thereby taxable, by the   cash basis partnership-transferor at the   time of  receipt   of  the   stock. But the   terms   and   purpose of Section   351   have to be reckoned with.  By its explicit terms   Section   351   expresses   the Congressional intent   that  transfers   of property for stock or securities   will  not result   in  recognition.  It therefore   becomes   apparent   that   this   case   vividly   illustrates how  Section   351   sometimes   comes into   conflict   with   another   provision   of the  101

--- Page 172 ---

102   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Internal   Revenue   Code   or   a   judicial   doctrine,   and   requires   a  determination   of which   of two   conflicting   doctrines   will control.  As   we   must,   when   we   try   to   reconcile   conflicting   doctrines   in   the  revenue   law,   we   endeavor   to   ascertain   a   controlling   Congressional mandate.   Section   351   has   been   described   as   a   deliberate   attempt   by  Congress   to   facilitate   the   incorporation   of ongoing   businesses   and   to  eliminate   any   technical   constructions   which   are   economically   unsound. Appellant-taxpayer   seems   to   recognize   this   and   argues   that application   of   the   Lake   rationale   when   accounts   receivable   are transferred   would   not   create   any   undue   hardship   to   an   incorporating  taxpayer.   “All   a   taxpayer   [transferor]   need   do   is withhold   the   earned  income   items   and   collect   them,   transferring   the   net   proceeds   to   the  Corporation.   Indeed   * * *   the   transferor   should   retain   both   accounts  receivable   and   accounts   payable   to avoid   income-recognition   at the   time  of   transfer   and   to   have   sufficient   funds   with   which   to   pay   accounts  payable.   Where   the   taxpayer   [transferor]   is   on   the   cash   method   of accounting   [as   here],   the   deduction   of the   accounts   payable   would   be  applied   against   the   income   generated   by the   accounts   receivable.”  While we   cannot fault the general principle “that income be taxed to  him who earns it,” to adopt   taxpayer’s argument would be to hamper the incorporation of ongoing businesses;   additionally it would   impose  technical constructions which are economically   and practically unsound. None of the   cases cited by taxpayer,   including Lake itself, persuades us  otherwise. In Lake the Court   was   required to decide whether the proceeds from the assignment of the oil payment right were taxable as ordinary income or   as long term capital   gains. Observing that   the provision for  long term capital gains treatment “has always   been narrowly   construed  so as   to protect   the revenue against artful devices,” 356 U.S. at 265,   78  S.Ct. at 694,   the Court   predicated its holding upon an emphatic distinction between a conversion of a capital investment—“income- producing property’—and an assignment of income per se. “The  substance of what was   assigned   was the   right to receive   future income.  The   substance of what was received was the present   value of income  which the   recipient would   otherwise obtain in the   future.” Ibid.,   at 266,  78 S.Ct.   at 695. A Section   351   issue was not presented in Lake. Therefore the   case does not   control   in weighing the conflict between the general rule   of assignment of income   and the Congressional   purpose of nonrecognition   upon the incorporation of  an ongoing business.  We are persuaded that,   on balance,   the teachings of Lake   must give  way in  this   case to the broad   Congressional interest   in  facilitating   the  incorporation of ongoing   businesses.   As   desirable as   it   is   to afford  symmetry in revenue law,  we   do  not  intend to promulgate a hard   and fast rule. We believe   that   the problems   posed   by the   clash   of   conflicting  internal   revenue   doctrines   are more   properly   determined   by   the circumstances of  each   case. Here   we   are   influenced   by  the   fact   that   the  subject  of the  assignment   was   accounts   receivable   for  partnership’s   goods

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION  and services sold in the regular course of business, that the change of  business   form   from   partnership to corporation had a basic business purpose   and was not designed for the purpose of deliberate tax avoidance, and by the conviction that   the totality   of circumstances here presented fit the mold of the Congressional intent to give nonrecognition to a transfer of a total business   from a non-corporate to a corporate form.  But   this   too   must   be   said.   Even   though   Section   351(a)   immunizes  the   transferor   from   immediate   tax   consequences,   Section   358   retains   for the   transferors   a   potential   income   tax   liability   to   be   realized   and  recognized   upon   a subsequent   sale   or   exchange   of the   stock   certificates  received.   As to the transferee-corporation,   the tax basis   of the receivables  will be governed   by Section   362.  uF at tat  Revenue   Ruling   95-74  1995-2   Cum.   Bull.   36.  ISSUES  (1)   Are   the liabilities   assumed   by S in the   § 351   exchange   described below   liabilities   for purposes   of §§ 357(c)(1)   and   358(d)? (2)   Once   assumed   by   S,   how   will   the   liabilities   in   the   § 351  exchange   described   below   be treated?  FACTS  Corporation P is an accrual basis, calendar-year corporation engagedy in various ongoing businesses, one of which includes the operation of a  manufacturing plant (the Manufacturing Business). The plant is located on land purchased   by   P many years before. The land was not  contaminated   by any hazardous waste when P  purchased it. However, as  a result   of plant   operations, certain environmental liabilities, such as  potential soil and groundwater remediation, are now associated   with the land.  In Year 1,  for bona fide business   purposes, P  engages in  an exchange  to which § 351 of the   Internal Revenue Code applies by transferring  substantially all of   the   assets associated   with the Manufacturing Business,   including the manufacturing plant and the land on which the  plant is located, to  a newly   formed corporation, S,  in exchange for all of  the   stock   of  § and for  S’s assumption of  the liabilities associated   with the  Manufacturing Business,   including the environmental liabilities  associated   with the  land. P has no plan or intention to dispose of  (or have S issue) any   S stock. S is an   accrual basis, calendar-year   taxpayer.  P did   not undertake   any   environmental   remediation efforts   in  connection   with   the   land   transferred to S  before   the   transfer   and did not  deduct or capitalize   any   amount   with   respect to   the   contingent  environmental liabilities   associated   with   the   transferred   land.  103

104   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  In   Year   3, S undertakes   soil   and   groundwater   remediation   efforts  relating   to the   land   transferred   in the   § 351   exchange   and   incurs   costs  (within   the   meaning   of the   economic   performance   rules   of § 461(h))   as   a  result   of those   remediation   efforts.   Of the total   amount   of costs   incurred,  a   portion   would   have   constituted   ordinary   and   necessary   business  expenses   that   are   deductible   under   § 162   and   the   remaining   portion  would   have   constituted   capital   expenditures   under   § 263   if there   had   not been   a   § 351   exchange   and   the   costs   for   remediation   efforts   had   been  incurred   by P. * *.*  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Issue   1: * * * The   legislative   history   of § 351   indicates   that   Congress viewed   an   incorporation   as   a mere   change   in the form   of the   underlying business   and   enacted   § 351   to   facilitate   such   business   adjustments  generally   by   allowing   taxpayers   to   incorporate   businesses   without recognizing   gain.   ***   Section   357(c)(1),   however,   provides   that   the  transferor   recognizes   gain   to   the   extent   that   the   amount   of liabilities  transferred   exceeds   the   aggregate   basis   of the   assets   transferred.  A number of cases concerning cash basis taxpayers   were litigated in the 1970s   with respect to the   definition of “liabilities”   for purposes of  § 357(c)(1), with sometimes conflicting analyses and results. ** * In response to this   litigation, Congress enacted § 357(c)(3) to address the concern that   the inclusion in the § 357(c)(1) determination of certain  deductible liabilities resulted in “unforeseen   and unintended tax  difficulties   for certain cash basis taxpayers who incorporate a going business.”   S.Rep. No.   1263, 95th   Cong., 2d Sess. 184—85 (1978), 1978-3  C.B. 482-83.  Congress   concluded that including in the § 357(c)(1) determination  habilities that have not   yet been   taken into account by the transferor results in an overstatement of liabilities of, and potential inappropriate gain  recognition to, the transferor because the transferor   has not received the corresponding   deduction or other corresponding tax   benefit. Id. To  prevent this   result, Congress   enacted § 357(c)(3)(A) to exclude certain  deductible liabilities from the   scope of § 357(c), as long as the liabilities  had not resulted in the   creation of,  or an increase in, the   basis of any  property (as provided in s 357(c)(3)(B)). * *  *  While § 357(c)(3)   explicitly addresses liabilities that   give rise   to deductible   items,   the same principle   applies to  liabilities that   give rise  to  capital expenditures as well. Including in  the § 357(c)(1) determination  those liabilities that have not   yet given rise   to capital expenditures   (and thus   have not  yet  created or increased basis) with   respect to the property  of   the   transferor   prior to the   transfer   also would result   in   an  overstatement of  liabilities. Thus,   such liabilities   also appropriately are  excluded in determining liabilities   for purposes of § 357(c)(1). *  * *  In  this   case,   the   contingent   environmental liabilities assumed   by §  had   not   yet   been   taken   into   account   by   P   prior   to   the   transfer   (and

--- Page 175 ---

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION Cure 2—   CCC   FORMATIONOF'ACORPORATION   —_—_ 105  therefore had neither   given rise to deductions for P nor resulted in the  creation of, or increase in, basis in any   property of P). As a result, the contingent environmental liabilities are not included in determining  whether the amount of the liabilities assumed by S exceeds the adjusted basis of the property transferred by  P  pursuant to § 357(c)(1).  Due   to   the   parallel   constructions   and   interrelated   function   and  mechanics   of   §§ 357   and   358,   liabilities   that   are   not   included   in   the  determination   under   § 357(c)(1)   also   are   not   included   in   the   § 358  determination   of the   transferor’s   basis   in the   stock   received   in the   § 351  exchange.   ***   Therefore,   the   contingent   environmental   liabilities  assumed   by S   are   not   treated   as   money   received   by   P   under   § 358   for purposes   of   determining   P’s   basis   in   the   stock   of   S   received   in   the exchange.  Issue   2: In Holdcroft   Transp.   Co. v. Commissioner,   153   F.2d   323   (8th  Cir.1946),   the   Court   of Appeals   for the   Eighth   Circuit   held   that,   after   a transfer   pursuant   to   the   predecessor   to   § 351,   the   payments   by   a  transferee   corporation   were   not   deductible   even   though   the   transferor  partnership   would   have   been   entitled   to deductions   for the payments   had  the   partnership   actually   made   the   payments.   The   court   stated   generally  that   the   expense   of settling   claims   or   liabilities   of a predecessor   entity did   not   arise   as   an   operating   expense   or   loss   of the   business   of the  transferee   but   was   a   part   of   the   cost   of   acquiring   the   predecessor’s  property,   and   the   fact that   the   claims   were   contingent   and   unliquidated  at the time   of the   acquisition   was   not   of controlling   consequence.  In Rev.   Rul.   80-198,   1980-2   C.B.   113,   an   individual   transferred   all  of   the   assets   and   liabilities   of   a   sole   proprietorship,   which   included accounts   payable   and   accounts   receivable,   to   a   new   corporation   in  exchange   for all of its stock.   The   revenue   ruling holds,   subject   to certain  limitations,   that   the   transfer   qualifies   as   an   exchange   within   the  meaning   of § 351(a)   and   that   the transferee   corporation   will report   in its  income   the   accounts   receivable   as   collected   and   will   be   allowed  deductions   under   § 162   for the payments   it makes   to satisfy the accounts  payable.   In reaching   these   holdings,   the revenue   ruling   makes   reference  to   the   specific   congressional   intent   of   § 351(a)   to   facilitate   the incorporation   of an   ongoing   business   by   making   the   incorporation   tax  free.   The   ruling   states   that   this   intent   would   be   equally   frustrated   if  either the transferor   were   taxed on the transfer   of the accounts   receivable  or   the   transferee   were   not   allowed   a   deduction   for   payment   of   the accounts   payable.   * * *  z The   present case is analogous to the   situation in Rev.   Rul. 80-198. For  business   reasons, P  transferred in a § 351 exchange substantially all of  the   assets and liabilities associated   with   the Manufacturing   Business to  S,  in exchange for  all of its stock, and   P  intends to remain in  control   of  S. The costs S  incurs to remediate   the   land   would   have   been   deductible  in   part   and   capitalized   in   part   had   P   continued   the Manufacturing Business   and   incurred   those   costs   to remediate   the   land.   The

--- Page 176 ---

106  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  congressional intent to facilitate necessary   business readjustments  would be frustrated by not according to S the ability to deduct or  capitalize   the expenses of the ongoing business. Therefore,   on   these   facts,   the   Internal   Revenue   Service   will   not  follow   the   decision   in Holdcroft   Transp.   Co.   v.   Commissioner,   153   F.2d 323   (8th Cir.1946).   Accordingly,   the contingent   environmental   liabilities  assumed   from   P are   deductible   as   business   expenses   under   § 162   or   are  capitalized   under   § 263,   as   appropriate,   by   S   under   S’s   method   of accounting   (determined   as   if S has   owned   the   land   for the   period   and   in  the   same   manner   as   it was   owned   by P).  HOLDINGS  (1)   The   liabilities   assumed   by   S   in   the   § 351   exchange   described  above   are   not   liabilities   for purposes   of § 357(c)(1)   and   § 358(d)   because the   liabilities   had   not   yet   been   taken   into   account   by   P   prior   to   the transfer   (and   therefore   had   neither   given   rise   to   deductions   for   P   nor resulted   in the   creation   of, or increase   in, basis   in any   property   of P).  (2) The liabilities assumed by S in the § 351 exchange described above are deductible by  S as business expenses   under § 162 or are capital expenditures   under § 263, as appropriate, under S’s method of accounting   (determined as   if S has owned the land for the period and in  the same manner as it was owned by P).  LIMITATIONS  The holdings   described above are subject to § 482 and other  applicable sections of the Code   and principles of law, including the limitations discussed in Rev. Rul. 80-198, 1980-2 C.B. 113   (limiting   the scope of the revenue ruling to transactions that   do not have a tax avoidance purpose). * * *  NOTE  Receivables and Payables. When there is a valid business   purpose for the   transfer of receivables and   payables on the incorporation of a going business, the   Service’s   position is that   the transferee   corporation   (and not the   transferor) must report   the receivables in income as they are collected  and   deduct the payables when they are   paid.®! This is consistent   with the holding in Hempt Brothers that   the assignment of income doctrine normally should not override   the honrecognition principle of Section 351. But to prevent   abuse in situations where receivables are accumulated or payables prepaid in anticipation of the   incorporation,   the   Service   has   noted the  following   limitations:92 Section 351 of  the Code does   not apply to  a transfer of accounts receivable   which   constitute   an assignment of  an income right   in a case   such as Brown v. Commissioner, 40   B.T.A.   565   (1939), aff'd  1   Rev.   Rul.   80-198,   1980-2 C.B.   113. See   also   Rev.   Rul.   95-74, p. 103   supra.  92 Td.

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION  115   F.2d   337 (2d  Cir.1940). In Brown, an attorney   transferred to a  corporation, in which he was the sole owner, a one-half interest in  a claim for legal services performed   by the attorney and his law  partner. In exchange, the attorney received   additional stock of the  corporation. The claim represented the corporation’s   only asset.  Subsequent to the   receipt by the corporation of the proceeds of the claim,   the attorney gave all of the   stock of the corporation to his  wife. The   United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  found that   the transfer of the claim for the fee to the corporation  had no purpose other than to avoid taxes and held that in such a case the intervention of the corporation would not prevent the  attorney   from   being liable for the tax on the income   which resulted  from services under the assignment of income rule of Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111, 50 S.Ct. 241 (1930). Accordingly, in a case   of a transfer to a controlled corporation of an account receivable in  respect of services rendered where there is a tax avoidance   purpose  for the transaction   (which might be evidenced by the corporation  not conducting an ongoing business), the Internal Revenue Service will continue to apply assignment of income principles and require  that   the transferor of such a receivable   include it in income when received by the transferee   corporation. Likewise,   it   may   be   appropriate   in   certain   situations   to  allocate   income,   deductions,   credits,   or allowances   to the transferor  or transferee   under   section   482   of the   Code   when   the timing   of the  incorporation   improperly   separates   income   from   related   expenses.  See   Rooney   v. United   States,   305   F.2d   681   (9th Cir.1962),   where   a  farming   operation   was   incorporated   in   a   transaction   described   in section   351(a)   after   the   expenses   of the   crop   had   been   incurred   but  before   the crop   had   been   sold and   income   realized.   The   transferor’s tax   return   contained   all of the   expenses   but   none   of the   farming income   to which   the   expenses   related.   The   United   States   Court   of  Appeals   for   the   Ninth   Circuit   held   that   the   expenses   could   be  allocated   under   section   482   to the   corporation,   to be matched   with  the income   to which   the expenses   related.   Similar   adjustments   may  be appropriate   where   some   assets,   liabilities,   or both,   are   retained  by the   transferor   and   such   retention   results   in the   income   of the  transferor,   transferee,   or both,   not   being   clearly   reflected.  Tax Benefit   Rule. Even   when a transferor   contributes   Section   351 “property” to a controlled   corporation, a problem   may arise if the  transferor  deducted the cost  of  that property prior to the  transfer. Under the  tax  benefit rule, if an amount has   been   deducted   and a later event   occurs   that is  “fundamentally inconsistent   with the premise on which the deduction   was  initially based,   the   earlier deduction   must be   effectively   “cancelled   out” by  the   recognition of income   equal to the amount previously   deducted.%   For example, a taxpayer   who   pays   $1,000 for minor office supplies to be  used in  his business   would   deduct   that amount   when paid   on   the assumption that those   supplies   soon   would   be   exhausted. If  that   taxpayer later   incorporates  i  93 See   Bittker   &   Lokken,   Federal   Taxation   of  Income,   Estates   and   Gifts § 5.7.1.  107

108   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   ;   PART   2  before   the supplies   are   used   and   receives   $1,000   of stock   in the exchange,   an  event   has occurred   that is inconsistent   with   the presumption   upon   which   the  earlier   deduction   was   based.   But   recognition   of $1,000   of current   income   on  the   transfer   of the   supplies   to   a   controlled   corporation   in   exchange   for   its  stock   is also   inconsistent   with   Section   351.  Whether   or   not   the   tax   benefit   rule   overrides   Section   351   has   been  unsettled   for many   years   but   the   importance   of the   issues   appears   to have diminished.   In   Nash   v.   United   States,9*   an   accrual   method   taxpayer  transferred   accounts   receivable   to   a newly   formed   corporation   in exchange  for stock.   The   taxpayer   already   had   included   the   receivables   in income   and also had   deducted   a reserve   for bad   debts.   Applying   the   tax benefit   rule,   the Service   argued   that   the taxpayer   should   be taxed   on   an   amount   equal   to the previously   deducted   bad   debt   reserve   because   the   taxpayer’s   presumption  that   some   of those   debts   would   turn   bad   while   held   in   his   business   had  proved   erroneous.   Although   the   debts   still   might-become   worthless,   that  event   would   occur   only   when   they   were   held   by   the   new   corporation—a  separate   business.   The   Supreme   Court   held   that   the   net   amount   the  taxpayer   had   included   in his   income   as a result   of the   receivables   (i.e., the  excess   of all   accrued   receivables   over   the   deducted   reserve   for   bad   debts) equaled   the value   of the stock   received   for the receivables,   so that   the earlier deduction   for   the   reserve   for bad   debts   was   not   inappropriate   and   did   not  generate   income   under   the   tax   benefit   rule.  The specific   fact pattern addressed in Nash is no longer important because accrual method taxpayers are now generally precluded   from  deducting a reserve for bad debts. Moreover, in a subsequent case, the  Supreme Court held that   the tax benefit rule applies whenever a later unforeseen event is “fundamentally inconsistent”   with the premise underlying a taxpayer's earlier deduction.® This broader   holding   suggests  that   the Court might   uphold application of the   tax benefit rule   in another  factual   setting involving a transfer to a newly   formed corporation. On the  other hand, the Code specifically provides that   the depreciation   recapture  provisions, which are grounded on  tax benefit rule  principles,   do  not override Section 351.96  PROBLEM  Architect, a cash basis taxpayer,   has been   conducting a business as   a sole proprietorship for several   years. For liability protection and to take advantage of  the   21 percent   corporate income tax   rate, Architect   decides to  incorporate, and on July 1 of  the current   year   he forms   Design, Inc.   a C corporation, to which he transfers   the  following assets:  94 398   U.S. 1, 90   S.Ct. 1550   (1970).

The   supplies   were   acquired   nine months   ago   and   their   cost   was   immediately   deducted   by   Architect   as   an ordinary   and   necessary   business   expense. In exchange,   Architect   receives   100   shares   of Design   common   stock with  a   fair   market   value   of   $100,000.   In   addition,   Design   assumes   $70,000   of  accounts   payable   to trade   creditors   of Architect’s   sole   proprietorship   and   a $30,000   bank   loan   incurred   by Architect   two   years   ago   for   valid   business  reasons,   and   it assumed   the   environmental   liabilities   associated   with   the  land. Design   elects   to become   a cash   method,   calendar   year   taxpayer.   During the   remainder   of the   current   year,   it pays   $30,000   of the   accounts   payable  and   collects   $40,000   of the   accounts   receivable   transferred   by Architect.   In  the   following   taxable   year,   Design   paid   $20,000   in   environmental  remediation   expenses   that   qualified   for   a current   deduction   under   Section  162   when   paid or   accrued.  (a) What are the tax consequences (gain or loss recognized, basis  and   holding   period)   of   the   incorporation   to   Architect   and  Design,   Inc.?  (b) Who will be taxable upon collection   of the accounts receivable:  Architect, Design or both?  (c) When Design pays the accounts   payable assumed from Architect and incurs   the environmental   remediation costs, may it properly   deduct these expenses? (d) Assume that Architect is in the highest marginal individual tax bracket   and Design, Inc. anticipates no significant taxable Jeo income for the current year. What result if Architect   decides to  pay   (and   deduct)   personally all the accounts   payable   and var  transfers   the accounts   receivable to the corporation?  (e) Would your answers be  any different if Architect had   been an accrual method taxpayer?  (f) Is Design, Inc. limited   in its choice   of accounting   method (i.e.,  cash or accrual) or taxable   year?   See   §§  441;   448.

110 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  F.   COLLATERAL   ISSUES 1.   CONTRIBUTIONS   TO   CAPITAL  Code:   §§ 118(a),   (b); 362(a)(2),   (c).  Regulations:   § 1.118—-1. When   a shareholder   transfers   property   to a corporation   and   does   not receive   stock   or   other   consideration   in   exchange,   the   transaction   is   a contribution   to   capital.   Although   Section   351   does   not   apply   to   capital  contributions,   the   contributing   shareholder   does   not   recognize   gain   or  loss   on   a contribution   of noncash   property   to a corporation.   Instead,   the  shareholder   may   increase   the   basis   in her   stock   by the   amount   of cash  and   the   adjusted   basis   of any   contributed   property.97   Contributions   to  capital   by shareholders   also   are   excludable   from   the   gross   income   of the  transferee   corporation.9®   The   corporation’s   basis   in property   received   as a   nontaxable   shareholder   contribution   to   capital   is   the   same   as   the  transferor’s   basis.99 Contributions   to   the   capital   of   a   corporation   by   nonshareholders historically   also   have   been   excluded   from   the   gross   income   of   a  corporation   unless   the contribution   was   in aid of construction   of property  or   from   a   customer   or   potential   customer   (with   an   exception   for contributions   in   aid   of   construction   for   certain   public   utilities).100   In  2017,   Congress   decided   to   further   limit   the   scope   of   nontaxable  contributions   to   capital   by   nonshareholders.   The   change   was   made   to eliminate   what   Congress   believed   was   an   inappropriate   federal   tax  subsidy   for financial   incentives   from   public   entities   and   customers   to get  corporations   to locate   their   operations   within   a particular   municipality  or   general   location.   Under   current   law,   taxable   contributions   to capital  by nonshareholders   include   (1) any   contribution   in aid of construction   or  any   other   contribution   from   a   customer   or   potential   customer,   and   (2) any   contribution   by a   governmental   entity   or   civic   group   (other   than   a  contribution   made   by a   shareholder   as   such).101   The   legislative   history  makes   it   clear   that   Section   118,   as   so   modified,   applies   only   to corporations,   a position   long held   by the   Service.102  97   Reg. § 1.118-1. %   TR.C.§   118(a).  99 IR.C.   § 362(a)(2). This rule parallels   Section 362(a)(1), which provides that   the  corporation   takes a transferred basis in property   received in a Section   351 exchange.   For   the corporation’s   basis in property   contributed   by a nonshareholder, see   I.R.C. § 362(c). 100 A corporation   takes a zero basis in noncash   property   contributed to capital by a  nonshareholder. 362(c)(1).   In   the   case   of cash   contributions by   nonshareholders, the   basis   of  property   acquired   by the corporation   with   such   cash in  the  following 12-month period is reduced  by the amount of  the  contribution. If there is an   excess   of a cash   contribution   over   this reduction the   excess   reduces   the basis   of  other   property   held by the   corporation.

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF A CORPORATION   111  If a   sole   shareholder   transfers   property   to   a   corporation,   or   if all  shareholders   transfer   property   in the   same   proportion   as   their   holdings, the   issuance   of   new   stock   has   no   economic   significance.   After   some waffling   on   the   issue,13   the   courts   now   agree   that   issuance   of stock   in these   circumstances   would   be “a meaningless   gesture”   and   consequently  have   held   that   such   transfers   are   constructive   Section   351   exchanges.  Majority   shareholders   of a   financially   distressed   corporation   may  surrender   some   of their   stock back   to the company   in order   to improve   its credit   rating.   The   proper   tax   treatment   of a   voluntary   contribution   of stock   that   is   not   pro   rata   perplexed   the   courts   for   many   years,   as  taxpayers   sought   to immediately   deduct   their   basis   in the   surrendered  shares   as an ordinary   loss while   the Service   contended   that the surrender  was   akin   to   a   contribution   to   capital.   In   Commissioner   v.   Fink,!%   the Supreme   Court   resolved   the   question   by   holding   that   controlling shareholders   do   not   realize   a   deductible   ordinary   loss   when   they  surrender   part   of their   stock   without   receiving   cash   or property   in return  and   retain   voting   control   of the   corporation.   The   Court   analogized   this type of transaction   to a shareholder’s   voluntary   forgiveness   of a corporate  debt   owed   to   the   shareholder,   which   is   treated   as   a   contribution   to  capital.   Basis   in   the   shares   surrendered   may   be   reallocated   to   stock retained   by the   shareholder.  2.   INTENTIONAL   AVOIDANCE   OF   SECTION   351  Section   351   is   not   an   elective   provision.   It   applies   whenever   its requirements   are   met.   Historically,   some   taxpayers   attempted   to   avoid  Section   351   in order   to recognize   a loss!   or   to   step-up   the   basis   of an asset   after recognizing   a gain to increase   the transferee   corporation’s   cost recovery   deductions.!97   When   long-term   capital   gains   enjoy   a significant tax   rate   preference,   taxpayers   have   also found   it advantageous   to freeze  appreciation   as   capital   gain   on   an   asset   that   was   about   to be   converted into   “ordinary   income”   property—e.g.,   land   held   for investment   that   the taxpayer   intended   to subdivide.   In these   cases,   the   tax   savings   achieved  by   converting   ordinary   income   into   capital   gain   outweighed   the disadvantage   of accelerating   recognition   of part of the   gain.  Planning to avoid   Section   351 may present as great a challenge as satisfying its requirements.   As illustrated by the Intermountain Lumber  103 See, e.g., Abegg v. Commissioner, 429   F.2d   1209 (2d   Cir.1970), cert. denied,   400 U.S. 1008,   91 S.Ct. 566 (1971).  ee 104 See, e.g., Peracchi v. Commissioner, supra p. 84. As   Peracchi illustrates, applying Section   351 to contributions to capital by a   sole shareholder may be   significant   insofar as it  triggers   the   application of other Code sections, such as Section 357,   to the  transaction.  105 483   U.S.   89, 107   S.Ct. 2729 (1987).  106 Recognition of losses   in this manner on a sale between a controlling   (more   than   50 percent)   shareholder   and a corporation   would   be limited by  Section   267.  107 But see   I.R.C. § 1239, which   characterizes   gain   on   sales   of  property   between   related  taxpayers (e.g.,   a corporation   and a more-than-50-percent   shareholder) as ordinary   income if the   property is depreciable   in  the  hands of the transferee.

112  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  case   earlier   in the chapter,!°8 one potentially   successful avoidance strategy is to break control after the exchange   by a prearranged disposition of more than 20 percent of the stock. Another possibility is to structure an incorporation transfer as   a taxable “sale” rather than a tax-  free Section   351 exchange.109  To illustrate   the   sale technique,   assume   Investor   owns   undeveloped land   with   an   adjusted   basis   of   $50,000   and   a   fair   market   value   of  $300,000.   Investor   intends   to   subdivide   the   land   and   sell   home   sites   at  an   aggregate   sales   price   of   $500,000.   If he   developed   the   land   as   an individual,   Investor   would   recognize   $450,000   of ordinary   income.!!°   But  with   long-term   capital   gains   taxed   at   a   significantly   lower   rate   than ordinary   income,   Investor   may   benefit   by selling the land   to a controlled corporation   for   $300,000   of corporate   installment   obligations.   He   would recognize   $250,000   of   predevelopment   capital   gain   on   the   sale,   the  corporation   would   take   a $300,000   stepped-up   basis   in the   land,   and   the  future   ordinary   income   would   be limited   to $200,000.  The   sale   strategy   was   successful   in Bradshaw   v.   United   States,!1  where   the taxpayer   transferred   40 acres   of Georgia   land   in which   he had  a   basis   of   $8,500   to   a   new   corporation   in   exchange   for   $250,000   of  unsecured   corporate   installment   notes.   The   corporation’s   only   other  capital was   a $4,500   automobile   transferred   on   the   same   day in exchange  for common   stock.   The   court   treated   the   transfer   of land   as   a   sale   and permitted   the   taxpayer   to report   his   gain   on   the   installment   method.112 In   so   doing,   the   court   rejected   the   Service’s   claim   that   the   notes   were  really   stock   even   though   it conceded   that   the   corporation   was   thinly capitalized.   A   contrary   result   was   reached   in   Burr   Oaks   Corp.   v.  Commissioner,!!3   where   three   taxpayers   transferred   land   to   a  corporation   in   exchange   for   two-year   notes   with   a   face   amount   of  $330,000.   The   corporation’s   only   equity   capital   was   $4,500.   The   court  held   that   the   transfer   was   a   nontaxable   Section   351   exchange   rather  than   a sale   because   the   notes,   payment   of which   was   dependent   on   the profitability of an undercapitalized corporation, were really preferred  stock.  In   the last analysis,   resolution of the   “Section   351 vs. sale” issue  turns on the facts   in each case and the court’s inclination to reclassify  108 See p. 61, supra.

Because a shareholder   and his wholly owned corporation are “related   parties,” a later   sale of  the   land by the   corporation will accelerate   recognition of any   gain   that otherwise   would   be  deferred   on   the   shareholder’s   installment sale   to the  corporation.

ORGANIZATIONAL   AND   START-UP   EXPENSES  Code:   §§ 195;   212(8);   248. Regulations:   § 1.248—1(b).  A   corporation   incurs   a   variety   of expenses   in   connection   with   its  incorporation.   Corporations   may   elect to deduct   currently   up   to $5,000   of these   “organizational   expenditures”   in   the   taxable   year   in   which   they  begin   business,   but   this   $5,000   maximum   current   deduction   is reduced  by   the   amount   by   which   total   organizational   expenditures   exceed  $50,000.115   Organizational   expenditures   that   are   not   currently  deductible   must   be amortized   over   the   180-month   period   beginning   with the   month   in which   the   corporation   begins   business.1!16   A similar   rule   is provided   for “start-up   expenditures,”!17   which   generally   are   amounts   the  corporation   incurs   after   formation   but   before   beginning   business  operations. “Organizational   expenditures”   are   defined   as   expenditures   which are:   (1)   incident   to   the   creation   of the   corporation,   (2)   chargeable   to  capital   account,   and   (3)   of a   character   which,   if expended   to   create   a  corporation   having a limited   life, would   be   amortizable   over   that   life.118 Examples   include   legal   fees   for   drafting   the   corporate   charter   and bylaws,   fees   paid   to the   state   of incorporation,   and   necessary   accounting services.119   Specifically   excluded   are   the   costs   of issuing   or   selling   stock and   expenditures   connected   with   the transfer   of assets   to the corporation, presumably   because   such   expenses   do   not   create   an   asset   that   is  exhausted   over   the   life of the corporation.!2°   “Start-up   expenditures”   are  amounts   that   the   corporation   could   have   deducted   currently   as   trade   or business   expenses   if they had been   incurred   in an   ongoing   business.   Pure  capital   expenditures,   such   as   costs   of acquiring   a   particular   asset,   are  neither   organizational   nor   start-up   expenditures   and   must   be capitalized  and   added   to the basis   of the   asset.  Whether or not they are borne   by the corporation,   certain   items are considered as expenses of the shareholders and, as such, they may  neither   be deducted nor amortized   by the   corporation.   For example,  114   See   Chapter   3B, infra.  115   T.R.C.   § 248(a)(1).  116   T.R.C.   § 248(a)(2). 117   .R.C.   § 195(b). 118   [.R.C.   § 248(b).  19   Reg. § 1.248-1(b)(2).  120 Reg.   §  1.248-1(b)(3)(i).

With   the   assistance   of B, a wealthy   investor,   A plans   to  incorporate   and   then   expand   the   business.   A will   contribute   the   assets   and  liabilities   of her   proprietorship   and   B will   invest   enough   cash   to give   him   a 49   percent   interest   in the   corporation.   After   numerous   appraisals,   lengthy  negotiations   and   considerable   expense,   A   and   B   have   agreed   that   the   net  worth   of A’s proprietorship   is $510,000.   B thus   will contribute   $490,000   cash for his 49 percent   interest.

CHAPTER   3  CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  A.   INTRODUCTION  1.   TAX   CONSEQUENCES   OF   DEBT   AND   EQUITY  Introduction.   The   organizers   of   a   business   venture   face   a   major  decision   in planning   the capital   structure   of their   company.   The   simplest  method   of raising   corporate   capital   is by   issuing   stock   in exchange   for  contributions   of money,   property   or   services.   Stock—known   as   “equity” in corporate   finance   parlance—may   be   common   or   preferred,   and   either  type   may   be issued   in various   classes   with   different   rights   and   priorities as   to   voting,   dividends,   liquidations,   convertibility,   and   the   like.   A corporation   also   may   raise   capital   by   borrowing,   either   from   the   same  insider   group   that   owns   the   company’s   stock   or   from   banks   and   other outside   lenders.   Corporate   debt   typically   is evidenced   by   a   variety   of  instruments   including   bonds,   notes,   convertible   debentures,   and   more  exotic   hybrid   securities   designed   by   Wall   Street’s   financial   architects. Although   both   shareholders   and   creditors   contribute   capital,   their  relationship   to the   corporation   is markedly   different.   As   one   early   case put it, a shareholder   is “an   adventurer   in the corporate   business,”   taking  risk   and   profit   from   success,   while   a   creditor,   “in   compensation   for not  sharing   the profits,   is to be paid independently   of the risk of success,   and gets   a right to dip into   capital   when   the   payment   date   arrives.”! To some extent, decisions concerning the proper mix of debt and equity are made without   regard to tax considerations. Most businesses  rely  on both short and   long-term debt to finance their operations. Quite apart   from taxes, traditional corporate   finance theorists believed that debt financing   contributed to   a higher rate   of investment return. This conventional wisdom did   not   go unchallenged. In their well-known writings on corporate finance, Professors Modigliani   and Miller   took   the  view that, assuming   away taxes and other factors, the value of a  corporation is unrelated to the amount of debt used in its capital  structure.2 On the   other hand, excessive   debt   has its pitfalls, and CFOs of   fiscally conservative public companies   may be   reluctant to risk  insolvency or a shaky credit rating by loading the  corporate   balance sheet  with liabilities.   In  short, many factors   other   than taxes affect corporate  financing   decisions.  1 (Commissioner v. O.P.P. Holding Corp.,   76  F.2d 11,   12  (2d Cir. 1935).  2 Fora general   discussion   of  the  debate,   Klein,   Coffee & Partnoy,   Business   Organization  and   Finance,   Legal   and   Economic Principles 352-385 (11th ed. 2010).  3 The   statement in  the  text  is belied   by  the  surge   of  debt  financing   that accompanied the  corporate   mergers   and   restructurings   of the   1980s,   the   significant   increases   in  corporate   debt  beginning   in   2001,   and   the   continuing   increase   in  corporate   debt   financing.

116  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Historical Tax Bias in Favor of Corporate   Debt   Financing. Although the tax system may not always drive financing   behavior, it can influence the   capital structure of both publicly traded and closely held C  corporations. Consider the decision facing A and B, who each   plan to  invest $100,000 on the formation of closely held Newco, Inc. At first  glance, it might   seem that issuing any Newco debt to A and B would be  a needless exercise. If the investors   agree on their respective contributions and the   allocation of ownership and voting   power, what  difference   does it make whether they hold stock, bonds or notes? The answer is often found in the Internal Revenue Code, which distinguishes between debt and equity for tax purposes   and historically has   tipped the scales   in favor of including a healthy dose of debt in a corporation’s capital   structure. This tax   bias toward debt financing   has been  influential both at the time of formation   and on   later occasions in a  corporation’s life cycle.  The   principal   tax   advantage   of issuing   debt   as   opposed   to equity   has  been   avoi   f the   “double   tax.”   Even   though   most   dividends   qualify  for   a   preferential   tax   rate,   they   still   are   includible   in   a   shareholder’s  income   and   are   not   deductible   by   the   corporation.   The   earnings  represented   by these   dividends   are   thus   taxed   at both   the   corporate   and  shareholder   levels.4   But   interest   paid   on   corporate   debt,   while   also  includible   in the   recipient’s   income,   generally   has   been   fully   deductible  by   the   corporation.   Assuming   the   owners   of   the   business   desire   an ongoing   return   on   their   investment   before   a   sale,   there   has   been   a   tax incentive   for   a   corporation   to   distribute   some   part   of its   earnings   with  tax-deductible   dollars.6   Additionally,   the   investment   return   earned   by  the   corporation   on   the   borrowed   funds   in excess   of the   cost   of borrowing  (the   interest   expense   net   of tax   savings)   accrues   to   the   benefit   of the  shareholders. Several   other   features of the tax law also have reflected a bias in  favor of debt over   equity. The repayment of principal on a corporate debt  is  a tax-free return of  capital to the   lender. If the amount repaid   exceeds  the   lender’s   basis in the debt, the   difference generally is treated as   a capital gain under Section 1271.   In contrast, when a corporation redeems (i.e., buys back) stock from a shareholder—a transaction quite   similar to the repayment of a debt—the entire amount received may be  taxed as   a  Concerning are Corporate   Debt Levels?,” March 7, 2019 at https://seekingalpha.com/article/  4247445-concerning-corporate-debt-levels (reporting   that   U.S. corporations   have   about   $9  trillion of debt, which is approximately 46  percent of GDP, a record level). * The   dividends   received deduction   provides   some additional tax relief   for corporate  shareholders.   See I.R.C. § 243   and   Chapter 4A, infra.  5)   LR-CES   168 (an  6 But see Andrews,   “Tax   Neutrality Between   Equity   Capital   and   Debt,”   30 Wayne L. Rey.   1057 (1984), suggesting   that   this traditional   “simple   view” is inadequate   because it  fails to recognize   the   opportunity for corporations to  raise   equity   capital by accumulating   earnings—a process   that   redounds to the   benefit   of  shareholders   without   subjecting   them to  tax   until   the  earnings   are   distributed or  the   shares   are   sold.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  dividend   if the   shareholder   or   related   persons   continue   to own   stock   in  the   corporation.7  The   issuance   of debt   at the time   of incorporation   also   may   provide   a defense   against   subsequent   imposition   of the accumulated   earnings   tax.8 The   obligation   to repay   a debt   at maturity   may   qualify   as   a “reasonable  business   need,”   justifying   an   accumulation   of corporate   earnings,?   while the   same   type   of accumulation   for a redemption   of stock   normally   is not regarded   as   reasonable   for purposes   of the   accumulated   earnings   tax.10  These   tax advantages   for corporate   debt financing   are   offset, to some degree,   by   the   shareholder-level   tax   benefits   for   equity   that   accrue   to taxable   shareholders.   Dividends   received   by individual   shareholders   are  taxed   at   preferential   rates and, to the extent corporate   profits are  accumulated,   those   shareholdérs   are   able   to realize   their   economic   gains  through   ck   sales   that   are   a   eeously   Ti   axed   at  preferential   long-term   capital   gam   rates.   Better   still, shareholders   who  hold   their   stock   until   death   are   able   pass   the   stock   to their   heirs   with   a  fair   market   value   basis   under   Section   1014.   On   the   other   hand,   tax- exempt   shareholders   (e.g.,   pension   funds,   wealthy   charities,   and   some  foreign   investors)   would   not have   the same   tax incentives   to favor   equity,  and   their   presence   would   tend   to   strengthen   the   historical   tax   bias   in favor   of corporate   debt   financing.!! The choice between debt and equity also has significant tax  ramifications in other contexts. For example, the   classification of a corporate investment may have an impact on whether transfers of property to a corporation qualify for nonrecognition   under Section 351. Complete nonrecognition of gain or loss is available   only when the contributing   taxpayer receives solely   stock. Conversely,   taxpayers who wish to recognize   gain on the   transfer of property to a controlled corporation may attempt to accomplish their objective by taking   back boot in the form of installment debt   obligations.12 That goal will be  thwarted if the   notes are reclassified as stock. Classification of an  interest in a corporation also may control   the character of a loss if the  investment   becomes worthless.13  7 LR.C. § 302. See Chapter 5C, infra. 8 [R.C.   §§  531 et  seq. See Chapter 14B,   supra.  9 Reg. § 1.537—2(b)(3). Repayment of debt owed to shareholders,   however, may be subjected to greater scrutiny. See Smoot   Sand   & Gravel Corp. v. Commissioner, 241   F.2d   197 (4th  Cir.1957), cert. denied   354 U.S.   922,   77 S.Ct. 1383 (1957).  ~ 10 See, e.g., Bittker & Eustice, Federal Income   Taxation of Corporations   and   Shareholders  q 7.07.  11 A 2016   study   by  researchers at the Tax Policy Center   concluded that   only   about   25  percent of all U.S.   corporate   stock is held by taxable   investors, down from   nearly   84  percent in  1965. The other   75  percent is held in tax-exempt accounts,   such as IRAs   and   other   retirement funds, or by foreigners or nonprofit   organizations.

118  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Changes Influencing the Tax Choice Between Debt and Equity. The   Tax Cuts and Jobs   Act made two significant  changes to the Code that alter the tax consequences of corporate debt  financing: (1) the   top corporate income tax   rate was reduced   from 35 to 21 percent, and (2) a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest was   enacted in Section 163(j). Importantly, the new section  163(j) limitation is scheduled to become even more restrictive after  2021.14 The details and potential impact of Section 163(j)   are covered in  the next section of this chapter.  The   reduction   in corporate   income   tax rates   significantly   reduces   the value   of a corporation’s   tax   deduction   for interest   expense   and   alters   the  calculation   of the   combined   corporate   and   investor   after-tax   cost   of debt and   equity   for corporations   with   taxable   investors.   For   example,   assume  that   a   corporation   has   $1,000   of taxable   income   and   one   hypothetical  investor   who   is taxable   on   additional   ordinary   income   at the   37   percent top individual   rate   (so that   qualified   dividends   are   taxable   at 20 percent) and   also is subject   to the   3.8 percent   tax on   net investment   income.   If the  corporation   first   pays   a   21   percent   income   tax   on   its   $1,000   of taxable  income   ($210),   it   will   have   $790   to   distribute   to   the   investor   as   a  dividend,   which   would   be taxable   at 23.8 percent.   The   investor   would   owe  $188   in tax   on   the   $790   dividend   and   the   combined   total   tax   owed   by the  corporation   and   the   investor   would   be   $398.   Alternatively,   assume   that  the corporation   pays   the investor   the $1,000   as tax deductible   interest   on  its   debt   obligation   to   the   investor.   In   that   case,   there   would   be   no corporate   income   tax   owed   as   a   result   of   the   corporation’s   interest  deduction   and   the investor   would   owe   a tax   of $408   (the combined   rate   is 40.8   percent,   the   total   of the   37   percent   income   tax   plus   the   3.8   percent tax on   net investment   income).   Note   that the total corporate   and   investor  tax   in the   dividend   scenario   ($398)   is less   than   the   total   corporate   and investor   tax   in   the   interest-expense   scenario.   The   example   illustrates  that att inal individuali e tax rates, the shareholder  tax benefits afforded to dividend income can   slightly outweigh the benefit  i te income tax   via   tax deductible interest. e b att   uction 1   orate income tax 021  pergent   reduces the value of the   corporation’s deduction for interest  expense. ca aay  Will   the  cut  in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent   and the reduction in  the   tax   benefits   of corporate   debt   lead to   a future   reduction in debt  financing by   American corporations?   Interestingly,   the empirical evidence   suggests   that   past   tax law   changes   have   had no significant effect  on changes in  the capital   structure of publicly   traded companies. 15 Some researchers also hypothesize that   debt   financing is more likely   to  4 See   Section A2 of  this chapter, infra. 6 See Hackbarth   & Zhou,   Effects   of New Tax   Law on   Capi  ; pital Structure   and   Cost   of  Capital,   158 Tax   Notes   1523 (March 2018), which   summarizes   research   on   the  effects   of  the Tax Reform   Act  of  1986,   which   reduced   the  corporate   tax rate from   46  percent to 36 percent,   and   tax law   changes   over   longer   periods,   including   the  last  century.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  increase   as   a result   of a tax   increase   than   it is to decrease   as   a result   of  tax rate   cuts.   Theoretical   explanations   for the expected   limited   reduction  in debt financing   after the corporate   tax rate cut include:   (1) the fact that  buying   back   debt   is a cost   born   by equity   holders,   while   the   remaining  debt holders   benefit   as a result of their debt becoming   less risky and   more valuable;   (2) refinancing   corporate   debt   through   issuance   of additional  stock   may   lead   to   potential   adverse   dilution   in   the   value   of   the corporation’s   shares;   (8)   a   significant   number   of   faster-growing   and smaller   public   companies   are   initially   under-leveraged   and   as   they   grow  optimistic   managers   will   prefer   to   debt   finance   future   growth;   and   (4)  leverage   should   be measured   net   of corporate   cash   and   on   that basis   it 1s  low   as   a result   cash   locked   up   in overseas   investments   which   has   become  more   accessible   as   a result   of international   tax   changes   made   by the Tax Cuts   and   Jobs   Act.16  In   summary,   the   reduction   in the   corporate   tax   rate   to   21   percent  has   no   doubt   increased   corporate   cash   flow.   But   the   empirical   and theoretical   research   does   not   seem   to support   the notion   that the tax rate cut   alone   will   significantly   change   the   levels   of corporate   debt   financing  by   publicly   traded   companies.   Perhaps   shareholders   in   closely   held  companies   will   be   more   responsive   to   the   tax   incentives   created   in the  post-Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs   Act   rate   environment.   It is early   and,   no   doubt,  more   evidence   of taxpayer   behavior   will be available   in the future.  2. LIMITATION ON DEDUCTION OF BUSINESS   INTEREST  Code:   § 163G).  Introduction. The   Tax Cuts and Jobs   Act amended Section   163G) of  the Code to limit the deduction for “business interest” for any taxable year. The limitation was   enacted to reduce the   tax incentive for debt  financing of business activities and to offset some of the revenue costs   of  the corporate tax   rate reduction and other business tax   benefits. The  House Ways and Means   Committee explained the reason for the  change:!7 The Committee believes   that   the general deductibility of  interest payments on debt may result   in companies   undertaking  more   leverage   than   they would in the absence of  the  tax system.  The effective marginal tax   rate   on debt-financed   investment is  lower   than that   on equity-financed   investment.   Limiting the deductibility of  interest along   with   reducing the corporate tax  rate narrows the   disparity in   the   effective marginal tax   rates based on   different   sources of  financing.   This   leads to   a more  efficient  capital  structuré for  firms.  The   Section 163(j) deduction   cap is the sum of: (1) business   interest  income for   the   taxable   year;   (2) 30   percent   of  the   taxpayer's   “adjusted  16   Id.  17H.   Rep.

120  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  taxable income;” and (3) the taxpayer’s “floor financing interest”   (a specialized category for retail car dealers).18 Business interest disallowed under this\ provision may be   carried forward indefinitely.19 The new limitation applies to all business   taxpayers, not just corporations, and it  is applied after any other   limitations, such as those requiring deferral or capitalization of interest expense in certain situations. Special rules, not  directly relevant to C corporations, apply to pass-through entities.?° “Business   interest”   is any   interest   paid   or   accrued   on   indebtedness properly   allocable   to a trade   or business.   It does   not   include   “investment interest,”   which   continues   to be subject   to its own   set of limitations   under  Section   163(d).   Business   interest   income   is interest   income   allocable   to a  trade   or   business.?!   In the   case   of a   C corporation,   virtually   all interest  income   and   expense   will be allocable   to its trade   or business   activities.  Definition   of Adjusted   Taxable   Income.   The   key   measure   for   the deduction   cap   is “adjusted   taxable   income”   (“ATI”),   which   is defined   as  the taxpayer’s   taxable   income   computed   without   regard   to:   (1) tax   items not   properly   allocable   to   a   trade   or   business;   (2) any   business   interest  expense   or business   interest   income;   (3) the   amount   of any   net   operating loss deduction;   (4) the   20 percent   deduction   provided   by Section   199A   for certain   “qualified   business   income”   from   pass-through   entities;   and   (5)  for   tax   years   beginning   before   January   1,   2022,   deductions   for depreciation,   amortization   or   depletion   (this category   would   include   any costs   expensed   under   Sections   168(k)   or   179).22   ATI   is thus   conceptually similar   to   what   is known   in   accounting   jargon   as   EBITDA   (earnings  before   interest,   taxes,   depreciation   and   amortization),   a   metric   used   by  financial   analysts   to   measure   a   company’s   operating   performance  without   regard   to its capital   structure,   taxes,   or cost recovery   deductions.  Definition of ATI After Year 2021. Beginning in 2022, ATI is determined without   adding   back   depreciation and   amortization so that it resembles EBIT (earnings before   interest and taxes). In most cases, the  impact of this change is  to lower the   ceiling (because the   cap will be   30  percent of a lower number), further   limiting   the deduction for business  interest. The   combination of immediate   expensing for equipment and the harsher   post-2021 cap   has the odd effect of punishing   companies that increase their   capital investment. This   future change in the formula  presumably was made to increase   the revenue   estimates for the   “out years” of the relevant budget window rather   than for any   discernable  policy  reasons. Thus, there is  at  least some possibility, that the post-2021 change in the ATI   formula may be  repealed or modified. Png Special Relief Provisions.   Relief from the business interest deduction limitation is provided for “small   businesses,”   which   generally are  18   T.R.C.-§   163G)(1). 19   IR.C.   § 163(4)(2),  20   See   I.R.C.   § 163(j)(4).  1   LR.C.   § 163G)(5),   (6). #2   L.R.C.   § 163(j)(8).

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  taxpayers   with   average   annual   gross   receipts   not   exceeding   $25   million for   the   three-year   period   ending   with   the   prior   taxable   year.23   An  exception   also   is available,   at the   taxpayer’s   election,   to a real   property trade   or business,   as broadly   defined   in Section   469(c)(7)(C)   to encompass  real   estate   development,   redevelopment,   construction,   reconstruction,  acquisition,   conversion,   rental,   operation,   management,   leasing,  brokerage   trade   or   business,   and   (according   to   the   legislative   history)  operation   or   management   of   a   lodging   facility.24   The   trade-off   for  taxpayers   who   make   this   election   is   that   they   must   use   the   slightly  slower   alternative   depreciation   system   under   Section   168(g),   which  requires   straight   line   cost   recovery   over   30   years   for residential   rental  property   (instead   of 27.5   years)   and   40   year   for   commercial   property  (instead   of 39 years).   Real   estate   businesses   will need   to do a cost/benefit  analysis   in deciding   whether   or   not   to   make   this   election.   Similarly,   at  the taxpayer’s   election,   any   farming   business   and   certain   agricultural   or  horticultural   cooperatives,   will   not   be   subject   to   the   Section   163()  interest   deduction   limitation.”5  The   introduction   of a limitation   on the deduction   of business   interest  may   be one   of the most   profound   changes   made   by the Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs Act   because   of importance   of debt   financing   in business   activities.   The IRS   has   issued   extensive   proposed   regulations   interpreting   various  aspects   of   the   Section   163(j)   limitation   on   business   interest.?6   Those proposed   regulations:   (1)   define   “business   interest”   expansively;   (2)  explain   how   the   business   interest   limitation   interacts   with   other provisions   of the   Code,   including   deduction   limitations;   (3) clarify   the statutory   definition   of adjusted   taxable   income   and   provide   the   other  adjustments   authorized   by   § 163()(8)(B);   (4)   address   specialized situations,   such   as the treatment   of partnerships   and S corporations   and  application   of the limitation   to affiliated   groups   of domestic   corporations, foreign   corporations,   and   other   foreign   persons   with   income   effectively  connected   to a U.S.   trade   or business;   and   (5) much   more.   The   proposed regulations   also   make   it clear   that   the business   interest   limitation   rules  of § 163)   have   no   effect   on   a corporation’s   earnings   and   profits.27 The ”big question” is how   many corporations will actually   be  subject  to the   Section   163()   limitation and   whether firms will modify their  capital   structures in response to the   provision. Researchers   have examined the   public   financial information of 333 companies in the S&P  500 over fiscal years 2007-2017 to gauge the   potential impact of Section  163(j). The   sample   excluded   companies in   the   financial   services,   real  ae ee ee a 23° T.R.C. § 163G)(3). 24 T.R.C. § 163G)(7)(A)Gi), (B).  2 TRC.   § 163G)(7)(A)Gii), (C).

122  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  estate,   and   public   utilities   industries.28   Based   on   the financial   statement  data,   it appeared   that   about   five   percent   of the   corporations   would   face the   Section   163(j)   limitation   at   some   time   during   the   period   of 2018  through   2021,   when   the   more   generous   limitation   applies.   Beginning   in  2022,   the   researchers   estimate   that   a   significant   number   of companies may   be   subject   to   the   limitation.   In   fact,   105   of the   333   corporations potentially   would   have   exceeded   the   EBIT   limit   at   least   once   between  2007   and   2017,   and   26 of the corporations   would   have   exceeded   that   limit  six or more   times   during   that time   period.29   The   researchers   also focused  more   specifically   on   the financial   data   of those   26 corporations   and   found  many   are   in the process   of adjusting   their   debt   structures.   Some   of those taxpayers   have   pre-2017   net   operating   losses   which   can   be used   to offset 100   percent   of taxable   income   in   future   years,   thereby   allowing   more  time   to make   changes   in their   capital   structures.   The   other   corporations in the 26 “at risk” group   appear   to be following   various   strategies   to lower  interest   expense,   including   (1) issuing   new   debt   at lower   interest   rates   to  retire   higher   rate   debt   obligations,   and   (2) retiring   debt   with   cash   flow   or through   newly   issue   equity.3°   This   research   indicates   that   Section   163(j) will modify   the future   behavior   of corporations   in danger   of exceeding   its  limitation   on   the   deductibility   of business   interest.  3. OTHER LIMITATIONS ON   THE CORPORATE INTEREST DEDUCTION  At  times in the past, Congress has turned its attention to the   issue  of excessive corporate debt, but   these   sporadic efforts generally   were cautious and limited. Instead of devising a comprehensive solution like Section 163(j), the   typical   legislative response   was a narrowly targeted  set of limitations aimed at particular perceived   abuses, accompanied   by a delegation to the Treasury to elaborate through regulations.   This “rifle- shot” approach   produced a laundry list of special provisions which taxpayers also must successfully navigate in order to secure a deduction  for interest expense. A summary of some of the key provisions follows. Limitation on Certain   Acquisition   Indebtedness.   Section   279  disallows a deduction for interest on “corporate   acquisition indebtedness” in excess of $5 million. Corporate acquisition indebtedness generally is debt  incurred to acquire either   stock in another corporation, or two-thirds  of the   assets of another   corporation, where (1) the   debt is subordinated,  (2) the   debt is convertible to equity or otherwise carries a feature to acquire   equity of  the  issuer, and (3) the issuer is either   thinly  capitalized (a debt-equity ratio   in excess   of 2 to 1) or   its projected   earnings   do   not  aa Betancourt,  Nichols & Scott, “Tax   Reform’s   Interest Deduction   Limitation:   Preliminary  Evidence,   160 Tax   Notes   1545 (Sept.   10, 2018). The   sample also  uses GAAP   EBIT   and EBITDA as proxies for ATI,   which is acknowledged as limitation.  2 I  30 Id. Some   have   also pursued   strategies   which   employ   offshore   borrowing.

CHAPTER 3 CAPITAL STRUCTURE  exceed   three   times   annual   interest   costs.3!   Section   279   contains   various  excepted   transactions,   including   acquisitions   of less   than   five percent   of the   stock   of another   corporation,   nontaxable   transactions   where   there   is  already   80   percent   control   of   the   target,   and   acquisitions   of   foreign corporations.?2   More   importantly,   Section   279   does   not   apply   to   debt  issued   to acquire   stock   of the issuing   corporation   (e.g., a leveraged   share buyback)   and   can   easily   be avoided   by failing   to satisfy   the   definition   of  “corporate   acquisition   indebtedness,”   such   as   the   requirement   that   the debt   be convertible   into   equity   or include   an   equity   feature. Applicable   High-Yield   Discount   Obligations.   One   object   of  congressional   scrutiny was   a type of high-yield   debt instrument   that does  not   currently   pay   interest   in cash   to the lender.   This   type   of junk bond   is  usually   structured   as   a zero-coupon   instrument   with   an   issue   price   that is significantly   lower   than   the stated   redemption   price at maturity.33   The “spread”   between   the   issue   and   redemption   price   is   “original   issue  discount”   (“OID”).   In   general,   the   issuer   of an   OID   bond   accrues   and  deducts   the “spread”   as interest   over   the life of the bond   even   though   the interest   is not   actually   paid until   maturity,   and   the lender   (even if a cash basis   taxpayer)   includes   OID   in income   over   the life of the bond.34  A   sensible   solution   would   have   been   to treat   high-yield   zero   coupon bonds   as   preferred   stock   on   the   theory   that   their   high   level   of risk   and  dependence   on   the   profitability   of the   business   causes   them   to   more  resemble   equity   than   debt.   The   legislation   ultimately   enacted®>   did   not  go   that   far.   Instead,   Congress   decided   to   defer   (and   in   some   cases disallow)   the issuer’s   deduction   until interest   is actually   paid in cash   but  continue   to require   the   lender   to recognize   interest   income   as   it accrues.  This   approach   represented   a   congressional   willingness   to   bifurcate  certain   hybrid   securities   into   debt   and   equity   components.   The   theory   is  that   a   portion   of   the   return   on   certain   junk   bonds   represents   a distribution   of corporate   earnings   with   respect   to   an   equity   interest   in the   corporation   and   should   be treated   as   such   for tax   purposes.  The restrictions in Section 163(e)(5) apply to an “applicable   high- yield discount obligation,” which is defined in Section   163@) as an  instrument with: (1)   a more   than five-year maturity, (2) a yield to  maturity that is five percentage points or more   than the applicable  federal rate   in  effect   for the month in which the  obligation is issued, and  (3) “significant   original   issue   discount.”%6 The   OID   amount on these  —   81   Seel.R.C.   § 279(a)e). 32 TR.C. § 279(d)(5), (e) & (f). See also, LR.C. § 279(g) regarding the   rules when the  issuing   corporation is a member of  an   affiliated group. 33 A zero coupon   bond is   a debt instrument that   pays no   interest and is sold   at   a significant   discount   from its face  value.  34 See I.R.C. §§  1272-1273.  35   See   I.R.C.   § 163(e)(5),   (i).  36 A virtually   incomprehensible   definition   of  “significant   original issue   discount” appears in  Section   163(i)(2). Oversimplifying   considerably,   OID is  “significant”   if  the   OID   income   that  123

124  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  bonds is divided between an interest element that is deductible   but   only when interest is actually paid,37 and a return of equity element (“the disqualified portion”) for which no interest deduction is allowed but which may be eligible for the dividends received deduction in the case of a corporate lender.38 This approach is a compromise between deferral and  total disallowance of the issuer’s interest deduction. An instrument  generally will have a “disqualified   portion” of OID and thus face disallowance of part of the interest deduction if it has significant OID and  the yield on the instrument is more than six percentage points over the  applicable federal rate.?9  Interest   Paid   on   Disqualified   Debt   Instrument.   Section   163(/)  generally   disallows   a deduction   for interest   or   OID   on   a debt   instrument which   is payable   in equity   of the   issuer   or   a related   party   or   equity   held  by the issuer   or a related   party.   This   type   of “payment-in-kind”   bond   also offered   the   possibility   of a   current   interest   deduction   without   a   cash  expenditure.   Debt   generally   is   considered   payable   in   equity   only   if a  substantial   amount   of the principal   or interest   is either   (1) required   to be  paid or converted   into   such   equity,   or   (2) is required   to be determined   by  reference   to   such   equity.4°   Note   that   section   163(J)   only   disallows   the  issuer’s   interest   deduction.   The   holder   still recognizes   income   as   interest  amounts   are   paid or   accrued.  Information   Reporting.   Section   60438(c)   requires   information reporting   to the   IRS.   when   (1) control   (as defined   in Section   304(c)(1))   of  a   corporation   is   acquired   in   any   transaction,   or   (2)   there   is   a  recapitalization   of   a   corporation   or   other   substantial   change   in   the capital   structure   of a   corporation.   The   regulations   generally   limit   the reporting   requirement   to   situations   where   the   fair   market   value   of the stock   acquired   is $100   million   or   more,   and   changes   in capital   structure  where   the   cash   and   fair   market   value   of   property   provided   to  shareholders   is $100   million   or   more.41  B.   DEBT   VS.   EQUITY  1.   COMMON   LAW   STANDARDS  Taxpayers have   considerable flexibility to structure   corporate instruments as debt or equity.   In view of the sharply   disparate tax treatment of debt and equity, it  is hardly   surprising that the  Service may  *  accrues in periods ending   more   than five years after the bond is issued   exceeds interest   actually paid on   the  bond. 37 “Payments” for  this purpose are limited to actual pa ments of cash  than the   stock or debt of  the   issuer.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE   125  be   unwilling   to accept   the   taxpayer’s   label   as   controlling.42   Form   would be   elevated   over   substance   if every   piece   of   paper   embossed   with   a corporate   seal   and   bearing   the   label   “debt”   were   treated   as   such   for tax  purposes.   To prevent   tax avoidance   through   the use   of excessive   debt, the Service   may   recast   a   purported   debt   obligation   _as   equity.   The   tax consequences   of a   recharacterization   can   be   extremely   unpleasant.   An  interest   payment   becomes   a   dividend   and   the   corporation   loses   its  deduction.   If and   when   the   note   is repaid,   the   “creditor”   finds   himself   in the role of shareholder,   and   the “loan repayment”   may   turn   into a taxable dividend   instead   of a tax-free   return   of capital.  It   is   one   thing   to   list   the   advantages   of   debt   and   identify   the unfortunate   ramifications   of   reclassification.   It   is   quite   another   to  describe   with   any   precision   the   process   employed   by the   courts   and   the Service   to determine   whether   a   particular   instrument   is debt   or   equity.  a   ering   chee heTees bycleseribing @specirun Stone  end is equity, a   risk investment with the potential to share in   corporate  profits.   At   the   other   end   is   debt,   evidenced   by   the   corporation’s unconditional   promise   to   pay   back   the   contributed   funds,   with   market  rate   interest,   at   a   fixed   maturity   date.   A   pure   equity   investor—the  shareholder—has   voting   rights   and   upside   potential.   A   pure   debt  holder—the   creditor—is   an   outsider   with   no   prospect   of sharing   in the  growth   of   the   enterprise.   Many   classification   controversies   involve “hybrid   securities”   having   features   common   to both   debt   and   equity,   and the   courts must decide whether these instruments falling   in the middle  of the spectrum are closer to one end or the other.  Any process that   looks at something decidedly   gray and tries   to  determine   whether it more closely resembles black or white is bound to be   frustrating. And so   it  is here. The litigated   cases are legion and the  court   decisions have   been aptly vilified   as   a “jungle”43 and a “viper’s tangle.”44 The issue is murky because classification of an obligation as debt or equity   traditionally is treated as   a question of fact to be  resolved by applying   vague   standards that require the weighing of many factors.* In a manner reminiscent of the approach to determining   whether an  asset is “held primarily for sale to customers,” the   courts have spewed fort undry lists of “factors,” but it  is difficult to discern which are controlling in a given case. Exhaustive research leaves   one with the  firm  42 The   characterization of an instrument at its issuance is binding on   the   issuer, but not the   Service. I.R.C. § 385(c)(1). A holder of  an instrument generally is bound   by the   issuer’s characterization   unless the   holder discloses   an inconsistent   position on a tax   return.

The   courts   are   divided   over whether the   debt vs. equity   question is one   of  fact  or law, or a  mixed   question   of fact  and   law.   See   Indmar   Products   Co.,  Inc. v.

126  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  conviction that the courts are applying an amorphous and highly  unsatisfactory “smell test.”  Synthesizing   the   decisional   morass   is a perilous   enterprise,   but   the principal   factors   enunciated   by   the   courts   over   the   years   may   be  summarized as follaws:46  Form   of   the   Obligation.   Labels   are   hardly   controlling,   but   the  decisions   provide   some   guidance   for   a   corporation   that   wishes   to   avoid  reclassification   of debt as equity. At   a minimum,   debt instruments   should bear the usual   indicia   of debt—an   unconditional   promise   to pay;   a specific  term;   remedies   for   a   default;   and   a   stated,   reasonable   rate   of interest, payable   in   all   events.47   Equity   characteristics   should   be   avoided.   For  example,   the   likelihood   of reclassification   is far   greater   with   a   hybrid  instrument   that   makes   payment   of interest   contingent   on   earnings   or provides   the holder   with   voting   rights.4§  The   Debt/Equity.   Ratio.   The   debt/equity   ratio   of a corporation   is the ratio   of the   company’s   liabilities   to   the   shareholders’   equity.   The   ratio  has   long been   used   as   a tool to determine   whether   a corporation   is thinly  capitalized.   Thin   capitalization,   in turn,   creates   a   substantial   risk   that  what   purports   to be debt   will be reclassified   as   equity   on   the   theory   that no rational   creditor   would   lend   money   to a corporation   with   such   nominal  equity.  The trouble with this attempt at quantification is that   the   cases are inconsistent as   to what constitutes an excessive debt/equity ratio. For example, depending on all the other factors, a debt/equity ratio   of  3-to-1,  which most would regard as conservative,   has been held to be excessive, 49  while ratios of  50-to-1 and higher have   been held to be  acceptable.59 Some  cases apply different norms for different   industries,51 others   ignore the ratio   entirely,52 and   some evaluate the ratio   in the context of the   overall  growth prospects of the business.53  46 See   generally Plumb, “The   Federal Income   Tax Significance of Corporate Debt: A  Critical Analysis   and a Proposal,”   26 Tax L.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  And   how   is the   debt/equity   ratio   to be   computed?   Consider   some   of  the basic   questions   on which   there has been   disagreement.   Is debt limited to shareholder   debt   or   does   it include   debts   to outsiders?54   Does   outside  debt   include   accounts   payable   to   trade   creditors   or   only   long-term habilities?   What   about   shareholder   guaranteed   debt?55   In   determining  “equity,”   are   assets   taken   into   account   at their   book   value   (i.e., adjusted  basis)   or   fair   market   value?5é¢   The   differences   in   approach   can   be  considerable.  Intent.   Some   cases   have   turned   on the “intent”   of the parties   to create  a debtor-creditor   relationship.®?   “Intent”   presumably   is not   gleaned   by a subjective   inquiry;   it   would   be   meaningless   to   place   the   corporate  insiders   on   the   witness   stand   and   ask   whether   they   “intended”   to   be  shareholders   or creditors.   The   more   reasoned   decisions   measure   “intent”  by   objective   criteria   such   as   the   lender’s   reasonable   expectation   of  repayment,   evaluated   in light   of the   financial   condition   of the   company, and   the   corporation’s   ability   to   pay   principal   and   interest.5®   Hindsight also   plays   a role.   For   example,   if the corporation   consistently   fails to pay interest   or repay   debts   when   they are   due, its claim   to debtor   status   may be highly   questionable.59  Proportionality.   In   a   closely   held   setting,   debt   held   by   the  shareholders   in   the   same   proportion   as   their   stock   holdings   normally  raises   the   eyebrows   of the   Service.®9   The   rationale   is that   if debt   is held  in roughly   the same   proportion   as stock,   the “creditors”   have   no   economic incentive   to act like creditors   by setting   or enforcing   the   terms   of the   so- called   liability.   The   unanswered   question   is   whether   proportionality, without   other   negative   factors,   is   sufficient   in   itself   to   convert   the obligation   into   stock.®!  54 Compare   Ambassador Apartments, Inc. v.

Commissioner, 748   F.2d 1365 (9th   Cir.1984),   the   court computed stockholders’   equity by adding together   paid-in   capital  and retained   earnings   and arrived at outside   debt/equity ratios for different years ranging   from  approximately 2 to 1 to 8 to 1. The   Tax   Court   had   determined a ratio   for one   year of  approximately 92 to 1 by limiting   shareholders’   equity to  initial paid-in capital. 57 See Gooding Amusement Co. v.

128  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS ; PART 2  Subordination.   If   a   corporation   has   borrowed   from   both shareholders   and   outside   sources,   the   independent   creditors   frequently  will   require   that   the   shareholder   debt   be   subordinated   to the   claims   of general   creditors.   Although   subordination   of inside   debt   would   appear   to  be inevitable   if significant   unsecured   outside   financing   is desired,   some  courts   have   regarded   it as   the   smoking   pistol.62   Once   again,   however,   it  is difficult to advise   a client with   any certainty   that   subordination   is fatal per   se.   The   economic   realities   of closely held corporate   life would   suggest  that   it should   not   be   determinative,   but   it grows   in   importance   when combined   with   other   negative   factors   such   as   thin   capitalization, proportionality,   and   failure   to pay   any   dividends.®  This   distillation   of factors   barely   scratches   the   surface.   The   Indmar  Products   case,   which   follows,   provides   an   illustration   of   one   court’s  approach   to the   problem.  Indmar   Products   Co.,   Inc.   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Sixth   Circuit,   2006.  444   F.3d   771.  = MCKEAGUE,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE.  Indmar Products Co., Inc. (“Indmar”)   appeals the decision of the Tax Court to disallow interest deductions the company claimed for tax years  1998-2000,   and to assess accuracy-related tax penalties for those years.  The interest deductions relate to a number of advances made to Indmar  by its majority   stockholders over several years. Indmar argued at trial that   the advances were   legitimate loans made to the company, and thus it could properly   deduct the   interest payments   made on these advances under 26  U.S.C. § 163(a). The   Tax Court,   following the   position taken by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (the “Commissioner”), disagreed,  concluding that the advances were   equity  contributions and therefore   the  company could not deduct   any purported interest payments on these  advances. The court imposed penalties on Indmar based on   the  deductions. *  *  *  Upon review of the   record, we   conclude that   the Tax   Court clearly erred in finding the advances   were equity. The   Tax   Court failed to consider   several   factors used by this court for determining   whether advances are debt or equity, ignored   relevant   evidence, and   drew several unsupported inferences   from its factual   findings. We reverse and find  that   the stockholder   advances   were   bona fide   debt.  62 See   P.M. Finance Corp. v. Commissioner,   302   F.2d   786, 789-90 (3d   Cir.1962);   R.C.  Owen   Co, v.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE   129  I.   BACKGROUND  A.   Stockholder   Advances   to Indmar  Indmar,   a Tennessee   corporation,   is   a marine   engine   manufacturer. In   1973,   Richard   Rowe,   Sr., and   Marty   Hoffman   owned   equal   shares   of  Indmar.   In   1987,   after   Hoffman   passed   away,   Richard   and   his   wife, Donna   Rowe,   together   owned   74.44%   of Indmar,   with   their   children   and  children’s   spouses   owning   the   rest.   By   all accounts,   Indmar   has   been   a successful   company.   From   1986   to   2000,   Indmar’s   sales   and   costs-of-  goods   sold   increased   from   $5m   and   $3.9m   to   $45m   and   $37.7m,  respectively.   In addition,   Indmar’s   working   capital   (current   assets   minus  current   liabilities)   increased   from   $471,386   to $3.8m.   During   this period, Indmar   did not   declare   or   pay   formal   dividends.  Since   the   1970s,   Indmar’s   stockholders   have   advanced   funds   to   it,  receiving   a 10%   annual   return   in exchange.   Hoffman   started   the practice  in   the   1970s.   Beginning   in   1987,   the   Rowes   (as well   as   their   children)  began   to make   advancements   on   a periodic   basis.   Indmar   treated   all of the   advances   as   loans   from   stockholders   in   the   corporate   books   and  records,   and   made   monthly   payments   calculated   at   10%   of the   advanced funds.   Indmar   reported   the   payments   as   interest   expense   deductions   on  its federal   income   tax   returns.   Consistent   with   Indmar’s   reporting,   the  Rowes   reported   the   payments   as   interest   income   on   their   individual  income   tax   returns.  The   parties   did   not   initially   document   the   advances   with   notes   or other   instruments.   Beginning   in   1993,   the   parties   executed   notes  covering   all   of the   advances   at   issue.   Specifically,   Indmar   executed   a  promissory   note   in   1993   with   Donna   Rowe   for   $201,400   (.e.,   her  outstanding   balance).   The   note   was   payable   on   demand   and   freely  transferable,   had   no   maturity   date   or   monthly   payment   schedule,   and  had   a   fixed   interest   rate   of   10%.   In   1995,   Indmar   executed   a   similar  promissory   note   with   Richard   Rowe   for   $605,681   (.e.,   his   outstanding balance).   In   1998,   when   the   outstanding   transfers   totaled   $1,222,133, Indmar   executed   two   line   of credit   agreements   with   the   Rowes   for   $1m  and   $750,000.   The   line   of credit   agreements   provided   that   the   balances were   payable   on   demand   and   the   notes   were   freely   transferable.   In addition,   the   agreements   provided a stated   interest   rate   of 10%   and   had  no   maturity   date   or   monthly   payment   schedule.   None   of the   advances were   secured.  Repayments of  the advances   were   paid on demand, based on   the  needs of  the   stockholders,   and not   subject to   set   or predetermined due dates. The record   indicates   that between 1987   and   2000,   the total advance   balances   ranged   from   $634,000 to $1.7m,   and   Indmar   made purported interest payments   between   $45,000   and   $174,000   each year. The   parties   structured   the   advances as demand loans to give   the  Rowes flexibility   as   creditors.   Moreover, as demand loans,   the   advances  were   treated   by   the   Rowes as short-term   debt   under   Tennessee   law,

--- Page 200 ---

130  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  thereby   excepting interest payments from a 6% state tax on dividends and interest on long-term debts. * * * Indmar,   however, reported the advances as long-term liabilities on its financial statements to avoid violating   loan agreements with First Tennessee Bank (“FTB”), its primary creditor, who required a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities.  In order   to reconcile   the treatment   and   execution   of the   advances   as  demand   loans   versus   listing   them   as   long-term   debt   in   its   financial reports,   Indmar   received   waivers   from   the   Rowes   agreeing   to   forego  repayment   on   the   notes   for at least   12   months.   From   1989   to   2000,   the  notes   to Indmar’s   financial   statements   disclosed   that   “The   stockholders have   agreed   not   to demand   payment   within   the   next   year,”   and   in   1992 and   1993,   the   Rowes   signed   written   agreements   stating   that   they would  not   demand   repayment   of the   advances.   Indmar   did   all of this   under   the direction   of its accountant. Despite   the   annual   waivers,   the   Rowes   demanded   and   received  numerous   partial   repayments   of the   advances.   Specifically,   in   1994   and  1995,   Richard   Rowe   demanded   repayment   of   $15,000   and   $650,000,  respectively,   to   pay   his   taxes   and   purchase   a   new   home.   He   also  demanded   repayment   of   $84,948,   $80,000,   $25,000,   and   $70,221   from  1997-2000   to   pay   litigation   expenses,   boat   repairs,   and   tax   expenses.  Donna   Rowe   demanded   repayment   of $180,000   in 1998   for boat   repairs.  The   Rowes   made   additional   advances   in   1997   and   1998   of $500,000   and  $300,000,   respectively.   The   balance   of notes   payable   to   stockholders   on  December   31, 2000,   totaled   $1,166,912. As Indmar was a successful,   profitable company, numerous banks sought to lend money to it. FTB worked hard to retain Indmar’s business, made funds immediately available upon request, and   was willing to lend  Indmar   100% of the stockholder   advances. In its loan agreements with Indmar, FTB required the company to  subordinate all transfers, including   stockholder   advances, to FTB’s loans.  FTB did   not strictly enforce   the subordination provision, however, as  Indmar   repaid—with FTB’s knowledge—some of the stockholder advancements at the same time FTB loans remained outstanding.   As an example, when Richard demanded   repayment of $650,000 to purchase a new   home,   Indmar   borrowed the   entire amount from FTB at 7.5% (the  prime   lending rate was   8.75%). Indmar secured the   loan   with   inventory,  accounts   and   general   intangibles, equipment,   and the personal  guarantee of  the Rowes.   Richard   Moody, the FTB lending officer who  worked with Indmar on   the   loan,   testified   that   he knew   Indmar used the  proceeds to repay   Richard. Indmar   had   loans outstanding   with FTB at the time.  As   stipulated   by the   parties,   the prime   lending rate ranged   from a low   of 6% to a high   of  10.5%   between   1987-1998.   In   1997, Indmar   and FTB executed a promissory   note   for $1m that   was   modified   in  1998.   The  interest   rate   on   the   note   (7.85%)   was   below   the   prime   lending   rate.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  Indmar   also   had a collateralized   line   of credit   with   FTB.   Similar   to the  stockholder   advances,   the   bank   line   of credit   was   used   for   short-term  working   capital.   FTB   charged   the   following   rates   for the   secured   line   of  credit   [from   1995   to 2000,   the   rates   ranged   from 8 to 9.5   percent.   Ed.]:  B.   Claimed   Deductions   at Issue  On   its tax   returns   for 1998-2000,   Indmar   claimed   deductions   for the purported   interest   payments   paid   on   the   stockholder   advances.   The  Commissioner   issued   a notice   of deficiency.   Indmar   filed a petition   in the  Tax   Court   challenging   the   Commissioner’s   decision.   After   trial,   the   Tax Court   concluded   that   the   advances   did   not   constitute   genuine  indebtedness   and   thus   the   payments   to   the   stockholders   were   not  deductible.   The   Tax   Court   calculated   a   total   tax   deficiency   of $123,735  and   assessed   $24,747   in penalties.   Indmar   timely   appealed.  II.   LEGAL   ANALYSIS  A.   Determining   Whether   Advance   Is Debt   or   Equity.  * * * The   basic   question   before   us   is whether   the   advances   made   to  the   company   by   the   stockholders   were   loans   or   equity   contributions.  Under   26   U.S.C.   § 163(a),   a taxpayer   may   take   a tax   deduction   for “all interest   paid   or   accrued   ...   on   indebtedness.”   There   is   no   similar  deduction   for dividends   paid on   equity investments.   Thus,   if the advances  were   loans,   the   10%   payments   made   by   Indmar   to   the   Rowes   were  “interest”   payments,   and   Indmar   could   deduct   these   payments.   If, on   the  other   hand,   the   advances   were   equity   contributions,   the   10%   payments  were   constructive   dividends,   and   thus   were   not   deductible.  Over the   years, courts have   grappled with this seemingly simple question in a wide array of  legal and factual   contexts. The distinction  between debt and equity arises in other   areas of federal tax law, see, e.g.,  Roth Steel Tube Co. v. Comm’r, 800   F.2d 625, 629-30 (6th Cir.1986)  (addressing the   issue in the context of the   deductibility of advances as  bad debt under 26   U.S.C. § 166(a)(1)), as well as bankruptcy law * **  The   Second Circuit set out   the “classic” definition   of debt in Gilbert v. Commissioner: “an unqualified obligation to pay a sum certain at a reasonably close   fixed maturity date along   with a fixed percentage in interest payable   regardless of the   debtor’s income or lack   thereof.” 248  F.2d 399, 402   (2d   Cir.1957). “While   some variation   from this formula is  not fatal to the taxpayer's effort to have the advance treated as a debt for tax purposes, ... too great a variation will   of course   preclude   such  treatment.” Id. at 402-03.   The   question   becomes, then, what is “too great  a variation”?  To   determine   whether an advance to   a company is debt or equity, courts   consider   “whether the   objective   facts establish   an   intention to  create   an   unconditional   obligation to repay   the   advances.” * *  * In  doing so, courts   look   not   only to the   form   of   the   transaction,   but, more  importantly, to  its economic   substance.   See, e.g., Fin   Hay   Realty   Co. v.  United   States,   398   F.2d   694,   697   (3d Cir.1968)   (“The   various   factors .. .  131

132  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  are only aids in answering the ultimate   question whether   the investment, analyzed in terms of its economic reality, constitutes risk  capital entirely subject to the fortunes of the corporate venture or  represents a strict debtor-creditor relationship.”); Byerlite Corp. v. Williams,   286 F.2d 285, 291 (6th Cir.1960) (“In all cases, the prevailing consideration is that artifice must not be  exalted over reality, whether to the advantage of the taxpayer, or to the government.”).  The   circuit   courts   have   not   settled   on   a   single   approach   to   the  debt/equity   question.   We   elucidated   our   approach   in Roth   Steel,   setting  out   eleven   non-exclusive   factors   for courts   to consider:  (1) the   names   given   to the   instruments,   if any,   evidencing   the indebtedness;   (2) the   presence   or   absence   of a   fixed   maturity  date   and   schedule   of payments;   (3) the   presence   or   absence   of a  fixed   rate   of interest   and   interest   payments;   (4) the   source   of  repayments;   (5) the   adequacy   or   inadequacy   of capitalization; (6)   the   identity   of   interest   between   the   creditor   and   the  stockholder;   (7) the   security,   if any,   for   the   advances;   (8) the  corporation’s   ability   to   obtain   financing   from   outside   lending institutions;   (9)   the   extent   to   which   the   advances   were  subordinated   to the   claims   of outside   creditors;   (10)   the   extent to which   the   advances   were   used   to acquire   capital   assets;   and  (11)   the   presence   or   absence   of   a   sinking   fund   to   provide  repayments.  800   F.2d at 630. No single   factor is controlling;   the weight to be   given a  factor Gf any)   necessarily depends on the particular circumstances of  each case. * * *  B.   Standard   of Review  We review the Tax Court’s   factual findings for “clear   error” and its  application of law de novo. * *  * The circuits   are   split on whether the  debt/equity   question is one of fact or law, or   a mixed question of fact and law. * * * Earlier panels of  this court have held   that   the question is one of fact. * * * Accordingly,   we   review the Tax Court’s   findings for clear  error.  With these   principles in mind,   we now turn to the Tax Court’s  decision in  this   case.  C.   Roth   Steel   Factors  After   discussing   some,   but not all, of the Roth Steel   factors, the Tax Court   concluded that   the Rowes’   advances   were   equity   contributions. Specifically, it found the   following   factors weighed in favor of  equity: (i) Indmar did not pay   any   formal   dividends   (although this is not   one   of  the  Roth Steel   factors); (ii) there   was no   fixed maturity   date or obligation to  repay; (ill) repayment   came   from   corporate   profits and   would not   be  paid if there   were   not sufficient   profits;   (iv) advances   were   unsecured; (v) there was   no   sinking   fund;   and (vi)  at  the  time   advances   were   made,   there   was no   unconditional   and   legal   obligation   to   repay.   The   court   found   that

--- Page 203 ---

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  several   factors   weighed   in favor   of debt:   (i) Indmar   reported   the advances  on   its   federal   income   tax   returns   as   interest   expenses;   (ii)   external  financing   was   available;   (iii) Indmar   was   adequately   capitalized;   (iv) the  advances   were   not   subordinated   to   all creditors;   and   (v) the   Rowes   did not   make   the   advances   in proportion   to their   respective   equity   holdings.  The   court   concluded   that   the   factors   favoring   equity   certainly   outweigh  those   favoring   debt.   * * * As   explained   below,   we   find that   the Tax   Court  clearly   erred   in concluding   that   the   advances   were   equity   contributions  rather   than   bona   fide debt.   The   Tax   Court   failed to consider   several   Roth  Steel   factors.   It   also   did   not   address   in   its   analysis   certain  uncontroverted   testimony   and   evidence   upon   which   the   parties  stipulated.   Consideration   of all of the record   evidence   in this   case   leaves  us   “with   the   definite   and   firm   conviction   that   a   mistake   has   been  committed.”   Holmes,   184   F.3d   at 5438. 1.   Fixed   Rate   of Interest   and   Interest   Payments  The   first   factor   to   which   we   look   is whether   or   not   a fixed   rate   of  interest   and   fixed   interest   payments   accompanied   the   advances.   * * *  The   absence   of   a   fixed   interest   rate   and   regular   payments   indicates equity;   conversely,   the   presence   of   both   evidences   debt.   **™*   In   its findings   of fact, the   Tax   Court   determined   that   the   advances   were   made  with   a   10%   annual   return   rate.   The   court   also   found   that   Indmar   made  regular   monthly   interest   payments   on   all of the   advances.   The   fixed   rate  of interest   and   regular   interest   payments   indicate   that   the   advances  were   bona   fide   debt.   In   its   analysis,   however,   the   Tax   Court   took   a  different   view.   Rather   than   analyzing   these   facts   within   the   Roth   Steel framework   (i.e.,   as   objective   indicia   of debt   or   equity),   the   Tax   Court focused   instead   on   why   the   Rowes   made   the   advancements:   it concluded  that   the   Rowes   “characterized   the   cash   transfers   as   debt   because   they  wanted   to receive   a   10-percent   return   on   their   investment   and   minimize  estate   taxes.”   * * *   Yet,   neither   of these   intentions   is inconsistent   with  characterizing   the   advances   as   loans. For tax purposes, it is generally more   important to focus   on “what was done,” than “why it was done.” United States v. Hertwig,   398   F.2d 452, 455 (5th  Cir.1968). “In applying the law to the facts   of this case, ...  it  is ‘clear that the objective   factors . . . are decisive in cases   of  this type.”  Raymond, 511   F.2d at 191   (quoting  Austin Village, 432   F.2d at  745). It  is largely unremarkable that   the Rowes   wanted to receive a return   from their advances.   Most, if not all, creditors   (as  well as equity   investors) intend to profit from their investments.   Bordo Prods. Co. v. United States,   201 Ct.Cl.   482, 476   F.2d   1312,   1322 (1973). As  long as the interest rate is in  line with   the  risks  involved, a healthy   return on investment can  evidence debt. Of course,   “[e]xcessively   high   rates would ... raise   the   possibility  that a distribution   of  corporate   profits was   being   disguised as   debt. Were  such   the   purpose   of  an   exorbitant   interest   rate,   the   instrument   involved  would   probably   not   qualify   as   debt   in  form.”   Scriptomatic,   Inc. v. United  133

134 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  States, 555   F.2d 364, 370 n. 7  (3d Cir.1977) (citing William T. Plumb, Jr.,  The Fed. Income   Tax Significance of Corporate Debt: A Critical Analysis  &  A Proposal, 26 Tax L.Rev. 369, 439-40 (1971)). The   Tax Court found  that   the 10% rate exceeded the   federal prime interest rate during most of the period at issue, as well as the rate charged by FTB on several of its loans to Indmar.  The   record   indicates   that   the   10%   rate   was   not   an   “exorbitant interest   rate”   under   the circumstances.   Indmar   had a collateralized   line  of   credit   with   FTB,   which,   similar   to   the   stockholder   advances,   was  available   for short-term   working   capital.   The   rate charged   by FTB   for the line   of credit   ranged   between   8%—9.5%,   a rate   not   much   below   the   fixed  rate   of 10%   charged   by the   Rowes.   The   rate   differential   makes   financial sense   when   considering   the differences   in security—the   FTB   line of credit was   secured   while   the Rowes’   advances   were   not.2  As   for   the   Rowes’   desire   to   minimize   their   estate   taxes,   this   also  offers   little   to   the   analysis.   “Tax   avoidance   is   entirely   legal   and  legitimate.   Any   taxpayer   ‘may   so   arrange   his affairs   that   his taxes   shall be   as   low   as   possible;   he   is not   bound   to choose   that   pattern   which   will best pay   the Treasury;   there   is not   even   a patriotic   duty to increase   one’s taxes.’”   * * * The   desire   to avoid   or   minimize   taxes   is not   itself directly relevant   to the   question   whether   a purported   loan   is instead   an   equity investment.   Rather,   such   a desire   is only tangentially   relevant,   by acting  as a flag to the Commissioner   and courts   to look closely at the transaction  for any   objective   indicia   of debt. Far   from   proving the Commissioner’s position, the existence and consistent payment of a fixed, reasonable interest rate strongly supports  the inference that   the advances were bona fide loans.  2. Written Instruments of the Indebtedness  “The   absence of notes or other instruments of indebtedness is   a  strong   indication   that   the advances were capital contributions and not  loans.” * *  * In its analysis,   the Tax   Court   found that Indmar “failed to  establish that, at the time the transfers were made, it had the   requisite  unconditional   and legal obligation to repay the Rowes (e.g., the  transfers  were not documented).” *  * *  The   Tax   Court   focused on only half  the story. For   years 1987-1992, the Rowes did make   advancements without   executing   any notes or other instruments.   Beginning in 1993, and for all the  tax years at issue   in  this case, the parties executed notes   of loans and lines of credit covering all of  the advances at  issue, as the Tax   Court   noted in its findings of fact. Yet,  in its analysis of  the Roth Steel   factors,   the Tax   Court   was silent   as   to  2 The   government took   pains   during trial   to show that Indmar could have   received a lower   interest   rate from FTB than its stockholders. Had the 10% rate been exorbitant,   this would   have   been a useful line   of  inquiry. Under the circumstances here,   the   rate was not  exorbitant,   and   whether   Indmar could   have   received a better   rate through   FTB is  of no import.  To  show  bona fide debt, a taxpayer   does  not  need to prove   that it received   the financially  optimal rate,  Just a commercially   reasonable one.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  the   subsequent   execution   of notes.   After-the-fact   consolidation   of prior  advances   into   a   single   note   can   indicate   that   the   advances   were   debt  rather   than   equity   contributions.   * * * The   Tax   Court   erred   by focusing  on   the   initial   lack   of documentation   without   addressing   the   subsequent history   of executed   notes.  3.   Fixed   Maturity   Date   and   Schedule   of Payments “The   absence   of a fixed   maturity   date   and a fixed obligation   to repay  indicates   that   the   advances   were   capital   contributions   and   not   loans.”  * * *   Based   on   the   Rowes’   waivers,   the   Tax   Court   concluded   that   there  was   no   fixed   maturity   date   or fixed   obligation   to repay.   While   correct,   we  find that this factor   carries   little weight   in the final analysis.   The   parties  structured   the   advances   as   demand   loans,   which   had   ascertainable  (although   not   fixed)   maturity   dates,   controlled   by   the   Rowes.   * ** Furthermore,   the   temporary   waiver   of payment   does   not   convert   debt into   equity   “since   [the   stockholders]   still   expected   to   be   repaid.”   * * *  Where   advances   are   documented   by   demand   notes   with   a fixed   rate   of interest   and   regular   interest   payments,   the   lack   of a maturity   date   and  schedule   of   payments   does   not   strongly   favor   equity.   To   give   any significant   weight   to this factor   would   create   a virtual   per se rule against the   use   of   demand   notes   by   stockholders,   even   though   “[m]uch commercial   debt   is evidenced   by demand   notes.”   * * * 4.   The   Source   of Repayments  “An expectation of repayment solely from corporate earnings is not  indicative of bona fide debt regardless of its reasonableness.” * * * Repayment can generally come from “only four possible   sources . . . : (1)  liquidation of assets, (2) profits from the business, (3) cash flow, and (4)  refinancing   with another lender.” * * * The   Tax Court   found that   the “source of repayments” factor favored equity. It relied upon   Richard  Rowe’s   testimony that Indmar was   expected to make a profit and that  repayment “has to come from   corporate profits or else the company couldn’t pay for it.” *  * * The full colloquy from the testimony,   however,  is more equivocal:  Q. ... [A]t the time that you made these advances,   were   you  anticipating that   the repayment was   going to come   from   corporate  profits?  A.   Yes, sir. It has to come   from   corporate profits or else the  company couldn’t pay for it. Unless it made   profit—and I have   always believed   from the first day  we started,   that we   were   going to be  profitable. ~ Q. Was it your understanding   and intent,   at the   time   you made these   advances,   that if the company was not,  in fact, profitable,   you  would not   be  repaid?  A. Thad no   intentions   of  not  being   repaid, sir.  Q.   Why   is that?  A.   Ibelieve it’s me. It’s my   personality.  135

136   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Q.   Is that   because   you   intended   to make a profit?  A.   Yes,   sir.  There   are   at   least   two   plausible   ways   to   read   this   testimony.   One can   read   it the way   the Tax   Court   apparently   did—Rowe’s   testimony   was, at best,   contradictory:   repayment   must   come   from   profits,   but   he had   no  intention   of not being repaid,   regardless   of the company’s   fortunes.   Given the   apparent   contradiction,   one   should   focus   on   the   statement   against Indmar’s   interest:   Rowe   admitted   that   repayment   of the   advances   “has to come   from   corporate   profits   or else   the company   couldn’t   pay   for it.” If repayment   “has”   to   come   from   profits,   then   this   would   imply   that repayment   was   tied   to the   company’s   fortunes,   suggesting   the   advances  were   equity   contributions.  Another   way   to read   the testimony,   however,   is that   Rowe,   as a small  businessman   and   unsecured   creditor,   believed   that   full repayment   of all  of   Indmar’s   debt   required   a   thriving,   successful   business,   which,  ultimately,   required   profits.   In   other   words,   struggling   companies   near  or   at bankruptcy   do not   repay   their   debts,   at least   not   dollar   for dollar.  Under   this reading,   his testimony   is consistent   with   debt.   * * * If there was no other evidence to support one view or the   other, we  could not say   that   the Tax Court’s reading   was clearly erroneous.  Credibility determinations are left to the fact finder, and our review on  appeal is strictly limited. The “Tax   Court ‘is not bound to accept testimony at face value   even when it is uncontroverted if it is improbable, unreasonable or questionable.’” Lovell & Hart, Inc. v. Comm’r, 456   F.2d  145, 148 (6th Cir.1972)   (quoting Comm’r v. Smith,   285   F.2d 91, 96   (5th Cir.1960)). On the   other hand, the Tax Court   cannot ignore   relevant evidence in making its factual findings and   any inferences from those findings.  Here,   there is undisputed   testimony   by Rowe and the FTB lending officer, corroborated by stipulated   evidence in the   record,   that   clearly  weighs in favor of debt on this  factor. Indmar repaid a significant portion of the unpaid advances—$650,000—not from profits but by taking on additional   debt from   FTB.   While the   interest rate   on   the FTB loan was  lower   than   10%, Indmar had to secure   the bank loan with   inventory,  accounts   and   general   intangibles, equipment,   and   personal   guarantees. Thus, Indmar repaid a significant   portion of the unsecured   stockholder  advancements   by   taking on secured   debt from a bank,   rather than   by taking the funds directly from   earnings.   This is important   evidence that  the   parties had no expectation   that Indmar   would   repay the advances  “solely” from   earnings. The   Tax   Court did   not   discuss or even cite   this  evidence in its Roth Steel   analysis.  5. The Extent to Which the Advances   Were   Used to Acquire   Capital Assets Nor did the   Tax   Court   address   whether   Indmar   used   the   advances for working   capital   or  capital   expenditures.   “Use   of  advances to meet   the

--- Page 207 ---

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  daily operating   needs   of the corporation,   rather   than   to purchase   capital  assets,   is   indicative   of   bona   fide   indebtedness.”   ***   Richard   Rowe  testified   that   Indmar   always   went   to   a   bank   for   funds   to   buy   capital  equipment.   He   also   testified   that   all of the   advances   he made   to Indmar  were   used   for working   capital,   as   opposed   to capital   equipment.   This   is  uncontroverted   testimony.   The   government   points,   however,   to   Rowe’s  testimony   that   he   advanced   funds   even   when   Indmar   did not   “need”   the  funds,   and   argues   that   this   somehow   cuts   against   his testimony   that   the advances   were   used   as   working   capital.   The   government’s   argument   is unpersuasive.   We   do not   find   that   Rowe’s   testimony   on   this   subject   was  “improbable,   unreasonable   or   questionable,”   especially   in the   absence   of the Tax   Court   addressing   this factor in its analysis.5 A review   of Indmar’s  financial   statements   shows   that   it used   all   of the   funds   it received   in various   ways,   including   working   capital   and   capital   equipment expenditures.   Thus,   Indmar   used   the   advances   it   received   from   the Rowes,   even   if not   immediately   upon   receipt—i.e.,   Indmar   identified   a  “need”   for   the   advances   at   some   point.   There   is nothing   specific   in the  record,   including   Indmar’s   financial   statements,   that   suggests   the  advances   went   to purchase   capital   equipment   as   opposed   to being   used for working   capital.   Accordingly,   the   government’s   supposition   does   not  counter   Rowe’s   testimony,   and   this   factor   squarely   supports   a finding   of  debt.  6.   Sinking   Fund “The failure to establish a sinking   fund for repayment is evidence  that the advances were capital contributions   rather than loans.” Id. The Tax Court   was correct to point out that   the   lack of a sinking   fund favors  equity. This factor does not, however, deserve significant weight   under  the circumstances. First, a sinking   fund (as a type of reserve) is a form of  security for debt, and the Tax Court also counted the general   absence of security for the stockholder advances as favoring equity. Second, the  presence or absence of a sinking   fund is an important consideration when looking at advances made to highly  leveraged firms.   In that case, the risk  of repayment will likely be high on any unsecured loans, so any commercially reasonable lender would require a sinking   fund or some other form of security for repayment. Where a company has sound capitalization   with   outside   creditors ready to loan it money (as   here),  there is less need for a sinking fund. ***.  7. The Remaining Roth Steel Factors  On the remaining   Roth Steel   factors,   the Tax   Court   determined that  one   favored   equity (lack   of  security for the advances)   and four favored debt   (the company   had sufficient   external   financing   available to it; the  5 Asthe   Tax   Court did not  address this factor, it made no  credibility determinations   with  respect to Richard   Rowe’s   testimony   relating to the  use   of  the advancements.   At  one   point in its decision   the   Tax   Court   did   find   that   Rowe’s   testimony   was   “contradictory,   inconsistent, and  unconvincing”   and   that   the parties   “manipulated facts,”  but  this  was   in specific   reference to  its discussion   about   the inconsistent   treatment   of the  advances as demand   debt  and long-term   debt.  137

138  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  company was adequately capitalized;   the advances were not subordinated to all creditors; and the Rowes did not make the advances  in proportion to their respective   equity holdings). These findings are well-  supported in the   record. 8.   Failure   to Pay   Dividends  The   Tax   Court   included   in its discussion   of Roth   Steel   a factor   not  actually cited in that case—Indmar’s   failure   to pay   dividends.   In support, the   Tax   Court   cited   our   decision   in   Jaques   v.   Commissioner.   The relevance   of Jaques   to this   case   is questionable.   That   case   involved   the withdrawal   of funds   by   a   controlling   stockholder   from   his   closely-held  corporation.   The   stockholder   argued   that   the   withdrawal   itself   was   a  loan.   We   rejected   the   argument,   relying   in   part   on   the   fact   that   the  corporation   had   never   issued   a formal   dividend,   and   thus   the withdrawal  could   have   been   a disguised   dividend.   Jaques,   935   F.2d   at   107-08.   The  situation   here   is the   exact   opposite—the   stockholders   were   advancing money   to the corporation   (not from),   and   it is the nature   of those   advances  that   we   must   determine. Had   the Rowes   charged   Indmar   an   exorbitant   interest   rate,   the lack  of any   formal   dividends   might   have   been   relevant   to   showing   that   the payments   were   not   interest   payments,   but   disguised   dividends.   As   this  was   not   the   case,   see   supra   Section   II.C.1,   we   do not   address   further   the  relevance,   if any,   of the   lack   of dividend   payments   to   the   debt/equity question   presented   here.  D. The   Tax Court Committed Clear   Error  To summarize, eight of the eleven Roth Steel   factors favor debt. The  three remaining factors suggest the advances were equity,   but, as we explained above, two of the factors—the   absence of a fixed maturity date and   schedule of payments and the absence of a sinking fund—deserve little weight   under the facts   of  this   case. Moreover, the non-Roth Steel factor   relied upon   by the Tax Court—Indmar’s failure to pay dividends— has questionable   relevance to our   inquiry. The only factor weighing in favor of equity   with   any real significance—the lack   of security—does not outweigh all of  the other factors   in favor of debt. Accordingly, the trial evidence, when reviewed as   a whole, conclusively shows that   the Rowes’   advances to Indmar were   bona fide loans. The   Tax   Court committed clear   error   in finding   otherwise.  III. CONCLUSION ‘  For  the foregoing   reasons,   we   reverse   the Tax Court’s determination that   the   stockholders’ advances   were   equity   contributions. We find   that the advances   exhibited clear, objective   indicia   of bona fide   debt.  Accordingly,   we also reverse   the Tax   Court’s assessment of accuracy-  related   penalties.  = ROGERS,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE,   concurring.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  I concur   fully in the   majority   opinion.   I write   separately   to explain why   the   legal,   non-factual   components   of the   tax   court’s   analysis   are properly   examined   on   appeal   without   deference   to   the   tax   court,  notwithstanding   the   overall   “clearly   erroneous”   standard   that   our   court has   stated   to be applicable   to the   determination   of whether   a particular  transaction   is   debt   or   equity.   [Judge   Rogers   went   on   to   discuss   the conflicting   precedents   on   the   standard   of review   and   concluded   that, when   the   underlying   facts   are   not   in dispute,   an   appellate   court   should not   apply   the   clearly   erroneous   standard   to   the   debt   vs.   equity   issue,  which   is   a   mixed   question   of   fact   and   law.   Ed.]   Applying   “clearly erroneous”   deference   to lower   court   legal determinations,   no   matter   how hidden   or   embedded   such   determinations   are   in overall   determinations that   are   partly   or even   largely   factual,   is fundamentally   at odds   with   the  rule   of law.  = MOORE,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE,   dissenting.

HYBRID   INSTRUMENTS  The   types   of   financial   instruments   available   to   investors   have proliferated.   As   one   commentator   has   described   the   reality   of today’s world   of corporate   finance,   “[i]n   exchange   for   capital,   corporations   can  offer   investors   any   set   of rights   that   can   be   described   by words,   subject  to   any   conceivable   set   of   qualifications,   and   in   consideration   of   any conceivable   set of offsetting   obligations.”4  The flexibility afforded   corporate issuers has   contributed to an array  of exotic products that seek “best  of both   worlds” treatment—e., debt for  tax purposes   and equity for regulatory, financial rating, and   accounting purposes. These   hybrid instruments   have   been created and marketed   by  large   financial   institutions and   Wall Street law firms who have   advised corporate issuers   that they may deduct the   “interest” paid on the purported debt   while   treating the instruments as equity for financial  statement or regulatory   purposes. The excerpt   below,   from a study by the Joint Committee on Taxation on   the   tax treatment of business debt,  surveys   some of the  incentives to create hybrid   instruments.  a En   eer es a  1 Indeed, commentators have   expressed   concern that   there is no predictable legal distinction between loans to a business   and   equity   investment,   and that   the unpredictability of this   legal  distinction is partially caused   by the issue being   “treated as one   of  fact to be  resolved  by  applying   vague   standards. . . ”  See Stephen A.

140   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Joint   Committee   on   Taxation,   Present   Law  and   Background   Relating   to the   Tax  Treatment   of Business   Debt* July 11, 2011 (JCX-41-11), 80-85.  3.   Incentives   to   create   hybrid   instruments In general Taxpayers   have   significant   flexibility   to create   economically   similar  instruments   and   categorize   them   as   debt   or   equity.   In   general, instruments   are   not   bifurcated   into   part   debt   and   part   equity,   and   the categorization   as   one   type   of instrument   or   the   other   applies   across   the board   for   all   tax   purposes.   Taxpayers   may   have   incentives   to   create  instruments   with   hybrid   features,   that   is, having   features   of both   debt  and   equity,   either   solely   for Federal   income   tax   purposes,   or   because   of additional   benefits   that   may   occur   if the   instrument   is classified   in   a different   manner   for   other   purposes   such   as   financial   reporting,  regulatory   capital,   or foreign   tax   purposes. For example, issuers may seek to structure an instrument offering  many of the attributes of equity   while still providing an   interest deduction. Some investors may seek debt-like protections   while allowing  for the possibility  of sharing in the earnings or appreciation of a business. [If] instruments characterized as debt for tax purposes contain  significant equity like features,   the economic risks   of high  leverage might  be   mitigated.   For example, a debt instrument   having a long term that  permits deferral of cash interest or principal payments, or an instrument  that   allows final payment of interest or principal (or both) in an amount  of issuer   stock rather than cash, may provide some   cushion   against an issuer’s default and   bankruptcy. Similarly,   debt instruments held by a  shareholder of the   issuer   could   be perceived by third   parties as equity- like  to the  extent   the debt-holding   stockholders are   less likely to exercise their rights as creditors and drive a troubled issuer into bankruptcy.  Such   shareholders   might instead   voluntarily   cancel or restructure their debt to avoid bankruptcy and   preserve the   potential for the corporation  to improve its performance   and   ultimately   increase their   overall return  through their return to equity.  To the   extent   debt   provides interest deductions   but also some  flexibility against   causing bankruptcy   and lacks covenants that   inhibit  operations, it might be viewed in the marketplace as creating a  less risky  capital   structure   than other, more restrictive   debt.  ***  Corporate interest deductions on   certain hybrid   instruments  A corporation   may issue   debt   that is convertible to corporate   equity. Such an instrument   could   be  viewed as part   debt   and   part   equity,   with  ere   eee  * Some   footnotes   have   been   omitted,   and   others   have   been   renumbered.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  the   amount   paid to the corporation   being   attributable   in part to the fixed  interest   debt   instrument,   and   in part to the conversion   feature.   Treasury  regulations   and   rulings   provide   inconsistent   results   for similar   types   of  instruments,   depending   upon   how   the   conversion   feature   is structured. If an   instrument   is simply   convertible   into   stock   of the   issuer   or related  party,   the   amount   of   the   interest   deduction   that   is   considered   the economic   equivalent   of   a   payment   on   the   amount   attributable   to  conversion   features   is denied.  Under   an   IRS   ruling,!   if   the   instrument   is   not   automatically  convertible   at a specific price, but rather   is convertible   only if one   or more  contingencies   is satisfied   (e.g., only if corporate   earnings   or   share   prices  change   by a specified   threshold   amount),   then   the   rules   for determining  the   market   comparable   for   interest   deduction   purposes   allow   the  instrument   to be   treated   as   if it did   not   have   a conversion   feature,   thus  allowing   more   interest   to   be   deducted   in   advance   of actual   payment.  Depending   on   the   point   at   which   the   fixed   conversion   price   is   set  compared   to the conditions   of the contingency,   the two   instruments   could  be economically   very   similar.   The   IRS   has   solicited comments   on whether  the   approach   allowing   deductible   interest   to be   determined   as   if there were   no   contingency   should   be   extended   beyond   contingent   convertible bonds.   Commentators   have   expressed   different   views   and   have   noted  other   inconsistencies   in the treatment   of potentially   similar   instruments that offer a debt holder   the opportunity   to participate   in corporate   growth  or appreciation.   The   inconsistencies   in treatment   may   allow   taxpayers   to  select   the   treatment   most   favorable   by   proper   structuring   of   the  investment.  A corporation also may issue debt   that is under certain  circumstances   payable in corporate equity. Section 163(/) denies interest  deductions for such   instruments.   The   IRS has ruled   that   certain hybrid instruments are not within the   scope of this denial.” Advantages   when debt instruments for tax is treated as equity or part equity for financial   accounting,   rating agency or regulatory purposes  Federal   income tax is not   the   only context in which classification   of  an instrument as debt or equity   has significance. And because classification   rules applicable in  different contexts vary, taxpayers   have  designed   hybrid   instruments to achieve different, advantageous results  under the   different rules. Examples of other   contexts   include rules under U.S. GAAP determining the treatment of instruments for financial  accounting   purposes, bank regulatory rules determining   whether an instrument qualifies as equity   capital for purposes of bank capital requirements   and the   rules   of various   rating   agencies   considering how an instrument is treated for purposes of  financial   tests  in assigning credit  ratings to  issuers.

142  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  purposes is  a factor in the Federal income tax classification analysis, it is not determinative. Trust   preferred   securities?   are   an   example   of a   hybrid   securities  instrument   developed,   and   adapted   over   time,   to be classified   differently for tax, financial   accounting,   regulatory   or rating   agency   purposes.   Trust  preferred   securities   are   an   instrument   used   to raise   capital involving   the creation   of an   additional   entity to stand   between   the   corporation   raising  the   funds   and   the   investors   in   the   instrument.4   For   example,   a  corporation   interested   in   raising   capital   could   issue   debt   or   preferred stock directly to investors.   As an   alternative,   in the case   of trust   preferred securities,   a corporate   issuer   forms   a passthrough   entity by contributing  capital in exchange   for a common   equity interest.   The   passthrough   entity  then   sells preferred   equity   interests   to investors.   The   passthrough   entity  then   lends   the   money   it received   from   the   corporation   (as   a   capital  contribution)   and   the   investors   (in   exchange   for-the   preferred   equity  interests)   back   to the   corporation.   As   a result,   the   corporation   has   funds raised   from   investors,   and   has   an   obligation   to   make   payments   on  indebtedness   to the   newly   created   passthrough   entity.   Payments   on   the  corporation—passthrough   entity   indebtedness   are   typically   designed   to match   the   payments   required   on   the   passthrough   entity-investor  preferred   securities.   In other   words,   the   passthrough   entity   operates   as a conduit   to receive   payments   of interest   from   the   corporation,   which   it  pays   on   to its preferred   interest   holders. Prior to changes in the   financial accounting rules in 2003,   the  simplified   structure described   above   allowed the corporation interest  deductions on amounts paid through to the investors for Federal tax  purposes   without treating the arrangement as a liability   for financial  accounting purposes.   For Federal income tax purposes, the   debt between  the corporate issuer and the passthrough entity was   designed to qualify  as debt. Similarly,   the terms of the preferred interests issued to investors was   designed to qualify as debt for Federal income tax purposes even if  treated as issued by the corporate issuer directly. Under U.S. GAAP  rules, the passthrough entity was   consolidated   with the corporate issuer,  with the effect that   the   loan between the corporate issuer and the  passthrough entity (which would be treated as   a liability   for GAAP) was ignored for financial accounting   purposes,   and the preferred securities were   treated as issued directly by the corporation. These   preferred securities were   designed to qualify as equity for GAAP purposes.  ee   eS   ee  * The   term “trust preferred securities” as used in this pamphlet is  a generic term for various, but similar,   financial products   including monthly   income   preference   shares (MIPS) trust originated   preferred   securities (TOPrS),   quarterly   income   preference   shares (QUIPS),  trust   preferred   securities (TruPS),   and   more recent   variants   such as enhanced capital  advantaged preferred   securities (ECAPS) and Enhanced   TruPS   (ETruPS). See ihe   additional  entity can   be a foreign limited liability company, a domestic   partnership  or state law trust. Different   structures   have   used   different   entities   for   a variety   of non-tax  reasons   over   time   including   compliance   with   securities   laws,   transaction   costs and   investor  convenience,

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  In   2003,   U.S.   GAAP   rules   were   revised   to   require   that   trust  preferred   securities   be   reflected   as   a   liability   for   financial   accounting  purposes.   However,   the   trust   preferred   security   structure   has   also involved   benefits   for   credit   rating   purposes.   Very   generally,   rating  agencies   such   as Moody’s   Investor   services   and   Standard   and   Poor’s   may  assign   a   credit   rating   to   certain   company   instruments.   These   agencies  are   concerned   primarily   with   a company’s   ability   to make   payments   on  an   instrument   as   required,   without   default.   An   important   component   of  such   an   analysis   is the   composition   of the   issuer’s   capital   structure,   and the   degree   of flexibility   a company   has   in periods   of impaired   cash   flow. For   example,   Moody’s   Investor   Services’   rules   have   granted   partial  “equity   credit”   to   hybrid   instruments   that   allow,   like   trust   preferred  securities,   for the   deferral   of periodic   payments.   In effect,   giving   “equity  credit”   for   hybrid   instruments   could   make   such   instruments   more attractive   to issuers   than   other   financing   alternatives,   especially   if such credit   improved   the   company’s   credit   rating. In addition   to credit   rating   benefits,   for an   issuer   of trust   preferred securities   that   is   a bank   holding   company,   such   securities   were   designed to   count   as   Tier   1 regulatory   capital.   Very   generally,   under   U.S.   bank regulatory   capital   requirements,   banks   are   required   to   hold   some minimum   level   of capital   (e.g., three   percent   of total   assets)   and   satisfy a  minimum   risk-based   capital   ratio   (e.g.,   a   ratio   of total   capital   to   total  risk-weighted   assets   of eight   percent).   These   requirements   are   generally  designed   to insure   banks   hold   capital   sufficient   to absorb   potential   losses.  Debt   issued   directly   by a bank   could   give rise   to tax   deductible   interest  payments,   but   would   not   qualify   as   capital   for   regulatory   purposes.  Preferred   stock   issued   directly by the bank   could   count   as equity   capital,  but   generally   would   not   give   rise   to   interest   deductions.   For   certain  banks,   specifically,   bank   holding   companies   regulated   by   the   Federal Reserve   Board,   trust   preferred   securities   meeting   certain   requirements  counted   as   Tier   1 capital.   For banks   other   than   bank   holding   companies,  trust   preferred   securities   did   not   count   as   Tier   1 capital.   Section   171(b)  of the   Dodd-Frank   Wall   Street   Reform   and   Protection   Act   generally  phases   out   the   treatment   of trust   preferred   securities   as   Tier   1 capital  for most   large bank   and   thrift holding   companies.  KK*  3.   SECTION   385  Code:   § 385. Background. Many years ago, Congress   concluded that a determined  effort was   needed to alleviate   the   uncertainties   flowing   from the  debt/equity   case   law,   especially   in light of “the increasing   use   of  debt for  143

144  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  corporate acquisition purposes.”6 F rustrated in its attempt to draft  precise definitions, Congress delegated the chore to the executive branch  by enacting Section 385, which authorizes the Treasury to promulgate  such   regulations “as may be necessary or appropriate” to determine for  all tax purposes whether an interest in a corporation is to be treated as  stock or debt. Section   385(b) requires the regulations to  set forth “factors”  to be taken into account in determining whether a debtor-creditor  relationship exists and specifies the following factors which may (but  need not) be included in the regulations: (1)   Form—i.e.,   whether   the   instrument   is   evidenced   by   a  written,   unconditional   promise   to   pay   a   sum   certain   on  demand   or   on   a   specific   date   in   return   for   an   adequate consideration   and   bears a fixed   interest   rate.  (2)   Subordination   to any   indebtedness   of the corporation.  (3)   The   debt/equity   ratio. (4)   Convertibility   into   stock.  (5)   Proportionality—i.e.,   the   relationship   between   holdings   of stock   in the corporation   and   holdings   of the purported   debt  interest   being   scrutinized.  The   Regulations   Project.   Section   385   was   hailed   by   leading  commentators   as   “perhaps   the   most   important   and   potentially   far- reaching   corporate   provision   added   by the Tax   Reform   Act of 1969,”66   and  the   literature   was   replete   with   predictions   as   to   the   content   of   the regulations.§7   In   March,   1980,   11   years   after   Section   385   was   enacted,  the Treasury   issued   a lengthy,   detailed   and   controversial   set of proposed  regulations.®8   “Final”   regulations   were   promulgated   in   December,  1980,6   followed   by   amendments   and   effective   date   extensions,   but   all versions   of the regulations   were   withdrawn   in 19837   and   the project has  since   been   abandoned.  Although a detailed examination of the now long defunct   regulations would not be   productive, some features are noteworthy if only because they  represented a concentrated   attempt to bring   order out   of the   chaos.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  instruments,   appropriately   relegating   hybrid   securities   to   second   class  status.   A “hybrid”   was   defined   as   an   instrument   convertible   into   stock   or  providing   for   any   contingent   payment   to   the   holder.7?   In   virtually   all cases,   hybrids   would   have   been   treated   as   preferred   stock   for   tax  purposes,   at   least   if they   were   not   held   by   independent   creditors.78  Straight   debt—defined   as   anything   other   than   a hybrid   instrument74— still   had   a   fighting   chance   of avoiding   reclassification   if-certain   other  requirements   were   met. The   concept   of proportionality   played   a central   role in the regulatory scheme   because   “it generally   makes   little economic   difference   (aside from  tax consequences)   whether   proportionate   shareholder   advances   are   made  as   debt   or   equity   * * * .”75 Elaborate   definitions   of proportionality   were  provided,   and   special   scrutiny   was   required   for   instruments   held   in  substantial   proportion   to equity   investments.76 Another   contribution   of the   regulations   was   their   precise   definition of   two   debt/equity   ratios—“outside”   (which   took   into   account   all  liabilities,   including   those   to   independent   creditors)   and   “inside”  (considering   only   shareholder   debt).77   Corollary   rules   provided   that  assets   were   to   be   reflected   at   adjusted   basis   rather   than   fair   market value   and   trade   liabilities   were   to be disregarded.78   The   debt/equity   ratio was   used   to   determine   whether   a corporation’s   debt   was   “excessive”.   A  debt   was   excessive   if the   instrument’s   terms   and   conditions,   viewed   in  combination   with   the   corporation’s   financial   structure,   would   not   have been   satisfactory   to a bank   or other   financial   institution   making   ordinary  commercial   loans.7?   It   was   not   excessive,   however,   if   the   outside  debt/equity   ratio   did   not   exceed   10-to-1   and   the   inside   debt/equity   ratio  did not   exceed   3-to-1.89   Thus,   even   proportionate   straight   debt   issued   for  cash   would   not   be   reclassified   if it fell   within   this   safe   harbor   from “excessive   debt”   and   bore   a   “reasonable”   (within   specified   ranges)  interest   rate.   Variations   on   these   themes   abounded.  The regulations   were withdrawn because lobbyists convinced the Treasury that they would   have a negative impact on particular   industries  72   Prop.   Reg.   § 1.385—3(d).  73   Prop.

In  general,   proportional straight   debt instruments were   treated  ‘as debt   only if issued to “independent creditors” or if they were marketable   instruments issued  by a public company; otherwise   they   generally   were reclassified as equity   unless   they were: (a)  issued for cash or,  if issued for property,   the   stated annual interest   rate was   “reasonable,”   and  (b) the   corporation did not have   “excessive   debt”   at the  time   the instrument   was issued.

146  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  and on small businesses generally.8! Although some of the regulatory themes ultimately may be adopted by the courts, the Treasury is unlikely to initiate the mobilization that would be required to resurrect this project. Bifurcation   of Instruments.   Despite   the Treasury’s   lack   of success   in implementing   the   goals   of Section   385,   Congress   has   not   given   up   hope. Section   385   was   amended   to   allow   (but   not   require)   the   Treasury   to classify   an   interest   having   significant   debt   and   equity   characteristics   as “in   part   stock   and   in part   indebtedness.”82   According   to   the   legislative  history,   bifurcation   may   be   appropriate   where   a   debt   instrument  provides   for   payments   that   are   dependent   to   a   significant   extent   on  corporate   performance,   such   as   through   “equity   kickers”   (i.e., provisions in a debt   instrument   that   provide   the   holder   with   an   equity   interest   in certain   circumstances),   contingent   interest   (which   is   dependent   on corporate   performance),   significant   deferral   of payment,   subordination, or an   interest   rate   high enough   to suggest   a significant   risk of default.83 If the   Treasury   ever   accepts   this   Congressional   challenge,   several options   could   be   considered.   One   approach   would   disallow   interest deductions   in excess   of a specified rate of return   to investors   on the theory  that   a higher   than   normal   risk   is tantamount   to an   equity   investment.  For   example,   the regulations   might   specify   a reference   rate   (such   as   the  rate on comparable-term   Treasury   obligations)   that is relatively   risk-free and   permit   interest   paid   up   to   that   rate   to   be   deductible   but   deny   a  deduction   for the   additional   “risk”   element   because   it is more   akin   to   a  dividend.   Under   this   type   of broad   disallowance   approach,   a corporation that   issued   a   20-year   $100,000   unsecured   debt   instrument   paying   14 percent   interest   (14,000   per   year)   at a time   when   comparable   Treasury bonds   were   yielding   10   percent   would   be   permitted   to   deduct   only $10,000   per year   as interest   and   the remaining   $4,000   per   year   would   be a nondeductible   dividend.84 Another option is  to limit bifurcation to instruments that provide for  a combination of a fixed return and an additional   return based on  earnings. The regulations might treat the fixed return as interest while classifying   the performance-based   component as   a _ nondeductible  dividend. A closely   related   alternative, which finds   isolated support in the   case   law, would be to divide   one instrument into separate  components—i.e., one   part as debt and   another as equity.85  *  51 See, e.g., Levin & Bowen, “The Section   385 Regulations   Regarding   Debt  Versus Equity:  Is the Cure   Worse than the Malady?” 35 Tax   Law. 1  (1981). 8 LR.C. § 385(a). This   regulatory   authority may be  exercised on a prospective basis   only.  83 H.Rep. No. 101-247, 101st   Cong., 1st Sess. 1236 (1989).  ; 84 In narrowly targeted   situations, Congress   began   moving in   this direction   with   the legislation enacted   in 1989. See, e.g., LR.C.   §§ 163(e)(5), (i). Query   whether   any   broader  approach   would   discriminate   against   start-up companies or firms engaged in high-risk businesses?  85 Two courts   have   used this approach   with   respect to hybrid   instruments.

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  Obligation   of Consistency.   Section   385(c)   provides   that   a corporate issuer’s   characterization   of an   instrument   as   debt   or   equity   at the   time  of issuance   shall be binding   on the issuer   and   all holders   of the interest—  but   not   binding,   of course,   on   the   Service.   This   rule   of consistency   does  not   apply,   however,   to holders   who   disclose   on   their   tax   return   that   they  are   treating   the   interest   in   a   manner   inconsistent   with   the   issuer’s characterization.  Recent   Section   385   Regulatory   Efforts.   In   April   2016,   the   Service  issued   proposed   regulations   under   Section   385   that   primarily   affected  the treatment   of indebtedness   between   related   parties for tax purposes.*6  The   proposed   regulations   were   intended   to   curb   what   the   Service  believed   to   be   certain   abusive   transactions   used   by   multinational corporations   to   shift   income   outside   the   United   States,   but   they potentially   had   a   broader   reach.   Highlights   included:   (1)   strict  documentation   and   other   procedural   requirements   that   must   be   met   as  a prerequisite   for treating   certain   related-party   transactions   as   debt;   (2)  a   new   per   se   rule   that   automatically   reclassifies   certain   related-party  transactions   as   equity   without   regard   to   the   multi-factor   tests   under  current   law;   and   (3) authorization   for the   Service   to treat   certain   related-  party   interests   as   part   debt   and   part   equity   based   on   the   “substance”   of the instrument. After   receiving   a   barrage   of critical   comments,   the   Service   issued much   narrower   final   and   temporary   regulations   in October   2016.87   One notable   change   that   is   easily   understood   was   the   removal   of   IRS authorization   to bifurcate   instruments   into part debt   and   part equity. The final and temporary regulations   were   met with   congressional criticism, and in 2017 the IRS   delayed application of the strict documentation regulations.8§   Later in 2017,   the Treasury   Department, as part of its effort to identify and reduce tax regulatory   burdens,  included the documentation regulations as  a candidate for revocation and  replacement   by a substantially streamlined   and simplified   version   with a delayed effective date to allow   time for comments and compliance.®9 The Future. Perhaps in the 22nd century, when   comprehensive Section   385   regulations are reissued, we will have   regulatory   guidance on   classification   of debt and equity.  PROBLEMS  1. Aristocrat, Baker   and   Chef have   formed   Chez   Guevara, Inc.

Commissioner, 279   F.2d   701   (2d Cir.1960).

TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  ~~  Km  cash, Baker will contribute a building   with a fair market value of $80,000 and an adjusted basis of $20,000, and   Chef will contribute $40,000 cash and  the goodwill from his proprietorship   with an agreed value of $40,000 and has  a zero   basis. In return, each of the parties will receive 100 shares of Chez common stock, the only class outstanding.  Chez   requires   at   least   $1,800,000   of   additional   capital   in   order   to renovate   the building,   acquire   new   equipment   and   provide   working   capital. It   has   negotiated   a   $900,000   loan   from   Friendly   National   Bank   on   the following   terms:   interest   will be payable   at two   points   above   the   prime   rate,  determined   semi-annually,   with   principal   due   in ten   years   and   the   loan   will  be secured   by a mortgage   on   the   renovated   restaurant   building.  Evaluate   the   following   alternative   proposals   for raising   the   additional $900,000   needed   to commence   business,   focusing   on   the   possibility   that   the Service   will reclassify   corporate   debt   instruments   as   equity:  (a)   Aristocrat,   Baker   and   Chef   each   will   loan   Chez   $300,000,   and  each   will   take   back   a   $300,000   five-year   corporate   note   with variable   interest   payable   at   one   point   below   the   prime   rate,  determined   annually.  (b)   Same   as   (a),   above   except   that   each   of the   parties   will   take back   $800,000   of   10%   20-year   subordinated   income debentures;   interest   will be payable   only out   of the   net   profits  of the business.  (c)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that   the   $900,000   loan   from  Friendly   National   Bank   will   be   unsecured   but   personally guaranteed   by Aristocrat,   Baker   and   Chef,   who   will be jointly  and   severally   liable.  (d) Aristocrat will loan   the   entire $900,000,   taking   back a  $900,000 corporate note with terms identical to those described in (a), above. (e) Same as (d), above,   except that commencing two   years after  the incorporation, Chez ceases to pay interest on the   notes  because   of a severe   cash   flow   problem.  2.   In view   of the   confused   state   of the   law,   how   should   a tax   advisor   plan  the   capital   structure   of a corporation   to avoid   the   risk   of reclassification   of debt   as   equity.   From   the   standpoint   of the   tax   advisor,   is the   vagueness   of the law in this area   preferable   to more   detailed   “bright line” rules in the Code  or regulations?   Which   approach   is preferable   as   a matter   of policy?  C. CHARACTER OF GAIN   OR   LOSS   ON CORPORATE INVESTMENT  Code:   §§ 165(g)(1), (2); 166(a), (a),  (e); 1244(a)—(c).

CHAPTER   3   CAPITAL   STRUCTURE  generally   is a   capital   gain   or   loss.9°   As   discussed   below,   the   Code   also  includes   a   few   special   characterization   rules,   some   to   stimulate  investment   and   others   to clarify   the   tax   treatment   of transactions   that  technically   do not   constitute   a “sale   or   exchange.” Gain   on   Sale   of Qualified   Small   Business   Stock.   To   encourage   long- term   investment   in smaller   start-up   companies,   Section   1202   generally  permits   noncorporate   shareholders   who   are   original   issuees   of stock   in a domestic   C corporation   to exclude   from   gross   income   100   percent   of the  gain from a sale   or   exchange   of “qualified   small   business   stock”   acquired  after   September   27,   2010   and   held   for   more   than   five   years.9!   The  exclusion   is available   to a shareholder   for up   to $10   million   of recognized  gain per   qualifying   corporation.®2   To   qualify   its stock   for this tax benefit,  the   issuer   generally   must:   (1) never   have   had   gross   assets   in   excess   of  $50   million   (including   the   proceeds   of the   newly   issued   stock) before   and  immediately   after   the   stock   is issued93;   (2) meet   certain   active   trade   or  business   requirements;94   and   (38)   not   violate   various   other   special  limitations,   including   restrictions   on   purchases   by the   corporation   of its own   stock.%   Another   valuable   tax   benefit   is provided   by   Section   1045,  which   allows   noncorporate   shareholders   to   elect   to   defer   otherwise taxable   gain   from a sale   of qualified   small   business   stock   held   for more  than   six   months   by   rolling   over   the   proceeds   into   new   qualified   small  business   stock   within   60 days   of the   sale. Worthless   Securities.   Even   the   most   optimistic   taxpayers   who  embark   on   a   business   venture   are   well   advised   to   anticipate   the   tax  consequences   if their   endeavor   should   result   in a loss.   Sole   proprietors, partners   (including   members   of   limited   liability   companies)   and shareholders   in   an   S   corporation   may   deduct   the   losses   from   their business   operations   as they   are   incurred   if they materially   participate   in the   activity.96   But   shareholders   or   creditors   of a C corporation   normally must   be content   to recognize   a capital   loss   at the   time   their   investment  is sold   or becomes   worthless.   If a loss   results   from   the   worthlessness   of  stock   or   debt   evidenced   by   a   “security”   which   is a   capital   asset,   the  90 In some cases, where the   original   issue discount and market discount rules apply, all  or part of the gain on the sale or maturity of a debt instrument may be ordinary   income.   See generally I.R.C. §§ 1271-1275.  2 ©6.R.C. § 1202(a)(1), (4). For qualified   stock acquired on or before September 27, 2010, a smaller percentage (50 or 75  percent) may be  excluded,   7 percent of  the excluded amount is an alternative minimum tax preference item, and the taxable   portion of “Section   1202 gain” is taxed  at a maximum rate   of 28 percent   rather than the generally   applicable long-term capital gains rate. ILR.C. §§ 1202(a)(3); 1(h)(4), (7). Certain   specialized   types of C corporations,   such as mutual  funds   and REITS, and   corporations engaging in certain   types of businesses (e.g., providing  professional services, banking,   farming,   natural   resources, and hotels)   do not   qualify for the  exclusion. I.R.C. § 1202(e)(3), (4).  9 T.R.C. § 1202(b)(1)(A).   In some situations   involving   larger   investors, higher limits may  apply.

150  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  calamity is treated as   a hypothetical sale or exchange on the last day of  the taxable   year in which the loss is incurred.97  Debts Not Evidenced by a Security. For noncorporate lenders,   the tax  consequences of losses sustained on a debt not evidenced by a security  are governed   by the bad debt deduction rules in Section 166. Business  bad debts are ordinary losses, while nonbusiness bad debts are artificially treated as short-term capital losses.98 When a shareholder  who is also an employee loans money to a closely held corporation and  later is not repaid,   an   issue   arises over whether the loan was made as an  investment or in a trade or business carried on by the taxpayer. The loss  almost always is treated as a nonbusiness bad debt on the theory that the dominant motivation for making the   loan was to protect   the  taxpayer’s investment in the corporation rather than his employment  relationship.  Section   1244   Stock.   As   discussed   above,   it is virtually   impossible   for  shareholders   to avoid   nonbusiness   bad   debt   treatment   if they   sustain   a  loss   in their   creditor   capacity.   Whatever   their   roles,   corporate   insiders  generally   are   regarded   as   investors.1°°   These   rules   place   corporate investors   who   suffer   losses   at   a tax   disadvantage   relative   to those   who conduct   their   affairs   through   other   business   vehicles.   In   the   case   of a  small   business,   this   dichotomy   makes   little   sense   and   may   prove   to be  particularly   unfair   to those   who   are   forced   into   the   C   corporation   form  for   nontax   reasons.   In   the   same   legislation   that   produced   the   earliest  version   of   Subchapter   S,   Congress   provided   some   limited   relief   by enacting   Section   1244   in order   to “encourage   the   flow   of new   funds   into small   business”   by placing   small   business   shareholders   on   more   of a par  with   proprietors   and   partners.1°!   If   certain   detailed   statutory  requirements   are   met,   an   individual   shareholder   may   (within   limits) treat   a   loss   from   the   sale,   exchange   or   worthlessness   of “Section   1244 stock”   as an   ordinary   loss even   if it might   otherwise   have   been   treated   as  a capital   loss. Because Section   1244   was   designed to stimulate investment in small businesses,   only   individual taxpayers   and   partnerships (but   not   trusts  and estates) who were original   issuees of the   stock are   eligible   for  ordinary loss treatment.102 Donees, heirs and other   transferees of the  97   See   I.R.C.   §§ 165(g)(1),   (2). 98   ~1.R.C.   § 166(a),   (d).

CHAPTER 3 CAPITAL STRUCTURE  original investor will continue to be   limited to capital loss treatment  under Section 165.  Section   1244   stock   may   be either   common   or preferred   stock   that has been   issued   for money   or property.193   Stock   issued   for services   thus   does not   qualify.104   To   prevent   the   benefits   of Section   1244   from   extending beyond   the   small   business   community,   its reach   is limited   to stock   of a “small   business   corporation,”   a status   achieved   if the   aggregate   amount of money   and   other   property   received   by the   corporation   for   stock,   as   a  contribution   to   capital   and   as   paid-in   surplus   does   not   exceed  $1,000,000.1   This   determination   is made   at the time   the stock   is issued,  but   the   $1,000,000   cap   includes   both   amounts   received   for   the   newly  issued   stock   and   any   stock   previously   issued   by the corporation. 196 Qualification   under   Section   1244   when   the   stock   is issued   does   not  automatically   guarantee   that an   ordinary   loss will be allowed   when a loss  is realized.   Section   1244(c)(1)(C)   also   requires   that,   for the   five   taxable years   ending   before   the   year   in   which   the   loss   was   sustained,   the corporation   must   have   derived   more   than   50   percent   of its   aggregate  gross   receipts   from   sources   other   than   passive   investment   income   items  (royalties,   rents,   dividends,   interest,   annuities   and   sales   or exchanges   of stock   or   securities).   The   requirement   is designed   to   preclude   ordinary loss   treatment   to   shareholders   of   corporations   engaged   primarily   in  investment   rather   than   active   business   activities.   If these   investment  losses   had   been   incurred   directly,   the   taxpayer   would   have   been   limited to capital   loss   treatment   and   the   corporate   form   should   not   facilitate   an  end   run   around   this   limitation.   If   the   loss   is   sustained   before   the  corporation   has   a five-year   measuring   period,   then   the gross   receipts   test is applied   by substituting   the taxable   years   ending   before   the   date   of the  loss   in which   the   corporation   was   in existence. 107  The   aggregate   amount   that   may   be   treated   by the   taxpayer   as   an ordinary   loss for any   one   taxable   year   may   not   exceed   $50,000   or, in the  case   of married   couple   filing   a joint   return,   $100,000.18   In   the   case   of  partnerships,   the   limit   is determined   separately   as to each   partner. 19 Section   1244 is  a “no lose” provision in the   sense   that nothing is  lost by passing a corporate   resolution   declaring that   an equity interest is being   issued as Section   1244 stock   even if the   stock ultimately fails   to qualify. Although there is no longer a requirement for a formal plan, it generally is regarded as good practice to include a reference to Section  103   T.R.C.   § 1244(c)(1)(B).  104   Reg.   § 1.1244(c)—1(d).  105   T.R.C.   § 1244(c)(8).  106 Id.

If the   capital   receipts exceed   $1,000,000,   the corporation may designate certain   shares as Section   1244   stock provided that   the amounts received for such   designated stock   do  not exceed   $1,000,000 less amounts received for stock or  as capital   contributions in  prior  years.  107   T.R.C.   § 1244(c)(2)(A). 108   J.R.C.   § 1244(b).  109   Reg.   § 1.1244(b)—1(a).  151

PROBLEM  High   Technologies,   Inc.   (“Hi-Tech”)   is   a small   semiconductor   company  owned   and   operated   by Thelma   High   and   Allen   Woody.   Thelma   and   Allen formed   Hi-Tech   as   a   C   corporation   three   years   ago   by   each   contributing  $400,000   in exchange   for 50 percent   of the   corporation’s   common   stock.   Hi- Tech   has   been   planning   a major   expansion   of its manufacturing   facility and has   decided   to seek   outside   financing.   It recently   approached   Jennifer   Leech about   the   possibility   of her   investing   $200,000   in Hi-Tech. After   investigating   the   corporation’s   financial   position,   Jennifer   has decided   to   make   the   investment.   Her   objectives   are   to   obtain   maximum  security   while   at the   same   time   participating   in Hi-Tech’s   potential   growth. Jennifer   also   is concerned   about   the   rapid   change   in computer   technology and   would   like   to   plan   for   the   most   favorable   tax   consequences   in   the unfortunate   event   that   her   investment   in   Hi-Tech   becomes   worthless.  Consider   to what   extent   Jennifer   will   realize   her   economic   and   tax   goals   if,  in the alternative,   her investment   takes   the following   forms:  (a)   A   $200,000   unregistered   five-year   Hi-Tech   note   bearing  market   rate   interest.  (b)   A   $200,000   Hi-Tech   registered   bond   bearing   market   rate  interest.  (c) A $190,000   Hi-Tech registered bond   bearing market rate  interest and   $10,000 for warrants to purchase   Hi-Tech  common stock at a favorable price. (d)   $200,000   of Hi-Tech   common   stock. (e)   $200,000   of Hi-Tech   convertible   preferred   stock. (f) Same as (d), above,   except Thelma and Allen   originally capitalized Hi-Tech   by each   contributing   $500,000. (g) Same as (d), above,   except   Jennifer   plans to give   the Hi-Tech  common stock to her son, Peter, as   a wedding gift.  (h) Same as (d), above,   except   Jennifer   and her son, Peter, will  purchase the Hi-Tech common stock through   Leech Associates, a venture capital partnership.

CHAPTER   4  NONLIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS  A.   INTRODUCTION 1.   DIVIDENDS:   IN GENERAL  Code:   §§ 243(a), (b)(1); 301(a), (€); 316(a);   317(a).  Regulations: §§ 1.301—1(c); 1.316—1(a)(1)—(2).  It has been said that a corporation derives no greater pleasure   than  through making distributions to its shareholders. As one   court observed,  “like the   ‘life-rendering pelican,’ [a corporation] feeds its shareholders  upon dividends.” In the case of a close corporation, however, this colorful marine analogy does not always capture reality. Closely   held companies,  influenced by the   federal tax law,   typically resist paying dividends and expend considerable   energy to avoid the   sting of the double tax. Many  public companies retain profits for internal expansion, to finance acquisitions, or   to repurchase their own stock.? But if an enterprise is successful,   the pressure may   mount to distribute earnings to the  shareholders,   and distributions often   occur in connection   with major  changes in a corporation’s capital   structure, such as liquidations,  mergers   and i eT ee Lo  classify   the   distribution as   a taxable   dividend of  capital, or   as gain from a sale of the shareholder’s stock. Simple as "Hs y   seem,   drawing   these   lines   has   been   a   central   issue   in   the  |  taxation   of   corporations   and   shareholders.   Not   surprisingly,   the  statutory   scheme   is complex   and   sometimes   even   illogical.  Distributions   come   in many   forms.   A corporation   may   distribute   its  own   stock   or   debt   obligations;   redeem   (i.e.,   repurchase)   stock   from   its shareholders   by distributing   cash   or property;   or distribute   its net   assets  in liquidation   of the   entire   business.   The   tax   consequences   of these   and  other   more   complex   transactions   are   considered   in later   chapters.?   This chapter   lays   a foundation   by examining   the   corporate   and   shareholder  level   tax   treatment   of nonliquidating   (or   “operating”)   distributions   of  cash   or property—distributions   commonly   referred   to as   “dividends.”   We  are   about   to   learn,   however,   that   not   all   distributions   classified   as  1   (Commissioner   v.

154  30)  Soy lQk)  Slele\-  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  dividends under state law or designated as such in the corporate minutes  are dividends for federal tax purposes. Determining the tax consequences of a nonliquidating distribution requires an excursion through several   sections of the Code.   Section   301  governs the amount and classification to corporate and noncorporate  shareholders of distributions of “property” made by a C corporation   with  respect to its stock.4 Under Section 301(c)(1), distributions that are  “dividends”   within the meaning of Section 316 must be included in gross income.’ In order to prevent multiple taxation, corporate shareholders  may deduct 50 percent (or sometimes 65 or 100 percent) of the dividends  they receive.6 Most dividends received by  noncorporate   shareholders are taxed at preferential long-term capital gains rates.7 Distributions that are not dividends are first treated as  a recovery of the shareholder’s basis in  his  stock, and any excess over   basis is treated as gain from the sale or  exchange of the stock.®  Section   316(a)   defines   a   “dividend”   as   any   distribution   of property made   by a corporation   to its shareholders   out   of (1) earnings   and   profits accumulated   after   February   28,   1913   (“accumulated   earnings   and  profits”)   or   (2) earnings   and   profits   of the   current   taxable   year   (“current  earnings   and   profits’).   “Earnings   and   profits,”   a   term   of   art   to   be  examined   in more   detail   below,   is a concept   that   attempts   to distinguish  distributions   of corporate   profits   from   returns   of capital.   Section   316(a) also   includes   two   irrebuttable   presumptions:   every   distribution   is deemed   to be   made   out   of earnings   and   profits   to the   extent   that   they exist   and   is   deemed   to   be   made   from   the   most   recently   accumulated  earnings   and   profits.  In testing   for   dividend   status,   the   regulations   look   first   to current earnings   and   profits,   determined   as   of the   close   of the   taxable   year   in which   the   distribution   is made.?   A   distribution   out   of current   earnings and   profits   is   thus   a   taxable   dividend   even   if the   corporation   has   a  historical   deficit.   This   seemingly   harsh   rule   was   enacted   many   years   ago  as   a relief measure   to permit   corporations   with   deficits   to pay   dividends  4 ~ Distributions to shareholders in  their other   capacities (e.g., employee, creditor,   lessor) are thus not embraced by Section 301. “Property” is deemed to include money and other  eae assets but not stock in the distributing   corporation or rights to acquire stock. LR.C.  317(a). 5 See also   I.R.C. § 61(a)(7).  ‘3 TR Ct § 243(a), (b)(1), (ec). See Chapter   1D1 supra.   Potential abuses of  the dividends  received deduction are policed by an assortment of Code provisions. See   Section F of  this  chapter, infra.  7 LR.C. § 1(h)(11). See   Section A2 of  this chapter, infra.  8 IL.R.C. § 301(c)(2), (3). The rules   in the text apply to distributions by  C corporations that  do  not file  a consolidated return. Distributions   received by one member of a consolidated   group  from   another member generally are   tax-free, but   the   distributee must   reduce its basis   in  the stock   of  the  payor   by the amount of  the distribution.   See   Reg. § 1.1502—13(f)(2)(ii) and   Chapter 13B,   supra.   Distributions   by   S   corporations   generally are   tax-free to the   extent   of   the  shareholder's   basis, and   any   excess is treated as gain   from a sale   of  the S  corporation   stock  § 1368(b).   See   Chapter   15K, infra. 9   Reg.   § 1.316—-1(a)(1).

CHAPTER 4 NONLIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS 155  and   thus   avoid   an   undistributed   profits   tax   then   in effect.   Although   the  tax   was   later   repealed,   the   “nimble   dividend”   rule   survived   without   any  Congressional   explanation   of why   it was   still   necessary.!°   The   rule   at  least   simplifies   the   inquiry   because   it is rare   for   a company   to   make  distributions   during   a period   when   it is operating   at a loss.   Only   when distributions   exceed   current   earnings   and   profits must   reference   be made to the historical   track   record   of the corporation.  The   dual   focus   in Section   316   on   current   and   accumulated   earnings  and   profits   may   produce   anomalous   results   because   dividend   status   is determined   by   reference   to   the   corporation’s   overall   financial   success rather   than   the   gain   or   loss   realized   by a particular   shareholder.   To   be sure,   most   dividends   represent   an   increase   in the   shareholder’s   wealth rather   than   a   return   of   capital,   but   this   is   not   inevitable   under   the  current   scheme.   For   example,   the existence   of accumulated   earnings   and profits will cause   a distribution   to be classified   as a dividend   even   if those  profits   were   earned   before   the   shareholder   acquired   his stock.  To   illustrate,   assume   that   Shareholder   forms   Corporation   with  initial   paid-in   capital   of   $110.   During   its   first   year   of   operation, Corporation   earns   $20   and   distributes   $30   to   Shareholder.   The distribution   consists   of   a   $20   dividend   (out   of   current   earnings   and profits)   and   a   $10   return   of capital,   and   Shareholder   reduces   his   stock  basis   by   $10   to   $100.   In   year   two,   assume   Corporation   earns   $50   and  makes   no   distributions,   ending   the   year   with   $50   of   accumulated earnings   and   profits.   At   the   beginning   of   year   three,   Buyer   (an  individual)   acquires   all   the   stock   of   Corporation   for   $150,   and  Shareholder   realizes   a $50   long-term   capital   gain.   Assume   further   that  Corporation,   now   wholly   owned   by Buyer,   suffers   a $10 loss in year   three, causing   its accumulated   earnings   and   profits   account   to decrease   to $40.  If Corporation   breaks   even   in   year   four   but   distributes   $30,   Buyer   is  taxed   on   the   entire   distribution   because   it is made   from   accumulated  earnings   and   profits.   But   in   substance   Buyer   has   received   merely   a return   of capital.   After   all, he   paid   $150   for the   stock,   and   the   company has   since lost $10 while   distributing   $30 to Buyer,   who   is understandably surprised   to realize   $30   of ordinary   income   even   though   the value   of his investment   has   declined.   ; In   an academically tidy   world,   the   curious result   illustrated above  should not   occur. Instead,   the   tax treatment of distributions   should  depend on   the   gain or loss realized by the shareholder rather   than the corporation’s   financial   track   record   over   time.   Ideally, Shareholder  _ should   be  taxed at ordinary   income rates to the  extent   that the  gain on a  sale  of  his  stock is attributable to undistributed   corporate   earnings   while  he  was a shareholder. It then  would be unnecessary to tax  those   earnings  10 See   Bittker & Eustice,   Federal   Income   Taxation of Corporations   and   Shareholders  4 8.02[3].

156  Crd   Cr\  TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  again when   they are   distributed   to Buyer,   who   logically   should   be treated as receiving   a return   of capital   rather   than   a $30   dividend. In   the   early   days   of the   income   tax,   taxpayers   in   Buyer’s   position  argued   that   distributions   out   of preacquisition   earnings   should   not   be  taxable   since   they did not represent   any   real gain to the shareholder.   The  Supreme   Court   put   this   argument   to rest,   reasoning:!1  Dividends   are   the   appropriate   fruit   of   stock   ownership,   are  commonly   reckoned   as income,   and   are   expended   as   such   by the  stockholder   without   regard   to whether   they   are   declared   from the   most   recent   earnings,   or   from   a surplus   accumulated   from  the   earnings   of the   past,   or   are   based   upon   the   increased   value of the   property   of the   corporation.   The   stockholder   is, in   the ordinary   case,   a   different   entity   from   the   corporation,   and  Congress   was   at liberty to treat   the   dividends   as   coming   to him  ab   extra,   and   as   constituting   a   part   of his   income   when   they came   to hand. Despite its conceptual flaws, the present approach is defensible on practical grounds. Since shares in publicly   held corporations are traded  daily, it would be difficult   to determine precisely   the corporation’s earnings   during the period that any particular shareholder held his  stock. The current scheme at least ensures that earnings will be taxed to some shareholder, even if that shareholder may not be  the theoretically correct one. Moreover, the presumption that distributions are made out of a corporation’s earnings   and profits to the extent they exist often  eliminates the chore of tracing the   source of a distribution and  considerably simplifies   the system.  2. QUALIFIED   DIVIDENDS  Code: § 1(h)(11). For most of our   tax   history, dividends   have   been   taxed as ordinary income. Relief from   multiple   taxation is provided to corporate  shareholders   by the Section   243   dividends   received   deduction. From time  to time, individual shareholders also have received   very modest relief  from   double taxation, most often in the form of a limited dividend exclusion   that ranged   from   $50 to $400 before it was   repealed in  1986. As   previewed in Chapter 1,12 the double   taxation of corporate earnings   has   been part of an ongoing tug of war over   capital   gains   tax rates   since   the introduction of economic   stimulus legislation   in  the   early 2000s. One   outcome of that   debate   was the   historic   decision to tax  “qualified   dividends”   received   since January 1, 2003   by   noncorporate  shareholders at the  preferential   long-term capital   gains rates. Currently,  this  tax   preference for dividends   results   in a top  rate   of  23.8   percent for  ee eee  11 Lynch v.

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  high-income   taxpayers   (those   above   certain   statutorily   set   levels   of  ordinary   income).   Lower   qualified   dividend   tax   rates   of 18.8   percent,   15  percent,   and   zero   percent   apply to taxpayers   who   are   taxable   on ordinary income   at   rates   below   the   high-income   thresholds.13   Technically,   these preferential   rates   have   been   implemented   by   including   “qualified dividend   income”   within   the   definition   of “net   capital   gain”   in   Section 1(h), which   provides   for the maximum   rate   on   long-term   capital   gains for noncorporate   taxpayers.!*   The   dividend   rate   reduction   applies   for both the   regular   tax   and   the individual   alternative   minimum   tax. To be eligible for the reduced   rates,   a dividend   must   be received   from a domestic   or foreign   corporation   that   meets   certain   criteria.15   But   some income   items   that   are   labelled   “dividends”   do   not   qualify   for   the   rate  reduction.   Familiar   examples   are   credit   union   and   money   market   fund  dividends,   “dividends”   paid on hybrid   corporate   instruments   (e.g., certain types   of   preferred   stock   that   are   treated   as   debt   by   the   issuing  corporation),   and   payments   in lieu   of dividends   on   stock   that   has   loaned  as   part   of   a   short   sale   transaction.16   Corporate   payors   must   identify which   dividends   are   “qualified”   on   the   Form   1099s   that   they   send   at the end   of the   year,   but   shareholders   are   responsible   for determining   if they comply   with   the holding   period   requirements   discussed   below.  To   prevent   arbitrage   opportunities   on   short-term   trades,   the common   stock   with   respect   to   which   the   dividend   was   paid   must   have  been   held   by the   taxpayer   for more   than   60   days   in the   121-day   period beginning   60   days   before   the   stock’s   ex-dividend   date.!7   The   ex-dividend date   is the   first   date   on   which   a share   with   respect   to which   a dividend has   been   declared   is   sold   without   the   buyer   being   entitled   to   the dividend.18   Without   this   rule,   a   taxpayer   could   acquire   stock   shortly before   becoming   entitled   to a dividend,   sell the stock   at a capital loss that could   offset   short-term   capital   gain   or up   to $3,000   of ordinary   income   if the taxpayer   has   no   capital   gains,   but still pay   tax on   the   dividend   at the preferential   rate.   Several   other   rules   have   been   included   to   prevent opportunistic   exploitation   of the rate   reduction.!9  13 See I.R.C. § 1G)(5). Note that some but not all taxpayers whose qualified dividends are  taxed at 15 percent are subject to the   extra 3.8 percent tax   on   net investment income.  144 [.R.C. § 1(h)(1),   (11). Qualified   dividends are subject to the   preferential tax   rates applicable to net capital gains but  they are still ordinary   income.   Thus, qualified dividends may not  be offset by capital   losses without   being subject to the $3,000   limitation in Section   1211(b).  1   T.R.C.   § 1(h)(11)(B)@). 16   .R.C.   § 1(h)(11)(B)@).  17 T.R.C. § 1(h)(11)(B)Gii), which imports,   with   some modifications,   similar   holding   period  limitations   on   the  corporate   dividends   received   deduction   and   requires a longer   holding   period (91 days   during the 181-day   period  beginning 90  days  before   the ex-dividend  date)  for dividends  paid with   respect to preferred stock. See   LR.C. § 246   and   Section   F2 of  this chapter, infra. 18 Under stock exchange rules,  the  ex-dividend   date is typically three   days  before   the date  on which   shareholders   of  record   are  entitled  to  receive   a declared   dividend.  19 See, e.g., LR.C.   §  1(h)(11)(D)@).  157

158   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  3.   ECONOMIC   IMPACT   OF   DIVIDEND   RATE   REDUCTIONS  Factors   Influencing   Corporate   Dividend   Policy.   The   distribution policies   of closely   held   C corporations   are   often   motivated   by the   goal of getting   corporate   profits   to the   shareholders   at the   lowest   tax   cost.   For those   shareholders,   the   issue   is   the   comparative   tax   costs   of:   (1) dividends;   (2) payments   that   are   tax   deductible   by the   corporation   (e.g.,  salary,   interest,   and   rent);   and   (3) transactions   (such   as   redemptions)  where   shareholders   can   bail   out   earnings   at   capital   gains   rates.20 Dividend   policies   of publicly traded   corporations,   on   the other   hand,   vary widely.   Most   “old   economy”   companies   adhere   to the   tradition   of paying  quarterly   dividends,   increasing   them   at   regular   intervals   and   rarely  reducing   their   payouts   unless   the   company   is   in   serious   financial difficulty.   Many   “new   economy”   companies,   such   as   those   in   the  technology   sector,   opt   not   to   pay   dividends,   hoping   instead   to   reward investors   with   increased   share   prices.  What is it that motivates public companies to pay   dividends and to what extent   do the   tax laws   influence corporate   dividend policy? These questions have   stimulated a lively theoretical   debate.21 One view is that companies pay   dividends to serve as a signal to the   financial markets of their profitability and future   expectations,22 enhancing shareholder value through their positive impact on the   price of the stock. Beginning in the 1980s, however,   and   continuing through 2003, dividends became less fashionable. In explaining this decline, some corporate   finance  theorists explained that, apart from taxes and transaction costs,  shareholders benefit more when a corporation   deploys its available cash for business   expansion, acquisition of other companies, or repurchases of  its own stock. Under this theory, shareholders   should be  indifferent to a  corporation’s dividend policy because   they   reap the same benefit when the   stock   price increases to reflect undistributed   earnings   and   they are free to generate “homemade dividends” by strategically timed sales   of  stock.?3 Throughout this debate,   there also has   been much discussion of  the   different   interests of corporate managers and   shareholders,   and the potential “agency costs” when   managers use retained earnings to make suboptimal   investments or simply   hoard cash.24 Encouraging dividends is said to counteract this form of managerial   empire building   and   imposes  a measure of discipline. Returning the money to investors in the form of  20 See Chapters   1C & 3A,  supra;   Section E of this chapter, infra; and Chapter 5, infra.  21 See   generally Hamilton   & Booth, Business Basics for Law Students:   Essential Concepts and Applications § 12.11   (4th ed. 2006);   Klein,   Coffee & Partnoy,   Business  Organization   and   Finance,   Legal   and   Economic Principles   395 et   seq.

CHAPTER 4 NONLIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS 159  dividends,   so   the   argument   goes,   allows   capital   to   be   redirected   more  efficiently   and   promotes   economic   growth.25  Impact   of Taxes   on   Dividend   Payout.   The   dividend   rate   reductions  introduced   in 2003   provided   an   opportunity   for economists   to revisit   the impact   of taxes   on   corporate   dividend   policy.   The   traditional   view   is that the   “double   tax”   on   corporate   profits   lowers   a   shareholder’s   return   on  investment   and   encourages   corporations   to hoard   cash,   locking   in huge stockpiles   of capital   that   could   be   reinvested   more   efficiently   if it were distributed   and   redeployed   by   shareholders.   It follows   from   this   thesis  that   lower   tax   rates   will   lead   to higher   dividends   and   new   investments by the   shareholders   who   receive   them.   Others   contend   that   dividend   tax  cuts   do   not   cause   corporations   to   increase   their   payouts   because   their many   institutional   shareholders,   such   as   pension   funds   and   large charities,   don’t   pay   taxes.   These   contrarians   also   argue   that   since   most  new   investments   are   made   by   corporations   from   retained   earnings,  dividend   tax   rate   reductions   are   not an   effective   investment   stimulus. The   evidence   indicates   that   the   dividend   tax   cuts   did   influence  corporate   behavior   and   contributed   to   at least   a   short-term   increase   in payouts   by   public   companies.   A   dramatic   early   example   was   Microsoft  Corporation’s   decision   to   distribute   $32   billion   as   an   extraordinary dividend   at the   end   of 2004,   use   another   $30 billion   to repurchase   stock over   the next   four years,   and   raise its modest   quarterly   dividend.   There also is evidence   that dividends   were   initiated   at corporations   where   stock was   used   as   executive   compensation   to enable   executives   to benefit   from the   lower   tax   rates   on   qualified   dividends.27   More   generally,   several studies   revealed   that   dividends   rose   sharply   in the   years   following   the rate   reductions.28   The   percentage   of public   companies   paying   dividends began   to   increase   in   2008   for   the   first   time   in more   than   two   decades; many   firms   that   had   been   paying   regular   dividends   raised   their   payouts  significantly   after   the   tax   cut;   and   a   few   companies   such   as   Microsoft  paid special   one-time   dividends.9   A report   issued   by Standard   and   Poors  at the end   of 2004   supports   the view   that   the combination   of tax cuts   and  shareholder   pressure   contributed   to   a   surge   in   dividend   payments.*°  Empirical   research   also   suggests   that   the   dividend   tax   cuts   affected  investor   behavior.   While   dividend   income   became   more   attractive   for all  taxable   investors,   the   available   data   reveals   that   taxpayers   in   the  25 See Moore   & Kerpen, “Show Me the Money!

The   economic   stimulus  effects   of what   became   known   as   “the   Bush   tax   cuts”   continue   to   be  debated,   with   the   usual   suspects   taking   predictable   political   positions. One   side argues   that   lower   rates   promote   economic   growth   by increasing  capital   in   the   corporate   sector   and   take   a   significant   step   toward removing   taxes   from   important   economic   decisions.   The   counterpoint  response.   is that   tax   cuts   are   not   a   principal   contributor   to   economic  activity   and,   if they   do have   any   stimulative   effect,   it is short-lived. The   current   state   of dividend   taxation   has   become   relatively   stable in the   sense   that   the rules   are   no   longer   temporary.   But   policy   decisions  about   capital   gains   rates   and   taxation   of   dividends   are,   in   the   end, political   questions,   so   we   always   face   the   potential   of being   one   election  cycle   away   from   possible   change.   Stay   tuned.  B.   EARNINGS   AND   PROFITS Code:   § 312(a),   (c), (f(1),   (k)(I)-(8);   316(a).Skim   § 312(n).  Regulations: §§  1.312-6(a), (b), (d) (first sentence);   1.312—7(b)(1) (first  sentence).  The   Code makes it clear that distributions are dividends only to the extent   that they come from the corporation’s earnings   and profits, but it  curiously does not take the   extra   step and actually   define earnings   and profits. Section   312   describes the effects of certain transactions on  earnings   and profits, and the accompanying regulations   provide ample elaboration,   but a precise   definition of the term is nowhere to be found in the Code or regulations.32 The function of the earnings   and profits  concept, h r, is clear: it is a measuring device   used to determine the  extent to which a distribution is made from ion’s economic  1 osed to its taxable income or paid-in capital. The meaning of earnings   and profits, which is  a phrase peculiar to the   tax   law, has   evolved over   the   years. It  is roughly   analogous (but   not identical) to the accounting   concept of retained   earnings (sometimes  called “earned surplus”) in that   neither amount includes initial paid-in capital or subsequent contributions to capital. The   primary difference is  that retained   earnings are decreased   by stock   distributions and contingency reserves. If earnings   and profits were   similarly   reduced, a company could   avoid   ever making a taxable   distribution simply   by ensuring that its distributions   were   preceded   by   nontaxable stock  dividends or the establishment of reserves for contingencies. Earnings and profits   also   are   not   identical to taxable   income.

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS   161  profits   account   is intended   to measure   the   economic   performance   of the  corporation.   In contrast,   taxable   income   does   not   provide   a true   financial  picture   because   that   concept   is cluttered   with   a host   of policy   incentives  and relief provisions   that bear little or no relationship   to the corporation’s capacity   to pay   dividends.  Although   earnings   and   profits   can   be   determined   by   making  adjustments   to   either   retained   earnings   or   taxable   income,   the  traditional   approach   is to start   with   a corporation’s   taxable   income   and  make   adjustments   that   fall   into   the   four   broad   categories   discussed below.   In general,   the   same   accounting   method   used   by the   corporation to determine   its taxable   income   is employed   in determining   earnings   and profits.33  1.   Certain   items   excluded   from   taxable   income   must   be added   back.  Items   that   represent   true   financial   gain   but   are   exempt   from   tax,   such  as   municipal   bond   interest,   life   insurance   proceeds   and   federal   tax  refunds   and   otherwise   excludable   discharge   of   indebtedness   income  (unless   coupled   with   a basis   reduction   under   Section   1017)   are   included in   earnings   and   profits.34   Contributions   to   capital   and   gains   that   are realized   but   not   recognized   for   tax   purposes   (e.g.,   like-kind   exchanges, Section   351   transfers,   involuntary   conversions   under   Section   1033)   are not   added   back   in computing   earnings   and   profits.%5  2.   Certain   items   deductible   in determining   taxable   income   must   be  added   back.   Certain   deductions   and   benefits   allowed   in   computing  taxable   income   which   do   not   reflect   a real   decrease   in corporate   wealth  are   not   permitted   or   are   restricted   in determining   earnings   and   profits. For   example,   a deductible   item   that   involves   no   actual   expenditure,   such  as   the   Section   243   dividends   received   deduction,   must   be   added   back   to  taxable   income   in   determining   earnings   and   profits.   Similarly,   the depletion   allowance   must   be   based   on   the   corporation’s   cost   of   a depletable   asset   even   if the   corporation   deducts   percentage   depletion   in computing   taxable   income.*6  3. Certain nondeductible items must be subtracted. Some items not  allowed as deductions in computing taxable income in fact represent actual expenditures that diminish a corporation’s   capacity to pay dividends. These items   reduce   earnings   and profits. For example, federal income taxes paid   during the   year by a cash method corporation will reduce   earnings   and profits,37 as will   losses and   expenses   disallowed  33   Reg.   § 1.312-6(a).  34 Reg. § 1.312-6(b).   In  the  case   of life insurance,   the  Service   has  ruled   that earnings   and profits   are increased   by the proceeds collected less the aggregate premiums paid by the  corporation.   Rey.

A   few   courts,   however,   have   permitted a cash   method   corporation to reduce its earnings   and

162   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  under   provisions   such   as   Sections   265   (expenses   allocable   to tax-exempt income),   267   (losses   between   related   taxpayers)   and   274   (travel   and entertainment   expenses)   and   charitable   contributions   in excess   of the ten  percent   corporate   limitation.   In addition,   net operating   losses   and   capital  losses   in excess   of capital   gains   reduce   earnings   and   profits   in the   year they are   incurred.   In order   to avoid   a double   tax benefit,   they may   not be  carried   back   or forward   in determining   earnings   and   profits.  4.   Certain   timing   adjustments   must   be made.   Finally,   a variety   of  adjustments   are   required   to override   timing   rules   that   allow   corporations  to artificially   defer   income   or accelerate   deductions   in computing   taxable  income.38   For   example,   a   corporation   may   not   use   the   generally  applicable   accelerated   cost   recovery   system   (ACRS)   of   Section   168   in  determining   earnings   and   profits.   Instead,   the   cost   of   depreciable property   must   be recovered   in computing   earnings   and   profits   under   the alternative   depreciation   system,   which   employs   the   straight   line method using   specially   prescribed   and   generally   longer   recovery   periods   than ACRS.%9   This   rule   applies   to   property   that   is expensed   under   Section 168(k).   The   corporation   thus   must   increase   its   taxable   income   by   the  excess   accelerated   depreciation   allowed   for   tax   purposes.49   Under   a  slightly   different   rule   with   a similar   purpose,   if the   corporation   elects   to  expense   the   cost   of eligible   property   under   Section   179,   it must   amortize  that   expense   ratably   over   five   years   in   determining   earnings   and profits.41   Additional   earnings   and _ profits   timing   rules   require   a  corporation   to   capitalize   otherwise   amortizable   construction   period  interest   and   taxes   and   to   amortize   normally   deductible   mineral  exploration   costs   and   intangible   drilling   expenses   over   extended   time  periods.42  On the income side, realized gains that are deferred for taxable  income   purposes   under the installment sale method of Section   453 or by  the completed contract method of accounting must be  currently   included  in earnings   and profits.43 Moreover, for earnings   and profits purposes, gains on the sale  of inventory must be reported under the standard first-  profits in the year to which the   federal   taxes relate even though the   taxes have not   yet been paid. See e.g., Drybrough v. Commissioner, 238   F.2d   735 (6th  Cir.1956).  a See   generally I.R.C. § 312(m). To prevent   abuse of the dividends   received   deduction, the Section   312(n) adjustments do not apply to distributions to any 20 percent or more corporate  shareholders.   LR.C. § 301(e). The effect   of  this rule is  to reduce   earnings   and profits only in determining the amount of any   dividend to major   corporate   shareholders.   See   Section   F5 of this chapter, infra.  89 LR.C.   §§  312(k)(3)(A); 168(g)(2).  ond The adjusted basis   of  the property determined   under this special   provision also is used  in determining the impact of a sale or other   disposition of property on earnings   and profits.  LR.C,   § 312(f)(1). In virtually all cases,   this  rule   will cause   corporations to have different bases in property for purposes of determining   taxable   income   and   earnings   and profits.  “1   LR.C.   § 312(k)(3)(B). #2 6 LR.C.   § 312(m)(1), (2). 48 LR.C.   § 312(m)(5), (6).

It is an   artificial   “account”   created   by the   Code—not   an actual   bank   account   or   liquid   fund   set   aside   by the   corporation   for the  payment   of dividends.   There   is no   statute   of limitations   on   earnings   and profits   issues,   and   a corporation   sometimes   will face   the   onerous   task   of  reconstructing   many   years   of financial   history   in order   to determine   the tax   consequences   of a current   distribution.4®  PROBLEM  X   Corporation   is a   cash   method,   calendar   year   taxpayer.

When   there   are   insufficient   current   earnings   and   profits   available   to +r   cover   all cash   distributions   made   during   the   year,   earnings   and   profits  must be   allocated to the distributions in order to determine dividend  status under the following rules:51 (1) First, current earnings and profits, determined as of the  end of the year, are prorated among the distributions by using the following   formula:52  Current E & P Amount of . Total current E & P a  allocated to distribution ~ distribution   Total   distributions  (2) Next, accumulated earnings   and profits   are allocated chronologically to distributions (i.e., on a first-come, first-  served basis).53  (3)   If the corporation   has a current loss but has accumulated earnings   and profits from prior   years, it will be necessary  to determine the amount of accumulated earnings   and profits available on the   date of distribution.

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS   165  Revenue   Ruling   74-164  1974-1   Cum.   Bull.   74.  Advice   has been   requested   concerning   the taxable   status   of corporate distributions   under   the circumstances   described   below. X   corporation   and   Y   corporation   each   using   the   calendar   year   for Federal   income   tax   purposes   made   distributions   of   $15,000   to   their  respective   shareholders   on   July   1, 1971,   and   made   no   other   distributions  to   their   shareholders   during   the   taxable   year.   The   distributions   were  taxable   as   provided   by   section   301(c)   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   of  1954.  Situation   1  At the beginning   of its taxable   year   1971,   X corporation   had   earnings  and   profits   accumulated   after   February   28,   1913,   of $40,000.   It had   an operating   loss   for the   period   January   1, 1971   through   June   30,   1971,   of  $50,000   but   had   earnings   and   profits   for the   entire   year   1971   of $5,000.  Situation   2  At the beginning   of its taxable   year   1971,   Y corporation   had a deficit  in earnings   and   profits   accumulated   after   February   28,   1913,   of $60,000.  Its net profits for the period January   1, 1971   through   June   30, 1971,   were $75,000   but its earnings   and   profits for the entire   taxable   year   1971   were only   $5,000.  Situation   3  Assume the same facts as in Situation 1 except that X had a deficit in earnings   and profits   of $5,000 for the   entire taxable   year 1971.  Situation   4  Assume the same facts as in Situation 1 except that X had a  deficit in earnings   and profits   of $55,000 for the   entire taxable   year 1971.  Section   301(a) and 301(c) of the Code provides, in part,   that: (1) the  portion of a distribution of property made by a corporation to a shareholder with   respect to its stock which is a dividend (as defined in  section 316),   shall be included in the shareholder's gross income; (2) the  portion of  the  distribution which is not a dividend shall be  applied against and   reduce the adjusted basis   of  the stock; and (3) the portion which is  not a dividend to the  extent   that it exceeds the adjusted basis of  the stock and is not   out   of increase in value   accrued before March 1, 1913, shall be  treated as gain  from the   sale or exchange of property.  - Section   316(a)   of  the Code   provides that   the term   “dividend” means any   distribution of property made   by a corporation to  its shareholders out of its earnings   and profits accumulated after February 28,  1913, or out  of its earnings   and profits   of  the   taxable   year computed as of  the   close   of  the   taxable   year   without   diminution   by  reason   of any   distribution made during   the  year,   and   without   regard to the amount   of earnings   and profits  at the  time   the  distribution   was   made.

166  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Section   1.316—2(a)   of the   Income   Tax   Regulations   provides,   in part,  that   in determining   the   source   of a distribution,   consideration   should   be  given   first, to the earnings   and   profits   of the taxable   year;   and   second,   to  the   earnings   and   profits   accumulated   since   February   28,   1913,   only   in  the case   where,   and   to the   extent   that,   the   distributions   made   during   the  taxable   year   are   not   regarded   as   out   of the   earnings   and   profits   of that  year.  Applying   the   foregoing   principles,   in Situation   1, the   earnings   and  profits   of X   corporation   for   the   taxable   year   1971   of   $5,000   and   the earnings   and   profits   accumulated   since   February   28,   1913,   and   prior   to  the taxable   year   1971,   of $40,000   were   applicable   to the distribution   paid  by it on   July   1, 1971.   Thus,   $5,000   of the distribution   of $15,000   was   paid  from   the earnings   and   profits   of the taxable   year   1971   and   the balance   of $10,000   was   paid   from   the   earnings   and   profits   accumulated   since  February   28,   1913.   Therefore,   the   entire   distribution   of $15,000   was   a  dividend   within   the   meaning   of section   316   of the   Code. In   Situation   2   the   earnings   and   profits   of   Y   corporation   for   the  taxable   year   1971   of $5,000   were   applicable   to the   distribution   paid by Y  corporation   on   July   1, 1971.   Y corporation   had   no   earnings   and   profits  accumulated   after   February   28,   1913,   available   at   the   time   of   the  distribution.   Thus,   only   $5,000   of the   distribution   by   Y corporation   of  $15,000   was   a   dividend   within   the   meaning   of section   316   of the   Code.  The   balance   of   such   distribution,   $10,000   which   was   not   a   dividend,  applied   against   and   reduced   the   adjusted   basis   of the   stock   in the   hands of the shareholders,   and   to the extent   that   it exceeded   the   adjusted   basis of the   stock   was   gain from   the   sale or exchange   of property.  In the  case   of a deficit in earnings   and profits for the taxable   year in  which distributions are made, the taxable status of distributions is  dependent   upon the amount of earnings   and profits accumulated since  February 28, 1913, and available at the   dates of distribution.   In  determining the amount of such   earnings   and profits, section 1.316—2(b)  of the regulations   provides, in effect, that   the deficit in earnings   and  profits of the taxable   year will be prorated to the   dates of distribution.  Applying the foregoing to Situations   3 and 4 the distribution  paid by  X corporation on July 1, 1971, in each   situation was a dividend   within  the meaning of  section 316 of  the Code to the  extent   indicated as follows: Situation   #3  Accumulated   Earnings   and   Profits  (E & P) 1/1   $40,000  E  &  P deficit   for entire   taxable   year  ($5,000)   Prorate to date   of  distribution 7/1 (% of  $5,000)   (2,500)  E  &   P  available   7/1 $37,500

Situations   3 and   4 of Revenue   Ruling   74—  164   do not   consider   the possibility   of earmarking   the entire   1971   deficit   (i.e.,  $5,000   in Situation   3 and   $55,000   in Situation   4) to the first half of the year. Under   the   regulations,»   if those   deficits   were   sustained   in the   first   half of  1971,   the   full   deficit   (not   just   one-half)   would   reduce   the   accumulated  earnings   and   profits   available   to   characterize   the   July   1 distribution   as   a  dividend.   This   would   not   affect the result   in Situation   3 but it would   change  Situation   4, where   there   would   be no   dividend.  Return of   Capital   Distributions and Multiple Tax Lots. The tax treatment of return of capital distributions from C corporations to  shareholders who hold multiple “tax lots” of stock has   never been crystal  clear.   If a distribution is not a dividend,   Section 301(c)(2) first requires a reduction of stock   basis and,   once   basis is reduced to  zero, Section 301(c)(3) treats   the remainder of the   distribution as gain   from the sale   of  the   stock  (usually capital gain). If a shareholder has more   than one   block of stock and the  blocks have different per-share bases,   the question   has been whether the shareholder recovers hisaggregate basis   before recognizing gain, or whether the   distribution must be   allocated   pro   rata to each   share of stock. If an allocation is required,   the  possibility   arises   that a shareholder will recognize  gain on low basis shares   even though the basis   of  the high basis shares   has  not been fully recovered. Regulations that   were   proposed   and later withdrawn   would   have -answered this question   by requiring   the nondividend portion of a  ~ distribution to be  allocated   pro  rata,   on a share-by-share basis, to reduce the  adjusted basis   of each   block   of  stock   held by the shareholder   within   the  class  of  stock upon   which the distribution is made.   The   proposed   regulations   were withdrawn   because   the Treasury   concluded   that   they   could   not   be  implemented   without   significant   modifications.   The   IRS,  however,   indicated  55   Reg.   § 1.316—2(b).  167

Prior   to   the   transactions   below   and   as   a   result   of   a   § 351  transfer,   Ann   has   a $10,000   basis   in her   Pelican   stock.   What   results   to Ann  and   Pelican   in each   of the following   alternative   situations?  (a)   In year   one   Pelican   has   $5,000   of current   and   no   accumulated  earnings   and   profits   and   it distributes   $17,500   to Ann?  (b)   Pelican   has   a $15,000   accumulated   deficit   in its earnings   and  profits   at the   beginning   of year   two.   In year   two   Pelican   has  $10,000   of   current   earnings   and   profits   and   it   distributes  $10,000   to Ann.  (c) Pelican   has $10,000 of accumulated earnings   and profits at the  beginning of year two and $4,000 of current earnings and  profits   in year two. On July 1  of year two, Ann sells half of her Pelican stock to Baker Corporation for $15,000. On April 1 of  year two, Pelican distributes $10,000 to Ann, and on October 1 of year 2, Pelican distributes $5,000 to Ann and $5,000 to  Baker.  (d) Same as (c), above,   except that Pelican   has a $10,000 deficit in  earnings   and profits   in year   2 as a result   of its business operations.  D. DISTRIBUTIONS OF PROPERTY 1, CONSEQUENCES TO THE DISTRIBUTING CORPORATION  a. BACKGROUND: THE GENERAL UTILITIES DOCTRINE  Under the double tax regime of Subchapter C, profits from the sale of appreciated   corporate   property are taxed   twice—first to the corporation when it sells the property   and   again to the shareholders when the   sales proceeds are distributed as dividends. What if   a corporation distributes appreciated   property to   its shareholders?   The  shareholders, of   course,   receive a taxable   dividend to   the   extent   the distribution is out  of current or accumulated   earnings   and profits. Should the  distributing   corporation also recognize gain—just as  if  it had sold  the property for its   fair market value?   Or is the   corporation   entitled to  nonrecognition of gain  because the   property   was   distributed   rather   than  sold? Does   the answer   depend on   the   shareholder’s   basis   in   the  distributed   property? If  tax   relief   is appropriate,   should   nonliquidating 56 REG—143686-07 (Mar.   28,  2019).

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  distributions   be   treated   less   favorably   than   liquidating   distributions? And   what   about   distributions   of loss property?   Simple   as they may   seem,  these   are   among   the   most   controversial   questions   ever   spawned   by  Subchapter   C.   The   answers   will   come   gradually.   The   coverage   in   this chapter   is limited   to   nonliquidating   distributions.   To   set   the   stage,   we begin   with   a brief history   of the   rise   and   fall of what   became   known   as the   General   Utilities   doctrine. In   General   Utilities   &   Operating   Co.   v.   Helvering,5”7   the   Supreme Court   first   considered   the   corporate-level   tax   consequences   of   a nonliquidating   distribution   of appreciated   property   by a   corporation   to its   shareholders.   The   facts   were   straightforward.   General   Utilities Corporation   had   located   a buyer   for corporate   property   with   a value   of  $1,000,000   and   an   adjusted   basis   of $2,000.   Hoping   to escape   the   large  corporate-level   tax   that   would   be   imposed   on a sale   by the   corporation, General   Utilities   distributed   the   property   to   its   shareholders   with   an “understanding”   (but   not   a legal   commitment)   that   they   would   sell the targeted   property   to   the   prospective   buyer.   Four   days   later,   the shareholders   sold the property   to the buyer   on the same   terms   negotiated by   the   corporation.   The   Service   contended   that   the   distribution   was   a taxable   event   at the   corporate   level. By the time the controversy   reached the Supreme Court, the government’s principal argument was   based on the premise that General Utilities had created an indebtedness to its shareholders by declaring a dividend. It went on to contend that using   appreciated   property to discharge that indebtedness   was a taxable event. Apparently confining its decision to these narrow grounds, the Court held  that   the corporation  recognized no gain because the distribution was not a “sale” and the  corporation did   not discharge   indebtedness with appreciated assets.58  Despite this limited   holding, it long was assumed that General Utilities  stood for the broader proposition that a distributing   corporation does not  to its stock. oo  The   result   in General   Utilities   raised   fundamental   policy   questions that went to the heart of  the double tax regime. The decision   created a  significant and   arguably unwarranted tax   distinction between a  57   296   U.S.   200,   56 S.Ct.   185   (1935).  58 The government also argued that the subsequent sale by the shareholders of  the  assets  could   be  attributed to the  corporation,   but   the Court   declined to consider   that question since it ‘had not been raised   below. Ten years later,  in Commissioner v. Court   Holding Co., 324  U.S.   331,  65 S.Ct. 707 (1945),   the government successfully advanced the   attribution argument in   the  context of a liquidating.   distribution.   See Chapter 7B2, infra. In General Utilities, the  government alternatively contended that a distribution of appreciated   property   by a corporation  in and of itself constitutes a realization   event,   but   the Court did not address this argument.   See  Bittker & Eustice,   supra   note   10, § 8.20[2].  59 See, e.g., Commissioner v. Godley’s   Estate,   213   F.2d   529,  531   (3d Cir.1954), cert. denied  348   U.S.   862,   75   S.Ct.   86   (1954). Even   before   the   1954   Code,   however,   the   General Utilities  nonrecognition   rule   was   subject   to  judicially-created   exceptions,   such as   the   assignment of  income   doctrine.   See   S.Rep.   No.   1622,   83rd   Cong.,   2d  Sess.   247   (1954).  169

170   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  distribution   in   kind   of appreciated   property   and   a   sale   of that   same property   by the   corporation   followed   by a distribution   of the   proceeds   to  the   shareholders.   In   the   case   of   a   sale   at   the   corporate   level,   the corporation   recognizes   gain   and   correspondingly   must   increase   its  earnings   and   profits.   On   distribution   of   the   sale   proceeds,   the  shareholders   also   are   taxed   to   the   extent   of the   corporation’s   earnings  and   profits.   Under   General   Utilities,   however,   the   corporation   could  distribute   the   same   asset   to the   shareholders   without   recognizing   gain. Although   the   shareholders   were   taxable   on   the   distribution,   the   asset  appreciation   escaped   tax   at   the   corporate   level,   and   a   noncorporate  shareholder   took   the   asset   with   a fair market   value   basis.6°   This   simple  comparison   demonstrates   that   the tax   treatment   of distributions   in kind  is critical   to the   integrity   of the   double   tax   regime.   Because   the   General  Utilities   doctrine   was   incompatible   with   the   double   tax,   it was   criticized by commentators. ®1  Despite these deficiencies, Congress codified General Utilities in the  1954 Code   by enacting Section 311(a)(2), which provides that a  corporation   generally does not recognize   gain or loss on a nonliquidating distribution of property.62   This nonrecognition rule was never absolute.  Over ‘the years, the   courts applied “common law” doctrines, such as assignment of income® and the   tax   benefit rule,64 and   substance over  form,® to override   Section   311(a) and attribute income back to the corporation. Congress also chipped away at the doctrine with   various  specialized statutory   exceptions until 1986, when it repealed   General Utilities in the context of both nonliquidating and_ liquidating distributions of appreciated property.66  b.   CORPORATE   GAIN   OR   LOSS  Code:   § 311. Although the nonrecognition rule in Section   311(a)(2) remains in the  Code,   Section   311(b) stands   that rule   on its head for nonliquidating distributions of appreciated property.

The   objective   of this  statutory   regime   is to   strengthen   the   corporate   income   tax   by ensuring  that   appreciated   property   may   not   leave   corporate   solution   and   take   a stepped-up   basis   in the hands   of the distributee   shareholder   without   the imposition   of a corporate-level   tax   on   the   appreciation.§8 The   General   Utilities   doctrine   thus   no   longer   applies   to  nonliquidating   distributions   of appreciated property-Atater-chapter  examines   the repeal of the doctrine   in the area   of complete   liquidations.® Despite   what   appears   to be parallel   treatment,   some   differences   between the   treatment   of liquidating   and   nonliquidating   distributions   persist,  raising   lingering   policy   issues.   For   example,   a   distributing   corporation  generally   may   recognize   a loss   on a liquidating   distribution   of property with   a   built-in   loss.7°   Should   nonliquidating   distributions   be   treated  similarly?   Is the   “general”   loss   disallowance   rule   in Section   311(a)(2)   an indefensible   trap for the uninformed?   In considering   these   questions,   one  should   keep   in   mind   that   the   double   tax   regime   is   not   universally accepted,   and   some   commentators   once   argued   that   relief   through limited   General   Utilities   type   exceptions   would   be appropriate.”!  c. EFFECT ON   THE DISTRIBUTING   CORPORATION’S   EARNINGS AND PROFITS  Code:   § 312(a)(3),   (b), ), OQ).  Regulations:   § 1.312-3. Nonliquidating distributions of property   have several effects upon the earnings   and profits   of  the distributing   corporation. Gain   recognized  by the corporation on   the   distribution naturally   increases   current earnings   and profits.72 Following a property distribution,   the distributing  corporation may reduce accumulated earnings   and profits (to the   extent  thereof) under Section   312(a)(3) by the adjusted basis   of  the distributed  LR.C. § 311(b)(2), incorporating the  rule for liquidating   distributions in  I.R.C. § 336(b). Cf. S.Rep.No.   98-169,   98th   Cong.,   2d Sess. 177 (1984); H.R.Rep.No. 99-426,   99th Cong., 1st Sess. 282 (1985). 69   See   Chapter   7B2,   infra.  70   T.R.C.   § 336(a),   (d).  71 Compare   Thompson, “An   Analysis of  the Proposal to Repeal   General Utilities with an  Escape   Hatch,” 31 Tax   Notes   1121   (June 16, 1986)   with   Yin, “General Utilities Repeal: Is Tax  Reform Really   Going to Pass it By?” 31 Tax   Notes   1111   (June 16, 1986).  72 LR.C. § 312(b)(1), (f)(1). For this purpose   and for purposes of determining   gain recognized,   the   adjusted basis   of any   property is  its adjusted   basis   for purposes of computing earnings   and profits.   I.R.C. § 312(b),   flush  language.   For  example,   tangible   property depreciated for  tax   purposes   under   the   accelerated cost recovery   system   must   be   depreciated for “E  oc purposes   under   the § 168(g)(2)   alternative   depreciation   system   and   thus   may   have a  different “EB &  P”  adjusted   basis.  171

172   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  property.   On   a   distribution   of   appreciated   property   (other   than   a  corporation’s   own   debt   obligations),   this   rule   is   modified   by   Section  312(b)(2),   which   provides   that   the   earnings   and   profits   reduction   rule   in  Section   312(a)(3)   is applied   by substituting   the   fair   market   value   of the property   for   its   adjusted   basis.   This   special   rule   logically   allows   a corporation   distributing   appreciated   property   to   make   a   downward adjustment   to accumulated   earnings   and   profits   in an   amount   equal   to the full fair market   value   of the property.   The   net result of these   earnings  and   profits   adjustments—the   first relating   to the   gain recognized   on   the  distribution   and   the   second   relating   to   the   effect   of   the   distribution itself—is   the same   as if the corporation   had   sold the property   (increasing current   earnings   and profits by the gain recognized)   and   then   distributed cash   equal   to   the   fair   market   value   of   the   property   (decreasing  accumulated   earnings   and   profits   by that   amount).  Section   312(c)   cryptically   adds   that   “proper   adjustment”   shall   be made   for   liabilities   either   assumed   by the   shareholder   or   to   which   the  property   is subject.   Section   1.312—3   of the   regulations   provides   that   the “proper   adjustment”   is   a   reduction   in   the   Section   312(a)(3)   charge   to  earnings   and   profits   for   liabilities   assumed   or   to which   the   property   is  subject.   This   adjustment   thus   decreases   the   charge   to   earnings   and profits   and   properly   reflects   the   fact   that   relief   from   the   liability   is an  economic   benefit   to the   distributing   corporation.  d. DISTRIBUTIONS OF  A CORPORATION’S OWN OBLIGATIONS  Code:   §§ 311(a), (b)(1); 312(a)(2).  Regulations: § 1.301—1(d)(1)(i).  By virtue of the parenthetical in Section 311(b)(1)(A),   “(other than  an obligation of such corporation)”,   the general   gain  recognition rule does not apply to distributions by a corporation of its own debt   obligations.  Consequently, the eroded Section   311(a) continues to govern this  situation. At the shareholder level, both the amount of the   distribution  and the  distributee shareholder’s basis are equal to the fair market value of the  obligation.73 The distributing   corporation’s earnings   and profits  are  reduced   by the   principal amount of the   obligation or, in the   case   of  an  obligation having original   issue   discount, by its issue price.74  2. CONSEQUENCES TO THE SHAREHOLDERS  Code: § 301(a)—(d).  The rules governing the shareholder level   tax consequences of property   distributions are essentially   the same as those for cash distributions. The   amount of  the   distribution is the fair market   value of  the   distributed   property,   reduced   by   any liabilities assumed   by the  73 Reg. §§  1.301-1(a)(1)(ii),  —1(h)(2)(4). 7   LR.C.  § 312(a)(2).

The   shareholder’s basis   in the   distributed   property   is its fair market   value   as   of the   date   of the   distribution.76  PROBLEM  Zane,   an   individual,   owns   all   of   the   outstanding   common   stock   in  Sturdley   Utilities   Corporation.   Zane   purchased   his   Sturdley   stock   seven years   ago   and   his   basis   is   $8,000.   At   the   beginning   of the   current   year, Sturdley   had   $25,000   of accumulated   earnings   and   profits   and   no   current  earnings   and   profits.   Determine   the   tax   consequences   to Zane   and   Sturdley in each   of the following   alternative   situations:  (a)   Sturdley   distributes   inventory   ($20,000   fair   market   value;  $11,000   basis)   to Zane.  (b)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that,   before   the   distribution,  Sturdley   has   no   current   or accumulated   earnings   and   profits.  (c)   Sturdley   distributes   land   ($20,000   fair market   value;   $11,000 basis)   which   it has   used   in its business.   Zane   takes   the   land  subject   to a $16,000   mortgage.  (d) Assume Sturdley has $15,000 of current earnings   and profits  (in addition to $25,000 of accumulated earnings   and profits)  and it distributes to Zane land   ($20,000 fair market value; $30,000 basis) which it held as an investment. Compare the result if Sturdley first sold the land and then distributed the  proceeds.  (e) Assume again that Siurdley   has $25,000 of accumulated  earnings   and profits at the beginning of   the current year. Sturdley distributes machinery used in its business   ($10,000 fair market value, zero_adjusted basis for taxable income purposes, and   $2,000 adjusted basis for earnings   and profits + p.  purposes). The machinery is five-year property   and has a  seven-year class life, was purchased   by Sturdley for $14,000 on July 1   of year one when it was fully expensed   under  § 168(k), and the   distribution is made on January 1  of year seven. See IR.C.   §§ 168(g)(2),   312(k)(3); Reg. § 1.3812-15(d).  E. CONSTRUCTIVE   DISTRIBUTIONS  Code: Skim   § 7872(a), (c)(1)(C).  _ Regulations: § 1.301-1(). Historically,   dividend   distributions   often combined the   worst of all possible   worlds   from a tax   standpoint:   they   were fully taxable to  noncorporate   shareholders at the  highest ordinary  income rates but  were  @ LR.C.   § 301(b). The fair market   value   of  the   distributed   property is determined as   of the   date   of distribution.   I.R.C. § 301(b)(8).  76 6J.R.C. §  301(d).  173

174   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  not   deductible   by the   distributing   corporation.   To   avoid   the   double tax, closely   held   C   corporations   have   attempted   to   distribute   earnings   in   a form   that   may   be   deductible   at   the   corporate   level.   Notable   examples  include   a   corporation’s   payment   of:   (1)   excessive   compensation   to  shareholders   or   their   relatives;77   (2)   expenses   paid   for   the   personal  benefit   of shareholders (e.g., travel or   entertainment,   legal   expenses);78  (3)   excessive   rent   for   corporate   use   of shareholder   property;79   and   (4)  interest on shareholder   debt   that   in   substance   represents   equity.89   If  these payments are not what   they   purport   to be—i.e.,   if they   are   not  really   salary,   rent   or   interest,   etc.,   or   if they   are   primarily   for   the  personal   benefit   of shareholders—they   risk   being   reclassified   by the Service as a constructive   dividend.   In   that   event,   the   corporate   level  deduction   will be disallowed.   Other   disguised   dividend   strategies   include labeling   what   in reality   is a distribution   as   a loan to the   shareholder,1  bargain   sales   or   rentals   of corporate   property   to_shareholders®? and  interest   free loans.83   Are   a  The   constructive   dividend   area   has   produced   many   entertaining controversies   involving   blatant   attempts   by   taxpayers   to   milk   their corporations   while   avoiding   the   double   tax.   The   prototype   transaction involves   a   direct   payment   or   receipt   of   an   economic   benefit   by   the  shareholder,   and   resolution   of the issue   requires   an   evaluation   of all the  facts   and   circumstances,   applying   broad   standards   such   as   “reasonable  compensation;”   “shareholder   benefit   vs.   corporate   benefit”   and   “intent.”84 The   case   below   illustrates   a typical   fact pattern.   It is followed   by a Note  discussing   the changing   stakes   now   that   the corporate   tax   rate   has   been reduced   to 21 percent   and   most   dividends   are   taxed   ata   preferential   rate.

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  corporation.   Nicholls   nonvoting   common   stock   was   owned   by   Herbert,  Charlotte   and   their   two   sons,   Robert   _and   James.   James   was   also   an  employee   of Nicholls.  Herbert   Resenhoeft   previously   had   personally   owned   two   boats:   Pea  Picker   I and   Pea Picker II. In 1964,   Nicholls   acquired   a   new   52-foot  yacht—Pea   Picker   IlI—at   a   total   cost   of   $68,290.   Nicholls’   Board   of  Directors   unanimously   approved   the   purchase of Pea   Picker   III   and  provided   in   a   corporate   resolution   that   “any   expenses   incurred   in   the personal   use   of the   boat   are   to   be   borne   by   H.A.   Resenhoeft   and   an accurate   log is to be kept of all business   use.” During   1964,   $1,144.72   was  charged   to Herbert for personal   use   of Pea Picker   III.  Both   Robert   and   James   were   free   to operate   Pea   Picker   III, without  special   permission.   Herbert   was   unable   to   operate   the   yacht   and   had  little   technical   knowledge   about   yachting.   James   was   the   principal operator   of Pea   Picker   II and was   the family boating   enthusiast.   In fact, James   negotiated   Nicholls’   purchase   of the   yacht.   During   1964,   the   use of Pea   Picker   III included   personal   use   by James. In   its original   notice   of deficiency   to   Herbert,   the   Service   took   the  position   that   he   was taxable   on   $68,878.72,   the   purchase   price   for the  yacht   plus   yacht   expenses   for the   year.   Later,   the   Service   alternatively  argued   that   Herbert   was   taxable   on   a dividend   equal to the fair rental _ value   of Pea   Pick   _Kd.] The issues with regard to individual petitioner Resenhoeft resolve  themselves down to the following: (a) Was there a constructive   dividend; (b) may the  use of the yacht by James, a stockholder in  his own right, be  ea iasiandacontrcl of the corporation to make the  father the recipient of the constructive dividend; and (c)  is the measure  of tie-aiviiend The purchase price.of the craft plus   actual operating  expenses or   is the fair rental value of the  use of the yacht   during the  period in question the appropriate measure?  (a)   It   is well established that any expenditure made by a corporation for the personal benefit of its stockholders, or  the making  available of corporate-owned facilities to stockholders for their  personal  benefit, may result   in the   receipt by the stockholders of a constructive dividend. * *  * Upon consideration of all the   evidence,   including the  possible   instances of unrecorded   personal use, we   conclude that Pea  Picker III was   used for business   purposes 25 percent   and for personal  purposes 75 percent of  the  time in  1964. (b) Since   we   have   found that   there   was   personal use constituting  under   some   circumstances a dividend,   the   next   question is,  to whom was the   benefit   directed?   Resenhoeft   has   established   by  convincing   evidence  that   he  was not   interested   in  the   yacht for  his own   personal   pleasure as  a boating   enthusiast.   He   had little knowledge of  the   workings of  such craft,   could   not   operate   them   himself,   and   played   no   direct   part   in  the purchase   of  Pea  Picker   III  or  the  sale of  her predecessor.   However, to  the  175

176   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  extent   that   he was   present   on   an   occasion   of personal   use,   he received   a  benefit   and an   argument   that others benefited   as well is   of no avail here.  ***   He   shared   in   the   friendships   and   joined   in   the   social   activity   on  board   on   those   occasions.  The   question   remains,   however,   whether   James’   personal   use   of Pea  Picker   III   on   occasions   when   Resenhoeft   was   not   present   may nevertheless   be   attributed   to   Resenhoeft.   The   essential   elements underlying   the taxation   of assigned   income   to the assignor   were   set down  in Helvering   v. Horst,   311   U.S.   112   (1940).   The   Court   stated   in that   case  that:   “The   power   to dispose   of income   is the   equivalent   of ‘ownership’   of it and   the   exercise   of that   power   to   procure   the   payment   of income   to another   is the   ‘enjoyment’   and   hence   the   ‘realization’   of the   income   by him   who   exercises   it.” In this case   Resenhoeft   personally   owned   well over  50   percent   of all voting   stock   and   together   with   his   wife   owned   all of it,  and   in addition   was   the   president   of the   company   and   on   the   board   of  directors.   It is manifestly   clear   that   it was   Resenhoeft’s   decision   that   the  corporation acquire Pea Picker  IIT. Resenhoeft’s decision to allow the use  of AAI sk and   without direct control   over either   the circumstances of use or the maintenance of appropriate supportive documentation must be given   particular emphasis.   There is  no indication   here that information   regarding the   actual use of the boat, or the type of records maintained,   was   being kept  from Resenhoeft or that he had no way of learning the truth. * * *  The principle of assignment was applied to constructive dividends in  Byers v. Commissioner, 199   F.2d   273 (C.A.8,   1952),   certiorari denied   345  U.S. 907 (1953). See also Commissioner v. Makransky, 321   F.2d   598  (C.A.3,   1963). We remain unpersuaded that Resenhoeft’s purpose in agreeing to the acquisition of a large pleasure craft was only to benefit the corporation.   This is particularly so in   light   of his prior personal  ownership of Pea Picker I  and II which were available for the   use and  benefit of his  sons. Once it is understood that   Resenhoeft was in complete  control of the events,   the fact that James, the   principle   user of the   boat  for noncorporate purposes,   was a mature adult and a shareholder in his  own right becomes irrelevant.  (c) Although we   have determined that   there was a dividend, and that   the dividend must be   attributed to Resenhoeft,   we   have yet to  ascertain   the amount of the   dividend. Two standards   have   been   used on  different   occasions,   the first being the   initial cost of the facility and the  second,   the approximate rental   value for the period at   issue. The standard to be  chosen rests   on   the facts and   circumstances of  the   event rather   than on which year   (the initial year of purchase or a subsequent year) happens to be  before   the  Court, as was   argued   by respondent in his  briefs. In   Louis   Greenspon,   supra,   the   Court   held   that continued corporate   ownership of farm   equipment   used   by the   petitioner shareholder   prevented   the   assessment of  a constructive   dividend   based on   the   purchase   price   of  the   equipment.   No   determination   of  a dividend

CHAPTER 4 NONLIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS  was   made   based   on   the rental   value   since   respondent   failed   to raise   that issue.   Our   holding   in Greenspon   that ownership   of the asset   is a principal  factor   has   not   been   altered   by   subsequent   cases   involving   the   year   an asset   was   acquired.   Although   in some   cases   subsequent   to Greenspon   we have   determined   the amount   of the dividend   to be the acquisition   cost, in  those   cases   the   evidence   clearly   pointed   to shareholder   ownership,   * * * or   the   location   of   title   could   not   be   determined   and   therefore   was presumptively   in   the   shareholder.   * * *   These   cases   have   not   been  followed   when   the title was   clearly   with   the   corporation.   * * *  In   this   case,   ownership   continued   to rest   with   Nicholls.   The   bill of sale   was   made   in   Nicholls’   name,   Nicholls’   principal   creditor   was  in ormed of   the purchase   and the yacht’s   intended   devotion   to corporate  purposes,   a   license   to operate   short-wave   radio   equipment   installed   on Pea   Picker   III was   acquired   in the   corporate   name,   registration   by U.S. Customs   was   attempted   in   the   corporate   name,   registration   and  licensing was   received   from   the State   of Wisconsin   in the corporate   name,  and   sales   tax   was   paid by the   corporation   although a significant   savings would   have   resulted   by   treating   this   as   a   purchase   by   Resenhoeft. Although a listing   in the   Lake   Michigan   Yachting   Association   catalogue showed   James   as the owner   of the Pea Picker III, the association   provided no   means   for noting   corporate   ownership,   and   registration   in whatever  name   offered   values   significant   to the   corporation   as   well   as   to James.  Therefore   we   hold   that   petitioner   has   not   received   a   constructive  dividend   equivalent   to the cost   of acquisition   of Pea   Picker   III.  The   issue   yet   remaining   is   whether   there   is   another   more appropriate   measure   of the   constructive   dividend,   a   dividend   which   we have   already   decided   Resenhoeft   received.  Respondent’s   alternative   theory   is that   the   fair rental   value   of Pea  Picker   III for   the   period   of use   in   1964   is the   measure of the dividend  received;   furthermore,   respondent   argues   that   the   testimony   of   the captain   in charge   of delivering   Pea   Picker   III from   Florida   corroborates  the   minimum   rental   value   alleged   in respondent’s   amended   answer.   The amended   answer   alleged   that   the   fair value   was   not   less   than   Nicholls’  combined   depreciation   and   operating   expenses,   $4,578.86,   of   which  $1,144.72   concededly   was   included   as   income   by Resenhoeft   at the   time he   filed   his   1964   return.   Since   we   have   already   determined   that  Resenhoeft   should   be   charged   with   75   percent   of the   total   value   of the  use   of the   yacht   rather   than   100   percent   as   argued   by respondent,   the remaining   amount   actually   in dispute   is $2,289.42.   * * * Ordinarily,   respondent’s   alternative   allegation would be determinative since   petitioner   has   offered   no evidence   showing that determination to be   in   error. However, since   the   theory of a dividend  based on   rental   value   comprises a separate issue, involving   distinct  factual   questions,   and   was   raised   by the Commissioner for  the first time  in his amended   answer,   the rental   value   suggested   by  the   Commissioner  may   not be given   the  presumption it would   otherwise   be due * * * . Upon  177

178   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2 considering   all evidence,   including   the rental   value   of similar   craft used  in dissimilar   water,   we   hold   that   the   full rental   value   of Pea   Picker TIT  for the period   following   the   shakedown   cruise   and   ending   with   the   fina  storage   of the   boat   was   $4,000.   Resenhoeft   gained   personal   benefit   and  therefore   received   a constructive   dividend   from   his own   use   and   the   use of the craft by his sons   equaling   75 percent   of the   above   rental   value;   of  that   amount   he   has   voluntarily   recognized   income   to   the   extent   of $1,144.72.   We   have   no   reason   to believe   Nicholls’   earnings   and   profits were   insufficient   for   the   payment   of a   taxable   dividend   of the   amount  determined   above.  K*K*K  NOTE  Payment   of deductible   expenses   by a C corporation   to its shareholders  has   been   one   of   the   classic_strategies   to   escape   the   double   taxation   of  corporate   income.   The   effectiveness   of   that   strategy,   however,   was diminished   by   the   reduction   in   the   top   corporate   tax   rate   from   35   to   21  percent   in the   Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs   Act.   A payment   that   is deductible   by the  corporation   now   saves   only a 21 percent   tax on   the amount   of income   leaving  the   corporate   coffers.   This   change   upends,   or   at   least   significantly neutralizes,   many   of the time-tested   tax   saving   plans   that   were   historically  employed   by closely held   corporations. To understand the effect of the reduced corporate tax   rate   on these  venerable strategies, assume a C corporation   has $100,000 of taxable income  that its sole shareholder   wishes to withdraw from the business at the lowest possible tax cost. If a dividend is contemplated, the corporation will first pay a 21 percent   corporate tax ($21,000), leaving $79,000 for distribution as   a  dividend. The   shareholder will be   taxed on the $79,000   dividend at either a  15   percent, 18.8 percent, or 23.8 percent rate.85 The 18.8 percent qualified  dividend rate begins to apply to individuals at $200,000 of modified   adjusted  gross income ($250,000 in the   case   of married   taxpayers filing jointly).86 In 2019, the   23.8 percent   dividend rate begins to apply at $434,550 of taxable income for an individual taxpayer   ($488,850 in the   case   of a married taxpayer filing jointly).87 After combining the   21 percent   corporate rate and  the applicable shareholder   dividend rate, the total tax   rate   on   the $100,000  of income will be  either   32.85   percent,   35.85   percent or 39.8   percent.88  _ * The discussion   disregards the   possibility   of a zero   tax for dividends for certain lower  income   taxpayers,   takes into account the 3.8 percent tax   on   net investment   income,   and ignores state   taxes. See I.R.C. §§ 1G)(5)(A)(i),   (B)@); 1411.  i LR.C.  § 1411(a)(1),  (b) & (c). For  purposes of the 3.8 percent net investment   income tax,  modified   adjusted   gross   Income   means adjusted gross income   increased by certain items related to the  exclusion in Section   911 for foreign earned   income. I.R.C, § 1411(d). 87 1.R.C. § 1())(5)(A)(ii),   (B)Gi);   see Rev.   Proc. 2018-57,   § 3.03, 2018-49 L.R.B.   827.  In   each case,   the   corporate   tax is $21,000.   At   the   various   dividend tax   rates,   the  respective   shareholder-level   taxes   on   the   $79,000   dividend are: $1  1,850 (15% x $79,000),  $14,852   (18.8% x $79,000), or $18,802   (23.8% x $79,000).   The   combined   taxes   are   thus   $32,850  ($21,000   +  $11,850),   $35,852   ($21,000   +  $14,852), or $39,802   ($21,000   +  $18,802).  88

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  The   next   question   for the   shareholder   is whether   it is possible   to reduce  the total   tax   cost   in this   simple   example   by, instead,   having   the corporation  make   a   $100,000   tax-deductible   payment   to the   shareholder   in some   other  capacity   (e.g.,   lender   or   lessor)   of, say,   interest   or   rent?   Since   the   corporate  tax 1s eliminated   by the deductible   payment,   the answer   depends   on the total  tax owed   by the   shareholder   on   the $100,000   of income.   Determination   of the  shareholder’s   tax   results   raises   additional   issues   depending   on   the   form   of the   payment.   In   2019,   single   individuals   begin   paying   tax   at   a   32   percent  rate   on   taxable   income   above   $160,725,   and   married   taxpayers   filing jointly  reach   the   32   percent   marginal   tax   rate   on   taxable   income   above   $321,450. The   35   percent   marginal   tax   rate   begins   to apply   to taxable   income   greater  than   $204,100   (for single taxpayers)   and   $408,200   (for married   filing jointly). And   a 37 percent   marginal   tax rate   is possible   for taxpayers   with   even   higher levels of taxable   income.   Note   that the tax rates   on ordinary   income   generally  do   not   correlate   to   the   income   levels   for   increases   in   the   tax   rates   for  dividends.®9   In addition,   the 3.8 percent   tax on net investment   income   begins to apply   above   a $200,000   modified   adjusted   gross   income   threshold   amount for   singles   and   a   $250,000   threshold   amount   for   married   taxpayers   filing jointly.   Another   potential   complication   is whether   the   payment   received   by the   shareholder   may   potentially   be   eligible   for the   Section   199A   deduction for qualified   business   income,   thereby   possibly   saving   20   percent   of the   tax owed   on   the   payment. If you get the  sense that  there are a lot of “moving parts” to this analysis, join  the crowd. Are there any   generalizations that   can   be made?   Perhaps a  few. First, at high income levels, if the taxpayer   owes the additional 3.8  percent tax  on  net investment   income (for example, on a payment of  interest), the total shareholder tax   rate   likely will be 35.8 percent (32 percent plus 3.8 percent) or higher (up to 40.8 percent (37 percent plus 3.8 percent)), and it will be difficult,   if not impossible, to significantly improve on the  overall   tax  results by having the corporation make a tax-deductible payment rather that distributing   dividends. The availability of  the Section 199A deduction for the  shareholders with respect to the corporate payment (e.g., on   the   receipt of  rent), might offer some   hope for tax savings by cutting the shareholder’s tax  rates by 20   percent,   but to achieve that   result   the Section 199A limitations  on high-income   taxpayers   must be successfully   navigated.  e  Additional tax considerations   come into play if   a closely-held  corporation decides to pursue the “corporate   deduction”   strategy to avoid  double   taxation by  paying   compensation to a shareholder-employee. Wages are taxable at the highest   ordinary   income tax   rates and are   also subject to  employment taxes equal to 12.4 percent of  the social security wage base   and  a  2.9 percent Medicare tax   on all wages.   These taxes are paid   one-half   each  _ by the employer   and   employee. Wages above   $200,000   earned   by a single taxpayer are   also   subject to  a  .9 percent   additional Medicare tax payable   by the employee.   Compensation   and the  employer’s   share of employment taxes are deductible   by the   employer.   Similar   rules   apply to self-employed  taxpayers,   except   they   bear   the full burden of   the   additional tax. And  89 The   20   percent   dividend   rate   does   correlate to income levels   for   the   pre-2018   39.6  percent   rate   on   ordinary   income.   See   L.R.C. §  1G)(5)(A)@),   (B)@i).  179

z—~  €>   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   .   PART   2  remember   that   the   shareholder’s   tax   rate   on   qualified   dividends   can   be   15,  18.8   or   23.8   percent.  The   point   of all the   detail   about   employment   taxes   is that   the   payment   ~ of compensation   to avoid   double   taxation   of corporate   profits   introduces   even more   “moving   parts”   into   the   calculations.   Key   considerations   are   the amount   of additional   employment   tax   incurred   as   a   result   of paying   the  compensation   and   the   combined   tax   rates   for   the   corporation   and   the  shareholder.   A   few   generalizations   can   be   offered.   If the   amount   of   the  shareholder-employee’s   compensation   is   already   above   the   social   security wage   base   ($132,900   in 2019),   then   payments   of extra   compensation   will not  be subject to the   12.4   percent   tax and   the payment   of compensation   may   save  some   overall   tax compared   to paying   dividends.   In contrast,   if the employee’s  compensation   is subject   to the   12.4   percent   tax,   then   the   total   costs   to the  corporation   and   employee   of paying   compensation   (including   employment taxes)   become   significantly   greater.   Taxpayers   subject   to   the   12.4   percent employment   tax   would   normally   pay   income   tax   on   compensation   at   10,   12,  22, or   24   percent   rates   and   dividends   received   by those   taxpayers   would   be taxed   at   a   zero   or   15   percent   rate.   The   combination   of these   individual income   tax   rates,   the   12.4   percent   employment   tax,   and   the   21   percent corporate   tax   make   it difficult   to   generate   overall   tax   savings   by   paying  compensation   compared   to   paying   corporate   dividends,   and   it   may   be  preferable   to pay   dividends.®   In some   situations,   however,   the scales   may   be tipped   in   favor   of compensation,   such   as   where   a   shareholder-employee  receives   tax-free   fringe   benefits,   Social   Security   service   credit,   or   tax- deferred   employer   contributions   to a qualified   retirement   plan.  In conclusion, the   strategies   that   historically have led to constructive  dividend   controversies are   far   less robust in a world   with a 21 percent  corporate tax  rate and preferentially taxed   dividends. Shareholders of closely held corporations and their advisors will likely file away the “old learning” for the future in the event either corporate tax   rates are increased or  dividends are once again   taxed as ordinary   income.  F. ANTI-AVOIDANCE   LIMITATIONS ON   THE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED   DEDUCTION  1.   IN GENERAL  Code:   §§ 243(a)(1), (3), (c); 246(a)(1), (b)(1), (c); 246A; 1059(a)—(e)(1). Skim  §§ 243(b)(1);   1059(e)(2), (3), (f).  Dividends received by   corporate   shareholders ‘are treated more  generously for tax purposes   than   dividends   received by individuals. If  corporate   shareholders   were   taxed in full on   the dividends   they receive,  corporate profits would be   subjected to   a minimum of three   levels   of  90 The   comparison basically is between (1) saving the  corporate   tax at 21   percent,   versus  (2) the combination of  the   12.4 percent employment tax   plus   the income tax   paid at ordinary  income rates   on   the compensation.   At  the  lowest   ordinary   income tax   rates   (10 and 12  percent) the   results   begin to look   promising,   but   those   are   also   the   income   ranges   when   dividends   bear  no   tax.

}  CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  taxation—once   when   earned,   a   second   time   when   received   as   dividends  by the corporate   shareholder,   and   again   when   distributed   to the ultimate  noncorporate   shareholder.   To   alleviate   this   multiple   taxation,   Section  243   generally   permits   corporate   shareholders   to   deduct   50   percent   of  dividends   received   from   other   corporations.   The   deduction   is increased   to  65 percent   if the   corporate   shareholder   owns   20 percent   or   more   (by vote  and   value)   of the distributing   corporation’!   and   to 100 percent   for certain  “qualifying”   dividends   if   the   payor   and   recipient   corporations   are members   of the   same   affiliated   group.9?   As   a result,   a maximum   of only 50 percent   of dividends   received   by corporate   shareholders   are   subject   to tax,   for   a maximum   effective   rate   of 10.5   percent.93   The   availability   of this   deduction   has   inspired   tax   advisors   to   devise   techniques   to   take  advantage   of the   lower   effective   rate   on   dividends   received   by corporate  shareholders.   This   section   examines   Congressional   efforts to curtail   some  of these   abuses.  2.   SPECIAL   HOLDING   PERIOD   REQUIREMENTS  The   dividends   received   deduction   may   motivate   corporate shareholders to convert capital gain (taxable at the 21 percent maximum  corporate rate) to tax sheltered divi axable at_a maximum  rate   of 10.5 percent). Assume, for example, that Converter   Corporation  acquires 100 shares of Distributor, Inc.  for $5,250 shortly  before   the stock goes “ex-dividend.”94 Converter holds the stock, collects a $250 dividend,  includes   only 50% ($125) in income, and then sells the   stock for its post-  dividend   value of $5,000, claiming a short-term capital loss of $250  which  is available to offset other capital gains normally taxable at 21   percent. Without any patrolling mechanism, this maneuver enables a corporate  shareholder to convert short-term gain into 50 percent   sheltered   income. An earlier version of Section 246(c) attempted to close   this loophole  by denying any   dividends received deduction unless the   stock was held  for more   than 15 days (90 days for certain preferred stock), but corporations   concocted methods to diminish the risk   of loss during this brief 15-day   holding period. Congress   responded   by increasing the holding   period in Section 246(c) to more   than 45 days   during the 91-day period   beginning on t   ich is 45 days before   the   stock   goes ex-  iV1 : t f certain preferred   stock, the required holdin dividen n he case of certain pref   q   g  91   T.R.C.   § 243(c).  92 T.R.C. § 243(a)(3). The   term “affiliated group” is generally   defined by reference to the  rules governing affiliated corporations that file consolidated tax   returns. I.R.C. § 243(b)(2). A simple example   would be a corporate   parent   and an   80   percent or more subsidiary.   See I.R.C.  § 1504(a). A “qualifying   dividend” must be  paid from   earnings   and profits accumulated with   the  payor   and recipient   corporations are members of  the same affiliated group. I.R.C. § 243(b)(1). 93 The 10.5 percent effective   rate is derived   by   multiplying the   50   percent   includible  portion   of  the  dividends   by the   21  percent maximum corporate rate. 94 The   “ex-dividend”   date is the first date   that a buyer of  the   stock   with   respect to which a dividend   has   been   declared is not   entitled to receive   the  dividend.  9   T.R.C. § 246(c)(1)(A).

Cosy  3.   EXTRAORDINARY   DIVIDENDS:   BASIS   REDUCTIO  If the   dividend   to be received   is extraordinarily   large   in relation   to  the   price   of the   stock,   a corporate   shareholder   may   incur   a minimal   risk  of loss   even   if it holds   the   stock   for more   than   45   days.   This   opportunity was illustrated by a dramatic example of a tax-motivated “dividend stripping” transaction   described in a Congressional committee report:98 Chrysler’s cumulative preferred stock sells at $36 per share  shortly   before Chrysler is scheduled to distribute   $11.69 per  share of back dividends. Corporation X has a short-term capital  gain of $1 million,   on which it will owe tax of $460,000 [the example uses the pre-1987 46 percent   corporate rate.] It buys 85,000   shares of Chrysler   preferred for $3,060,000   and holds it  for 91 days. When the   stock   goes ex-dividend, the price | drops to $24.31 per share. Assume corporation X eventually sells the stock for $24.31. Corporation X has a capital loss of $11.69 per  share, or $993,650, which reduces the tax   on its capital gain to  $2,921, or by $457,079. It receives a dividend of $993,650, of  which 85 percent [now 50 percent.], or $844,603 is excluded. The  tax on the rest of the dividend is $68,562. Thus, the transaction  saves $457,079 of capital gain tax at a price of $68,562 of  dividend tax, a net gain of $388,517.   This   gain is likely to exceed,  by far, whatever   economic consequences’ result from  fluctuations in the market value of Chrysler   preferred during  the 91-day mandatory holding period.  To deter this opportunity for tax arbitrage, Congress   enacted Section  1059, which provides that a corporate shareholder recelving an “extraordinary   dividend” must reduce its basis in the underlying stock (but   not below zero) by the amount of the nontaxed (i.e., deductible) portion of the dividend if the corporation   has not held   the   stock for more than   two   years   before   the “dividend announcement date”—i.e.,   the  96   I.R.C.   § 246(c)(2),  97   I.R.C.   § 246(c)(4).

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  earliest   date   when   the   distributing   corporation   declares,   announces   or  agrees   to the   amount   or payment   of the   dividend.99  To   fully understand   the   workings   of Section   1059,   some   definitions  are   in order.   An   “extraordinary   dividend”   is defined   in terms   of the   size of the   dividend   in   relation   to   the   shareholder’s   adjusted   basis   in   the underlying   stock.   A   dividend   is   extraordinary   if it equals   or   exceeds  certain   threshold   percentages—five percent   of the shareholder’s   adjusted  basis   in the case   of most preferred   stock   and   ten   percent   of the   adjusted  basis in ee   a   cae To prevent easy avoidance   of these  percentage   tests,   all dividends   received   by a shareholder   with   respect   to  any   shares   of stock   which   have   ex-dividend   dates   within   the same   period _of   85   consecutive   days   are   combined   and   treated   as   one   dividend.}01  Under   an   alternate   test,   a taxpayer   may   elect   to determine   the   status   of  a dividend   as   extraordinary   by reference   to the fair market   value   (rather than   the adjusted   basis)   of the   stock   as   of the   day before   the   ex-dividend date.102   This   election   could   be   beneficial   if the   stock   had   appreciated substantially   from   the   time   when   it was   acquired   by the   shareholder. |   The   basis   reduction   required   by   Section   1059   is   only   for   the  “nontaxed   portion”   of an   extraordinary   dividend.   The   “nontaxed   portion”  is the total amount of the dividend reduced by the taxable portion—ie.,  the portion   of the   dividend   includible   in gross   income   after   application   of the   dividends   received   deduction.   The   basis   reduction   occurs   at   the beginning   of the   ex-dividend   date   of the   extraordinary   dividend   to which  the   reduction   relates.1%4   If the   nontaxed   portion   of   an   extraordinary  dividend   exceeds   the shareholder’s   adjusted basis   in the stock, any   excess is treated   as   gain   from   the   sale   or   exchange   of property   in the   taxable year   in which   the   extraordinary   dividend   is received.1%  The general definition of “extraordinary dividend” is broadened in a  few special   situations. Section   1059(e)(1) provides that any amount  treated as  a Section   301   distribution   to a corporate shareholder shall be  an extraordinary   dividend,   irrespective of the shareholder’s   holding period in the   stock or the size  of  the   distribution, if  it is  a distribution in redemption of   stock which is: (1) part of a partial liquidation of  the  99 T.R.C. § 1059(a)(1), (d)(5). A distribution   that otherwise would constitute an extraordinary   dividend will not be considered as such if the shareholder has   held   the   stock  during the  entire existence of the corporation or any   predecessor corporation. I.R.C. § 1059(d)(6).  100   T.R.C.   § 1059(c)(1),   (2).  101 T.R.C. § 1059(c)(3)(A).   In  addition, all dividends   received   with  respect to  a share of stock  which   have   ex-dividend dates during the same period of 365   consecutive   days are treated as extraordinary if the aggregate of such   dividends   exceeds 20 percent of  the basis in such stock.  LR.C. § 1059(c)(3)(B). These rules are extended to include   dividends   received   with   respect to shares of  stock having a substituted basis.   I.R.C. § 1059(c)(3)(C). 102 T.R.C. § 1059(c)(4).   This   option is available   only if the taxpayer   establishes   the fair  market value of  the stock to the satisfaction   of  the Commissioner.  108   T.R.C.   § 1059(b). 104   T.R.C.   § 1059(d)(1). 105 T.R.C. § 1059(a)(2).   This   treatment   avoids   the   tax   taboo   of  a negative   basis.   Cf.   I.R.C.  §  357(c)   and   Chapter   2D,   supra.  183

Two   other   special   rules   carve   out   liberalizing   exceptions.   First,  certain   distributions   between   an   affiliated   group   of c   rations_that  qualify for the 100   percent   dividends   received   deduction   under   Section  243(b)(1)   are   not   treated   as   extraordinary   dividends.109   Second,_special relief is provided   for “qualified   preferred   dividends,”   which   are   defined   as dividends   payable with   respect   to any   share   of stock   which   provides   for fixed   preferred   dividends   payable   not   less   than   annually   and   was   not acquired   with   dividends in arrears.110   A “qualified   preferred   dividend”   is not   treated   as   an   extraordinary   dividend   if the dividends   received   by the shareholder   during   the   period   it   owned   the stock   do   not   exceed an  annualized rate   of   15 percent older’s  adjusted bacis oF te ieradetion bee ot ey   eee stock  is held by the shareholder for_over-five_years.111 The theory for this  complex exception is that, unlike the   typical extraordinary dividend, a qualified preferred   dividend offers no potential for effectively purchasing a dividend that accrued prior to the  date on which the stock was acquired.  4. DEBT-FINANCED   PORTFOLIO   STOCK  Corporate   shareholders   have also in the  past   exploited   the dividends  received deduction by borrowing funds to acquire   dividend paying stock.  The strategy   basically has  been to debt  finance the purchase of stock   that  pays a significant   dividend. The goals of the corporate   shareholder   have  been to both (1) be able to deduct the   interest paid on   the   debt incurred  in the purchase,   and (2) obtain the  dividends   received   deduction for  dividends paid on the stock. Absent the impact of  taxes,   the transaction  normally   would not make economic sense because the corporate  shareholder’s interest expense   would be   greater than the dividend  *  106 “Partial   liquidation” is defined for  this purpose   under the tests   in Section 302(e). See  Chapter 5D, infra.  107 The tax consequences of  stock redemptions are covered in Chapter 5, infra.  108 T.R.C. § 1059(e)(1)(A)(iii). Section   304 is covered in Chapter 5G, infra.  109   -T.R.C.   § 1059(e)(2). 10   T.R.C. § 1059(e)(3)(C)(i).  111 T.R.C. § 1059(e)(3)(A), (B).   If  all these   requirements are met   except for   the   five-year  holding   period,   the   exclusion   from   extraordinary   dividend   treat   il imi  Ser aa y   eatment is more limited.

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  payout.   But   if the   interest   expense   is fully deductible   and   only a portion  of the   dividend   is taxable,   the   arrangement   can   possibly   become   a low risk arbitrage   maneuver.   If the net benefit   of the dividend   (that is hightly taxed   by virtue   of the   dividends   received   deduction)   exceeds   the   cost   of the   interest   expense   (after   the   corporation’s   deduction),   the   corporate shareholder   will   reap   the   after-tax   profit.   One   of the   effects   of the   Tax Cuts   and   Jobs   Act’s reduction   in the corporate   tax rate   to 21 percent   is to limit the efficacy of this strategy   by reducing   the tax benefit   derived   from  the   corporate   deduction   for   interest   expense.   Nevertheless,   the   Code  continues   to guard   against   the   abuse   of debt   financing   dividends   eligible  for the   dividends   received   deduction.  Section   246A   precludes   this   strategy   by   reducing   a   corporation’s  dividends   received   deduction   to the extent   dividends are attributable   to  Sea   Eee   a d portfolio   stock.”   A   similar   policy   is reflected   in Section  265(a)(2),   which   denies   a deduction   for interest   incurred   to purchase   or  carry   tax-exempt   municipal   bonds.   Thus,   if “portfolio   stock”   is entirely debt-financed,   Section   246A   denies   any   dividends   received   deduction.   If  it is debt-financed   in some   lesser   percentage,   then   that   same   percentage  of the   dividends   received   deduction   is denied.!!2   In   all events,   however,  the   reduction   in   the   dividends   received   deduction   may   not   exceed   the amount   of any   interest   deduction   allocable   to   the   dividend   (..e.,   to the  borrowed   funds   directly   attributable   to the   stock).113 Stock   is “debt-financed”   if it is “portfolio   stock”   that   is encumbered by   “portfolio   indebtedness”   during   a   “base   period”   prescribed   in   the statute.114   “Portfolio   stock”   is defined   as any   stock   of a corporation   unless  the   corporate   shareholder   owns   either:   (1) 50   percent   of the   total voting  power   and   value   of the   corporation   or   (2) at least   20 percent   of the   total voting   power   and   value   and   five   or fewer   corporate   shareholders   own   at least   50   percent   of   the   voting   power   and   value,   excluding   preferred  stock.115   “Portfolio   indebtedness”   means   any   indebtedness   directly attributable   to the investment in the portfolio   stock.116 This   means   that  the   stock   must   have   been   purchased   with   borrowed   funds   or   that   the borrowing   must   be   directly   traceable   to   the   acquisition,   such   as   where the   stock   was   pledged   as   security   for a subsequently   incurred   debt   in a case   where   the   corporation   reasonably   could   have   been   expected   to sell  the   stock   rather   than   incur   the indebtedness.!17  To illustrate, assume that Leverage   Corporation acquires   100 shares  of  publicly   traded X Corp.   stock for $10,000,   paying   $6,000   cash   from  corporate   funds and borrowing the $4,000   balance. X Corp.   pays  Leverage an annual   dividend of $1,000. The stock is ‘debt-financed to the  12   T.R.C.   § 246A(a),   (d). 113   T.R.C.   § 246A(e). 114   T.R.C.   § 246A(c)(1),   (d)(4). 115   [.R.C.   § 246A(c)(2),   (4). 6   T.R.C.   § 246A(d)(3)(A).  117.

186   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  extent   of $4,000.   The   percentage   of debt-financing   is thus A0 percent (the  “average   portfolio   indebtedness,”   as   defined   by Section   246A(d)).   Under  the convoluted   formula   in Section   246A(a),   Leverage   subtracts   40 percent  from   100   percent   and   then   multiplies   the   result   (60 percent   here)   by the  usual   50   percent   dividends   received   deduction   percentage,   to   reach   30 percent.   That   lower   figure   is substituted   for   50   percent   in   determining  Leverage’s   Section   243   deduction.   When   Leverage   receives   its   $1,000  dividend,   it may   deduct   only   $300   (rather   than   the   usual   $500).  5.   SECTION   301(e)  The   adjustments   to earnings   and   profits   required   by Sections   312(k)  and   312(n)   for   depreciation   and   other   timing   items   frequently   result   in an   increase   to   a   corporation’s   earnings   and   profits!48   and   may   cause earnings   and   profits   to   exceed   the   corporation’s   taxable   income.   For  example,   a   corporation   that   reports   a   gain   on   the   installment   method  may   not   defer   the   gain   for   purposes   of determining   its   earnings   and profits.119   The   increase   in   earnings   and   profits   resulting   from   these  adjustments   often   ensures   that   a   distribution   will   be   fully   taxable   as   a  dividend   to noncorporate   shareholders.   Because   of the dividends   received  deduction,   this   may   prove   to   be   a   bonanza   to   a   corporate   shareholder.  The   following   example   from   the legislative   history   illustrates   one   type   of  abuse   that   concerned   Congress:!20 For example, assume that P  Corporation   owns 100 percent  of the   stock of X Corporation, that P’s basis in such stock is $400  [Ed.], that P and X file separate income tax returns, and that X  has no current or accumulated earnings   and profits. Assume  further that X sells an   asset for a $1,000   installment note,  realizing an $800 gain.   Finally, assume that X borrows   $500 secured by the installment note and distributes   the $500 to P.  Under [Section   312(n)(5)], absent a special rule, X Corporation’s earnings   and profits would be increased by the amount of gain on   the installment sale, and   P would treat the $500 distribution  as   a dividend. Thus   P   would include   the $500 in income but would likely qualify fora 100-percent   dividends   received deduction. If P later   sold its X stock for $400 [Ed.] (the value of that   stock if  it  is assumed that X will ultimately   have a $100 [Ed.] tax liability, in present   value   terms, on account of the installment sale), it would not recognize   gain or loss  on   the sale.  As a result,   P would   have realized   an   overall   profit   of $500.  8 The   purpose of these  adjustments is to ensure that a corporation’s   earnings   and profits  more   accurately reflect its true economic   performance.   See   Section B of this chapter,   supra.  119" T.R.C. §  312m) (5).  ae Staff   of the Joint   Committee on Taxation,   General   Explanation of   the Revenue  Provisions   of  the   Deficit Reduction   Act   of  1984   (hereinafter   “1984   Act   General   Explanation’).  The   example   has   been   edited to  reflect   the   now   21   percent   corporate   tax   rate.

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  Section   301(e)   prevents   the result illustrated   above   by providing   that the adjustments   required   by Sections   312(k)   and   312(n)   shall not be made  for purposes   of determining   the taxable   income   of (and the adjusted   basis  of stock   held   by) any   “20 percent   corporate   shareholder.”!21   A 20 percent  corporate   shareholder   is any   corporation   entitled   to a dividends   received  deduction   with   respect   to   a   distribution   that   owns,   directly   or   through  the   Section   318   attribution   rules,   either   (1)   stock   in   the   distributing corporation   possessing   at   least   20   percent   of the   total   combined   voting power,   or (2) at least   20 percent   of the total value   of all of the distributing  corporation’s   stock,   except   nonvoting   preferred   stock.122 The   general   effect   of   Section   301(e)   is   to   reduce   the   distributing  corporation’s   earnings   and   profits   in   determining   the   tax   consequences of distributions   to 20   percent   corporate   shareholders.   This   reduction,   in  turn,   may   cause   a distribution   to be treated   as   a return   of capital coupled  with   a   reduction   in   the   basis   of the   distributing   corporation’s   stock.  Without   Section   301(e),   the   same   distribution   likely   would   have   been   a tax-free   dividend   with   no   basis   reduction.   Thus,   applying   Section   301(e) to the   earlier   example,   X   Corporation   will   have   no   earnings   and   profits for purposes   of determining   the   tax   consequences   of a distribution   to P  Corporation.   In   the   absence   of   earnings   and   profits,   $400   of   the  distribution   by X to P will be   a return   of capital   under   Section   301(c)(2),  and   $100   will   be   taxed   to   P   as   gain   from   the   sale   or   exchange   of its X  stock   under   Section   301(c)(3).   P’s basis   in its X stock   will   be   reduced   to zero   and   it will recognize   a $400   gain   on   the   later   sale of the   stock.!?3  PROBLEM  On June 1, Publicly Held Corporation’s common stock is selling for $15  per   share. On that date, Publicly Held declares a dividend of $1 per share, payable on June 12 to shareholders of record as of June 8. Investor Corporation   purchases 1,000   shares of Publicly Held common stock for  $15,000 on June 3 (two days before   the June 5 ex-dividend date),   collects a  $1,000   dividend on June 12 and sells the   stock for $14,000 on June 15.  (a) What are the   tax consequences to Investor Corporation?  (b) What result in (a), above, if Investor sold the stock on December 1; instead of June 15?  (c) What result   in (b), above, if Publicly Held had paid a second  $1 per share   dividend on August 15, and the ex-dividend date  was August 5? ) aokeg ‘  (d) What result  in (c), above, if the August dividend is $2 per share  but Investor   holds   the  Publicly   Held stock for 25 months before selling it?  121   T.R.C.   § 301(e)(1). 122   T.R.C.   § 301(e)(2). 123 1984   Act   General   Explanation,   supra   note   120,   at 183.

United   States  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Fifth   Circuit,   1980.  624   F.2d   1328.  m= RANDALL,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE:  This   case   presents   the   question   whether_assets   distributed   to   a  corporation by its   subsidiary,   immediately   prior   to the   sale   by such  corporation   of all the capital stock of such subsidiary,   should   be treated,  for   federal   income   tax purposes,   as   a   dividend   or, as the district   court  held,   as   part   of the   consideration   received   from   the   sale   of such   capital  stock.   We   hold   that   on   the   facts   of this   case,   the   assets   so   distributed  constituted   a dividend   and   we   reverse   the judgment   of the   district   court. In 1969,   TSN   Liquidating   Corporation,   Inc.   (“TSN”),   which   was   then  named   “Texas   State   Network,   Inc.,” owned   over 90%   of the   capital   stock of Community   Life   Insurance   Company   (“CLIC”),   an   insurance   company  chartered   under   the   laws   of   the   State   of   Maine.   In   early   1969,  negotiations   began   for   the   purchase   of   CLIC   by   Union   Mutual   Life  Insurance   Company   (“Union   Mutual’).   On   May   5,   1969,   TSN   and   the  other   CLIC   stockholders   entered   into   an   Agreement   of Stock   Purchase  (the “Stock   Purchase   Agreement”)   with   Union   Mutual   for the   sale   of the  capital   stock   of CLIC   to Union   Mutual.   The   Stock   Purchase   Agreement  provided   that there would he no material   adverse   change in   the business  qr_ass   he   closing   “   1   rtain  shares   an   j   1   i   tion   ‘4,(1).’ above   will   not   be a part of the assets   of [CLIC].”   Since   the purchase   price of the capital   stock  of CLIC   under   the   Stock   Purchase   Agreement   was   based   primarily   on  the   book   value   (or,   in   some   instances,   market   value)   of   those   assets  owned   by   CLIC   on   the   closing   date,   the   purchase   price   would   be automatically   reduced   by the   elimination   of such   shares   and   notes   from  the   assets   of CLIC.   On   May   14,   1969,   as_contemplated   by the Stock  he Board   of Directors   of CLIC   declar   ividend  in   to   stockholders   of record   as   of   69   consisting 1   le   to  primarily   of capital   stock   in small,   public companies   traded   infrequently  in small 1 e over-the-counter   market. On May 20, 1969,  the   closing was held and   Union   Mutual   purchased substantially all the  outstanding capital stock o _ including the shares   held by TSN.   The  final purchase price paid by  Union   Mutual to the   selling stockholders of  CLIC was   $823,822, of which   TSN’s   share   was   $747,436. Union   Mutual thereupon   contributed to the   capital   of CLIC $1,120,000 in municipal bonds   and   purchased   from CLIC additional   capital   stock   of CLIC for $824,598 in  cash   paid to CLIC.  In its income tax   return for  the fiscal year   ended   J  uly  31,   1969, TSN reported its receipt   of  assets   from   CLIC as   a dividend   and   claimed   the 85%   dividends   received   deduction   available   to   corporate   stockholders

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  pursuant   to   § 248(a)(1)   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   of 1954.   TSN   also  reported   its   gain   on   the   sale   of   the   capital   stock   of   CLIC   on   the installment   method   pursuant   to   § 453   of the   Code.   [Under   current   law,  installment   sale   treatment   would   not   be   allowed   if the   CLIC   stock   were  publicly   traded.   I.R.C.   § 453(k)(2).   Ed.]   On   audit,   the   Internal   Revenue Service   treated   the distribution   of the assets   from   CLIC   to TSN   as having been   an   integral   part of the sale by TSN   of capital   stock   of CLIC   to Union  Mutual,   added   its   estimate   ($1,677,082)   of the   fair   market   value   of the  assets   received   by TSN   to   the   cash   ($747,436)   received   by TSN   on   the  sale,   and   disallowed   the   use   by   TSN   of   the   installment   method   for reporting   the   gain   on   the   sale   of   the   capital   stock   of   CLIC   since ageregating   the   fair market   value   of the   distributed   assets   and   the   cash resulted   in more   than   30%   of the   proceeds   from   the   sale   being   received in the   year   of sale.   TSN   paid   the   additional   tax   due   as   a result   of such treatment   by the Internal   Revenue   Service,   filed a claim   for a refund   and  subsequently   instituted   this action   against   the Internal   Revenue   Service. The   district   court   made   the following   findings   of fact in part   II of its opinion: With   regard   to   the   negotiations   between   CLIC   and   Union  Mutual   in early   1969,   the   Court   finds   that   Union   Mutual   was interested   in   purchasing   CLIC   and   proposed   a   formula   for  valuing   the   assets,   liabilities,   and   insurance   in   force,   which,  together   with   an   additional   amount,   would   be the   price paid for  the   CLIC   stock. The   investment   portfolio   of   CLIC   was   heavily   oriented  toward   equity   investments   in   closely   held   over-the-counter  securities.   At least in the mind   of CLIC’s   officers,   the makeup   of  CLIC’s   investment   portfolio   was   affecting   its   ability   to   obtain  licenses   in various   states.   As   early   as   the   Spring   of 1968,   the management   and   principal   stockholders   of CLIC   had   begun   to  seek   a   solution   to the   investment   portfolio   problem.   The   Court  finds,   however,   that   CLIC   had   never   formulated   a definite   plan  on   how   to solve   its investment   portfolio   problem.  Union   Mutual did   not like CLIC’s   investment portfolio but  considered   bonds to be more in keeping with  insurance   industry responsibilities. The management of CLIC regarded the Union  Mutual offer   as   a good one, and tried without success to get  Union   Mutual to take   the   entire investment portfolio. Accordingly, the   [Stock Purchase   Agreement] required  CLIC to dispose   some of  the investment portfolio   assets. Thus, the price that would be  paid for the CLIC stock   was   based   upon a formula   which   valued   the   assets   after excluding   certain  stocks.  Fee   yas  189

190   TAXATION   OF C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Plaintiffs   disposition   of the   undesirable   over-the-counter  stock   was   necessitated   by   its   sale   arrangements   with   Union  Mutual.   Plaintiff   had   no   definite   plans   prior   to its negotiations  with   Union   Mutual   as to how   to get rid of the undesirable   stock,  when   it was   to get rid of the   undesirable   stock,   or   even   that   it  would   definitely   get   rid   of the   undesirable   stock.   Accordingly,  the   Court   finds   that   the   dividend   in kind   of 14   May   1969   was  part   and   parcel   of the purchase   agreement   with   Union   Mutual.  TSN   Liquidating   Corp.   v.   United   States,   77-2   U.S.Tax   Cas.   § 9741  at   88,523   (N.D.Tex.1977).   In   part   III   of its   opinion,   the   district   court made   the following   additional   findings: Union   Mutual   was   interested   in purchasing   the   stock   of an approximately   $2   million   corporation   in   order   that   that corporation   might   be licensed   to do business   in other   states.   As  of 30   April   1969,   CLIC   had   assets   of $2,115,138.   On   14   May  1969,   CLIC   declared   a   dividend   valued   at   approximately   $1.8 million.   As   a result   of this   dividend,   CLIC   was   left with   assets totaling   approximately   $300,000.   The   final   purchase   price   paid by   Union   Mutual   to   the   selling   shareholders   of   CLIC   was  $823,822.   In addition,   Union   Mutual   contributed   $1,120,000   of  municipal   bonds   to   the   capital   of   CLIC   and   purchased  additional   shares   of   stock   of   CLIC   for   $824,598.   Thus,  subsequent   to   closing   on   20   May   1969,   CLIC   was   worth  $2,400,000.   Thus,   CLIC   was   worth   $2   million   when   the   [Stock  Purchase   Agreement]   was   signed   on   5 May   1969   and   worth   over  $2 million   immediately   after   closing. There   was no business   purpose served in  this case by the  dividend   declared by CLIC prior to the sale   of all   its stock to  Union Mutual. It  is evident that   the dividend   benefitted the shareholders of CLIC and not CLIC itself. There   was no benefit or business   purpose in CLIC’s declaration of the dividend  separate   and apart from the sale. The   Court finds that   the  dividend would not, and could not, have   been made without the  sale.  **¥*  What actually happened in   the period   5 through 20 May  1969   was that the stockholders   received   $1.8 million in virtually  tax-free   stocks, as well as over $800,000 in cash, for   a   total   of  approximately $2.6   million. This   was   certainly a  fair price for  a  corporation   valued at the  time of sale  at $2,115,138,   and reflects a premium paid for good will and policies   in  force,   as well as the fact   that CLIC   was an   existing   business   with   licenses   in  eight or nine   states. Hence, a $2  million   corporation   was sold   for  $2.6  million   including   the   dividend   and   the  cash.

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS   191  After   noting   the   time-honored   principle   that   the   incidence   of  taxation   is to be   determined   by the   substance   of the   transaction   rather than   by   its   form   and   the   related   principle   that   the   transaction   is generally   to   be   viewed   as   a   whole   and   not   to   be   separated   into   its component   parts,   the   district   court   held: The   distribution   of   assets   to   [TSN]   from   its   subsidiary, CLIC,   immediately   prior to [TSN’s]   disposition   of its entire   stock interest   in CLIC   should   be treated   as a part of the gain from   the  sale   of the   stock.   Thus,   the   Court   concludes   that   the   in-kind  distribution   of   14   May   1969   to   the   stockholders   of   CLIC   is taxable   to   [TSN]   as   gain   from   the   sale   of its stock.   The   alleged dividend   was   merely   intented   [sic]   to   be   part   of the   purchase price paid by Union   Mutual   to CLIC   for its stock. The   district   court   relied   for   its   holding   primarily   on   the   cases   of  Waterman   Steamship   Corp.   v.   Commissioner,   480   F.2d   1185   (5th  Cir.1970),   cert.   denied,   401   U.S.   939,   91 S.Ct.   936,   28 L.Ed.2d   219   (1971),  and   Basic,   Inc.   v. United   States,   549   F.2d   740   (Ct.C1.1977),   all discussed  infra.  On   appeal,   TSN   argues   that   the   cases   relied   upon   by   the   district  court   are   exceptions   to what   TSN   characterizes   as   the   established   rule, namely,   that   assets   removed   from   a corporation   by a   dividend   made   in  contemplation   of a sale of the stock   of that   corporation,   when   those   assets  are   in   good   faith   to   be   retained   by   the   selling   stockholders   and   not  thereafter   transferred   to the buyer,   are   taxable   as   a dividend   and   not   as a   part   of the   price   paid   for   the   stock   for   the   reason   that,   in   economic reality   and   in   substance,   the   selling   stockholders   did   not   sell   and   the buyer   did not purchase   or pay for the excluded   assets.   The   principal cases cited by TSN   for its position   are   Gilmore   v.   Commissioner,   25   RO1321  (1956),   Coffey   v.   Commissioner,   14   T.C.   1410   (1950),   and   Rosenbloom  Finance   Corp.   v.   Commissioner,   24 B.T.A.   763   (1931).   According   to TSN,  the controlling   distinction   between   the   Coffey line of cases   relied upon   by TSN   and   the   Waterman   line   of cases   relied   upon   by the   district   court   is whether   the buyer   negotiated   to acquire   and   pay   for the   stock,   exclusive  of the   assets   distributed   out   as   a dividend,   on   the   one   hand,   or   whether  the buyer negotiated   to acquire   and pay for the stock, including   the assets which   were   then   the   subject   of a   sham   distribution   designed   to   evade  taxes,   on   the other   hand.   In the former   case,   according   to TSN,   there   is a taxable   dividend;   in the latter   case   there   is not.  We begin  by noting   that the district court was certainly   correct   in its position   that   the substance of  the   transaction   controls   over   the form   and that   the   transaction e, rather   than   being  separated into its parts.   Further,   having   reviewed the   record,   we are   of the   view   that   the   operative facts found so carefully by the   district   court  are   entirely   accurate   (except   for  the   valuation   of the   distributed   assets, as   to which   we   express   no   opinion). We differ   with   the   district   court   only  in the   legal   characterization   of  those   facts   and   in the   conclusion   to  be

192  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  drawn therefrom. We agree with TSN that this case is controlled by the  Coffey, Gilmore   and Rosenbloom cases rather than by the Waterman and Basic cases relied upon by the district court.  In Coffey, the principal case relied upon   by TSN, the taxpayers owned the   stock of Smith Brothers   Refinery Co., Inc. and were negotiating for the sale of such stock. Representatives of the purchasers and representatives of the sellers examined and discussed the various  assets owned by Smith Brothers   Refinery Co., Inc., and the liabilities of the company, with a view to reaching an agreement upon  the fair market  value of the stock. During these   negotiations, the representatives of the  purchasers   and of the sellers could not agree upon the value of certain  assets (including a contingent receivable   referred to   as the Cabot  payment).   The representatives of the purchasers   informed the  representatives of the sellers that  the sellers could   withdraw those assets from the  assets of the company and that they would   buy the stock without  those  assets being a part.of the sale, thereby eliminating   the necessity  for arriving at a valuation of those assets in determining the value of the stock on a net worth basis. The contract of   sale provided that   the unwanted assets would be distributed by the corporation as   a dividend prior to the sale   of the stock. The selling stockholders contended before the  tax  court, as the Internal Revenue Service   does in the  case before this  court, that   the Cabot payment distributed to them as   a dividend in kind was   “part of the consideration   for stock   sold   and   that   any   profit r   ing from   its   receipt   by   them   is   taxable   as   a   capital   gain.”   The   tax   court  rejecte a I it was   contrary to the substance of the  transaction:  We do not agree   with petitioners   that they   received the  Cabot payment as part of the consideration for the sale   of  their stock. The   purchasers did not agree to buy their stock and then  turn over to them $190,000   and the Cabot payment in  consideration therefor. From the testimony   above set forth it is  apparent that they   were not interested in the Cabot payment,  did   not want it included in the   assets   of the corporation at the  time   they   acquired its stock, and   negotiated   with   petitioners to acquire stock of a corporation whose assets   did   not include   the unwanted Cabot   payment. * * * They received $190,000 for their stock. Under the contract of sale, they did   not sell or part   with  their   interest in the Cabot contract. It was   expressly   reserved  by  them   and   was a distribution   they  received as stockholders by  virtue   of  the   reservation. Coffey,   14 T.C. at 1417,   1418. The tax   court   held   the   distribution to bea  dividend.   [The   court   then   discussed   two   other   cases reaching   the same conclusion on   similar facts. Ed.] * *  *  The Internal   Revenue Service   states   that it does   not   disagree   with the  holdings in  Coffey, Gilmore   and   Rosenbloom,   but it takes   the position that   they   do   not   apply   in   the   circumstances   of this   case. The   Internal

CHAPTER   4   NONLIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS  Revenue   Service   focuses   on   the   receipt   by   the   selling   stockholders   of  CLIC   of investment   assets,   followed   immediately   by an infusion   by Union  Mutual   of a like   amount   of investment   assets   into   CLIC,   and   says   that  the   reinfusion   of   assets   brings   the   case   before   the   court   within   the  “conduit   rationale”   of Waterm   .   In   Waterman,   Waterman   Steamship  Corporation   (“Waterman”)   was   the   owner   of all the   outstanding   capital  stock   of Pan-Atlantic   Steamship   Corporation   (“Pan-Atlantic”)   and   Gulf  Florida   Terminal   Company,   Incorporated   (“Gulf   Florida”).   Malcolm   P.  McLean   made   an   offer   to   Waterman   to_purchase   all   the_outstanding  capital   stock   of   Pan-Atlantic   and   Gulf   Florida   for   $38,500,000.   Since  Waterman’s   tax basis   for the   stock   of the   subsidiaries   totaled $700,000,  a   sale   of the   capital   stock   of the   subsidiaries   for   $3,500,000   would   have  produced   a   taxable   gain   of   approximately   $2,800,000.   Because   the treasury   regulations   on   consolidated   returns   provided   that   the   dividends received   from   an   affiliated   corporation   are   exempt   from   tax,   a   sale   of capital   stock   of the   subsidiaries   for   $700,000,   after   a dividend   payment  to Waterman   by the   subsidiaries   of $2,800,000,   would,   at least in theory,  have   produced   no   taxable   gain.   The   Board   of Directors   of Waterman  rejected   McLean’s   offer, but   authorized   Waterman’s   president   to submit  a   counter   proposal   providing   for   the   sale   of all the   capital   stock   in the  subsidiaries for$700,000, butonly after the subsidiaries paid   dividends to   Waterman   in   the   aggregate   amount   of   $2,800,000.   As   finally  consummated, the dividends   and the sale of the capital   stock   of the  subsidiaries   took   the following   form:  (1)   Pan-Atlantic   gave   a   promissory   note to Waterman   for  $2,800,000   payable   in 30   days   as   a “dividend.” Sng: ecg bes   ree   as 2  (2)   One   hour   later,   Waterman   agree  capital   stock   of Pan-Atlantic   and   Gulf   Flori   r   $700,000. tock of Pan-Atlantic and Gul  (3) Thirty minutes later, after the  closing of the sale  of the  capital   stock of  the subsidiaries had occurred, Pan-Atlantic held  a-special meeting of its new   Board of Directors, and the Board  authorized   Pan-Atlantic to borrow   $2,800,000 from   McLean and  a corporation controlled by  McLean. Those funds were   used by Pan-Atlantic   promptly to pay off the $2,800,000 note to  Waterman (which   was not yet due). ~  In its tax return for the fiscal year   involved, Waterman eliminated   from  income the $2,800,000   received as   a dividend   from   Pan-Atlantic   and  reported   $700,000 as the   sales   price   of   the   capital   stock   of   the two subsidiaries.   Since Waterman’s tax   basis for the   stock was the same as the   sales   price   therefor,   no taxable   gain   was realized   on   the sale. On  audit,   the  Internal Revenue Service   took   the  position   that Waterman had realized a  long-   capital gain of $2,800,000 on the   sale   of  the   capital  stock   of  the   subsidiaries   and   increased its taxable   income   accordingly.  On   appeal   from a judgment   by  the tax  court   in favor of  the taxpayer, the  Internal   Revenue   Service   contended   that   the   rules   applicable to situations   where a  regular   dividend   has been   declared   are   not   applicable  193

--- Page 264 ---

194  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  when the parties contemplate that a purported dividend is to be inextricably tied to the purchase price and where, as was the case before  the court, the amount of the dividend is not a true distribution of  corporate profits. The Internal Revenue Service argued   that the funds were   supplied by the buyer of the stock, with the corporation acting as   a  mere conduit for passing th payment through to the seller. This court  agreed   with   the Internal   Revenue   Service:  The   so-called   dividend   and   sale   were   one   transaction.   The   note  was   but   one   transitory   step   in a total,   pre-arranged   plan   to sell  the   stock.   We   hold   that   in   substance   Pan-Atlantic   neither declared   nor   paid   a dividend   to Waterman,   but   rather   acted   as  a   mere   conduit   for   the   payment   of   the   purchase   price   to  Waterman.  Waterman,   430   F.2d   at   1192.   The   opinion   of this   court   began   with   this  sentence:  This   case   involves   another   attempt   by a taxpayer   to ward   off tax blows   with   paper   armor.  Id. at   1185.   The   opinion   stressed   the   sham,   tax   motivated   aspects   of the  transaction:  Here,   McLean   originally   offered   Waterman   $3,500,000   for  the   stock   of   Pan-Atlantic   an   ulf   Florida.   Waterman  recognized   that   since   its basis for tax purposes   in the stock was $700,180, a taxable   gain   of   approximately   $2,800,000   would  result   from   the   sale.   It declined   the   original   offer   and   proposed  to cast   the sale of the   stock   in a two   step transaction.   Waterman  proposed   to   McLean   that   it would   sell   the   stock   of the   two  subsidiaries   for $700,180   after it had   extracted   $2,800,000   of the subsidiaries’   earnings   and   profits.   It   is   undisputed   that  Waterman   intended   to sell the   two   subsidiaries   for the   origi  dividend   which would   be eliminated   from   income   under   Section  1502-   Waterman   also   intended   that   none of the assets   owned   by  the   subsidiaries   would   be   removed   prior   to the   sale.   Although  the   distribution   was cast in the form of a dividend,   the  distribution   was   to be financed   by McLean   with   payment   being made   to Waterman   through   Pan-Atlantic.   To   inject   substance  into   the   form   of the   transaction,   Pan-Atlantic   issued   its note   to  Waterman   before   the   closing   agreement   wag   signed.   The  creation   of a   valid   indebtedness   however,   cannot   change   the  true   nature   of the   transaction.   * * *  KK *  The form of  the   transaction   used   by the   parties is relatively  unimportant, for   the   true   substance   and effect   of   their  agreement   was   that McLean   would   pay   $3,500,000 for  all  of  the

A   final  footnote   to the   opinion   stated   that   the   decision   should   not   be interpreted  as   standing   for the proposition   that a corporation   which   is contemplating  a   sale   of   its   subsidiary’s   stock   could   not   under   any   circumstances distribute   its   subsidiaries’   profits   prior   to the   sale   without   having   such  distribution   deemed   part   of the   purchase   price.   Id. at 1196   n.   21.  In summary,   in Waterman,   the   substance   of the transaction,   and   the  way   in which   it was   originally   negotiated,   was   that   the   purchaser   would  pay   $3,500,000   of its money   to the   seller   in exchange   for all the   stock   of  the   two   subsidiaries   and   none   of the   assets   of those   subsidiaries   was   to  be   removed   and   retained   by the   sellers.   In the   case   before   the   court,   the  district   court   found   that   Union   Mutual   did not   want   and   would   not   pay  for   the   assets   of CLIC   which   were   distributed   to   TSN   and   the   other stockholders   of   CLIC.   Those   assets   were   retained   by   the   selling stockholders.   The   fact   that   bonds   and   cash   were   reinfused   into   CLIC  after   the   closing,   in lieu   of the   unwanted   capital   stock   of small,   publicly  held   corporations,   does   not   convert   this   case   from   a   Coffey   situation,   in  which   admittedly   unwanted   assets   were   distributed   by the   corporation  to its   stockholders   and   retained   by them,   into   a   Waterman   situation,   in  which   the   distribution   of assets   was   clearly   a   sham,   designed   solely   to achieve   a   tax   free   distribution   of   assets   ultimately   funded   by   the  purchaser.   Indeed,   the   Internal   Revenue   Service   does   not   argue,   in the  case   before   the   court,   that   the   transaction   was   in   any   respect   a   sham.  Instead,   the   Service   would   have   us   hold   that   the   mere   infusion   of assets  into   the   acquired   company   after   the   closing,   assets   which   are   markedly  different   in   kind   from   the   assets   that   were   distributed   prior   to   the closing,   should   result   in the   disallowance   of dividend   treatment   for the distribution   of the   unwanted   assets,   and   the   Service   cites   Waterman   as  authority   for   that   proposition.   We_vi   sham   ect—the   hollow  sound—of   the   transaction   described in   Waterman   as   one   of the   critical  €cision, and we decline   to  extend the Waterman rule toa  The Internal Revenue Service also   cites Basic as authority for the  disallowance of dividend   treatment for the   distribution   of  the unwanted assets   in   this   case. * * * [The   court   distinguished   the   Court of Claims  decision   in  Basic   on   the ground that   the   asset   distributed as   a pre-sale  dividend in  Basic   was   promptly   transferred to   the   buyer   while   in this case   the   distributed   assets   were   retained   by   the   target   corporation’s  shareholders.

196  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  As additional support for its position, the   court in Basic   focused on the absence of a business purpose, viewed from the standpoint of Falls,  for chacuaraian otra aiaend a eenaenls   corporate asset, i.e., the  capital stock of Carbon, by Falls to Basic. The district court, in the case  before this court, applied the same test to the payment of the dividend of the unwanted assets by CLIC to TSN, the controlling stockholder of  CLIC, and   found that, strictly from the standpoint of CLIC, the dividend  was lacking in business purpose and,   indeed,   could not have   taken place  apart from the sale and the subsequent infusion of investment assets into CLIC by  Union Mutual. However, it seems to us to be inconsistent to take the position   that substance must control   over form and that a transaction must be viewed as   a whole,   rather than in parts, and at the same time to  state that the business purpose of one participant_in a multi-party  transaction (particularly where the participant is a corporation controlled by the taxpayer   and is not itself a party to the sale transaction)  is to be viewed in isolation from the over-all business  purpose for the  entire transaction. We agree that   the transaction must be viewed as   a  whole   and we accept the district court’s finding of fact that   the dividend of the unwanted assets was “part and parcel of the   purchase arrangement  with Union Mutual” "indtivaled "asecreelh tee Union   Mutual’s  unwillingness to take and pay for such   assets. That being the case, we  decline to focus   on the business purpose of one participant in the transaction—a corporation controlled by the taxpayer—and instead find  that  the business purpose for the transaction as a whole, viewed   from the  standpoint of the taxpayer, controls. The facts found by the district court clearly demonstrate a business purpose for the presale dividend of the unwanted assets which fully explains that dividend. We note   that there  is no suggestion in the district court’s opinion of any   tax avoidance _  motivation on the part of the  taxpayer  TSN.   The fact that the dividend  may have   had incidental tax  benefit to the taxpayer, without more,   does  not necessitate the disallowance of dividend   treatment.  Having concluded that   the   pre-sale   distribution by CLIC to its  stockholders   (including TSN) of assets which   Union   Mutual did  not want,  would not pay for and did   not ultimately receive is   a dividend for tax  purposes, and not   part of  the purchase price  of the capital   stock of CLIC, we   reverse   the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent   with this opinion.  Reversed   and   remanded.  NOTE  Life is not as simple   today as it was when the  successful   tax plan in TSN  Liquidating   was   concocted.   Several   additional   provisions of  the Code   now must   be   considered in evaluating   the continuing viability   of   a pre-sale distribution   of unwanted assets by a corporate   shareholder.

CHAPTER 4 NONLIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS  As   noted   earlier,!24   Section   301(e)   requires,   solely   for   purposes   of  computing   the   amount   of any   taxable   dividend   income   to   a   20   percent   or  more   corporate   shareholder   and   the   shareholder’s   basis   in the   stock   of the  distributing   corporation,   that   the   distributing   corporation’s   earnings   and profits   must   be   determined   without   regard   to   the   special   adjustments   in  Sections   312(k)   and   312(n).   Section   301(e),   however,   will   not   necessarily  impair   the technique   used   in TSN   Liquidating;   it merely   limits   the utility of  pre-acquisition   dividend:   strips   to   situations   where   the   distributing  corporation   has   substantial   earnings   and   profits   before   the   required earnings   and   profits   timing   adjustments.  A more   serious   impediment   is the possibility   of   a downward   adjustment  in the   basis   of the   corporate   shareholder’s   stock   as   a result   of the   pre-sale  dividend.   If TSN   had   been   required   to reduce   the   basis   in its CLIC   stock   by  the   amount   of the   dividends   received   deduction   that   it was   allowed   on   the  distribution,   the   transaction   would   have   lost   its   allure.   A   basis   reduction  would   have   placed   TSN   in the position   of trading   a dollar   of dividend   income for   a   dollar   of   gain   on   the   subsequent   sale   of   its   CLIC   stock.   Since corporations   do   not   enjoy   a   capital   gains   preference,   they   usually   are  indifferent   to   the   distinction   between   ordinary   income   and   capital   gain.1!5 Does   current   law   cause   TSN   to suffer   a basis   reduction   as a result   of the pre-  sale   dividend?   The   answer   is no   unless   the   distribution   is subject   to Section 1059.   That   section   requires   a   basis   reduction   for   the   amount   of   any “extraordinary   dividend”   which   was   not   taxed   to   a   corporate   shareholder  because   of the   dividends   received   deduction   where   the   stock   has   not   been  held   for   more   than   two   years   before   the   announcement   of the   dividend.126  Because   of its size   (roughly   $1.67   million,   according   to the facts   of the   case),  the dividend   to TSN   appears   to be “extraordinary”   under   the tests   in Section 1059(c).   But   TSN   nonetheless   could   have   avoided   any   basis   reduction   if it had   held   its   CLIC   stock   for   more   than   two   years   before   the   dividend   was  announced. One final obstacle must be mentioned in the interests   of full disclosure.  If TSN and CLIC were affiliated corporations   and elected to file a  consolidated tax   return,!27 TSN would   have   been   required to reduce its basis in the CLIC stock as   a result   of  the   dividend. The consolidated   return  regulations, which treat   an “affiliated group” as a single taxpaying entity,  logically eliminate   intracorporate   dividends   from the consolidated group’s joint  gross   income.!28 The dividend is considered a mere reshuffling of profits within a single taxpayer   which should not generate   additional   income. The regulations also provide that a parent’s   basis   in the   stock   of a subsidiary is  generally   reduced   by the full amount of any   excluded intercompany  124 See   Section   F5 of  this chapter,   supra. 125 Other tax   attributes, however,   might cause TSN to prefer   one or the   other   type   of  income.   For  example, if TSN had   unused capital   losses, it might prefer capital   gains on   the  sale to  fully taxable   dividend   income.  126 T.R.C. § 1059(a).   See   Section   F3 of  this   chapter,   supra.  1227,   See   Chapter   13, supra. 128   Reg.   § 1.1502—13(f)(2) (ii).  197

198  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  dividend.29 It follows that   the strategy employed in TSN Liquidating has no  appeal in the context of a consolidated group.  Despite   these   technical   hurdles,   a pre-sale   dividend   is still viable   if the selling   parent   corporation   has   held   the   stock   of a   subsidiary   for   more   than  two   years   and   the   corporations   do   not   file   a   consolidated   return.   The   Tax  Court’s   decision   in Litton   Industries,   Inc.   v.   Commissioner!   illustrates   the  importance   of form   and   timing   to the   success   of this   technique.   The   issue   in Litton   was   whether   a $30   million   dividend,   paid to Litton   by a wholly   owned subsidiary   in the   form   of a negotiable   promissory   note   five   months   prior   to Litton’s   sale   of the   subsidiary’s   stock   to   Nestle   Corporation,   was   truly   a dividend   rather   than   part   of the   proceeds   received   by Litton   on   the   sale   of the stock.   The   promissory   note   was   later satisfied   by Nestle   at the same   time  that   it purchased   the   stock.   Dividend   treatment   was   preferable   to   Litton  because   of the   shelter   provided   by what   was   then   an   85   percent   dividends received   deduction. Distinguishing   Waterman   Steamship   Corp.   v.   Commissioner!3! (discussed   in TSN   Liquidating   at pages   193-195   of the text,   supra),   the   Tax Court   held   that   the payment   was   a dividend.   Favorable   (and   distinguishing) factors   were:   (1) unlike   Waterman   Steamship,   the   dividend   and   subsequent  sale   in   Litton   were   substantially   separated   in   time   (over   five   months   in Litton   was   better   than   the   few   hours   in   Waterman);   (2)   at   the   time   the  dividend   was   declared,   no   formal   action   had   been   taken   by   the   parent   to initiate   a sale to Nestle   and   “[t]here   was   no   definite   purchaser   waiting   in the wings   with   the terms   and   conditions   of sale   already   agreed   upon;”!82   and   (3) as   in   TSN   Liquidating,   the   overall   transaction   was   not   a   sham   because   a business   purpose   was   served   by   the   dividend.   In   rejecting   the   Service’s  contention   that the dividend   and   subsequent   sale of the subsidiary   should   be  treated   as   one   transaction   for tax   purposes,   the   court   reasoned:133 The term   “dividend” is defined in section   316(a) as   a  distribution by a corporation to its shareholders out  of earnings   and profits. The parties have stipulated that   Stouffer had   earnings   and  profits exceeding   $30 million at the time the dividend   was declared.  This Court   has   recognized that a dividend may be paid by a note.  T.R. Miller   Mill   Co. v. Commissioner, 37   B.T.A. 48, 49 (1938), affd. 102   F.2d   599 (5th  Cir.1939). Based on these criteria, the $30 million distribution by Stouffer would clearly constitute a dividend if the sale   of Stouffer had not occurred. We are not persuaded that   the subsequent sale   of Stouffer to Nestle changes that   result merely because it was   more   advantageous to Litton from a tax perspective. It is well established that a taxpayer is entitled to structure his   affairs and   transactions in order to minimize his   taxes. This proposition   does   not   give a taxpayer carte blanche to   set up a  129 Reg. §'1.1502-32(b)(2), (3)(v). 130 89  T.C.  1086 (1987). 181 430 F.2d 1185  (5th  Cir.1970), 182 89 T.C,  at  1099. 133   Td. at 1099-1100,

CHAPTER 4 NONLIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS 199  transaction   in   any   form   which   will   avoid   tax   consequences,  regardless   of whether   the   transaction   has   substance.   Gregory   v. Helvering,   293   U.S.   465   (1985).   A   variety   of factors   present   here  preclude   a   finding   of sham   or   subterfuge.   Although   the   record   in  this   case   clearly   shows   that   Litton   intended   at   the   time   the  dividend   was   declared   to   sell   Stouffer,   no   formal   action   had   been  taken   and   no   announcement   had   been   made.   There   was   no   definite  purchaser   waiting   in the   wings   with   the   terms   and   conditions   of sale already   agreed   upon.   At that time,   Litton   had   not even   decided upon   the   form   of   sale   of   Stouffer.   Nothing   in   the   record   here  suggests   that   there   was   any   prearranged   sale agreement,   formal   or  informal,   at the   time   the   dividend   was   declared.   .  Petitioner   further   supports   its argument   that   the   transaction was   not   a   sham   by   pointing   out   Litton’s   legitimate   business  purposes   in declaring   the dividend.   Although   the code   and   case   law  do   not   require   a dividend   to have   a business   purpose,   it is a factor to   be   considered   in   determining   whether   the   overall   transaction was   a   sham.   T.S.N.   Liquidating   Corp.   v.   United   States,   624   F.2d  1328   (5th Cir.1980).   Petitioner   argues   that the distribution   allowed Litton   to maximize   the   gross   after-tax   amount   it could   receive   from  its   investment   in   Stouffer.   From   the   viewpoint   of   a   private purchaser   of Stouffer,   it is difficult   to see   how   the   declaration   of a  dividend   would   improve   the   value   of the   stock   since   creating   a  liability   in   the   form   of a   promissory   note   for   $30   million   would reduce   the   value   of   Stouffer   by   approximately   that   amount. However,   since   Litton   was   considering   disposing   of all or   part   of Stouffer   through   a   public   or   private   offering,   the   payment   of a  dividend   by a promissory   note   prior to any   sale had two   advantages.  First,   Litton   hoped   to   avoid   materially   diminishing   the   market  value   of   the   Stouffer   stock.   At   that   time,   one   of   the   factors  considered   in valuing   a stock,   and   in determining   the   market   value  of a stock   was   the   “multiple   of earnings”   criterion.   Payment   of the  dividend   by issuance   of a promissory   note   would   not   substantially  alter   Stouffer’s   earnings.   Since   many   investors   were   relatively  unsophisticated,   Litton   may   have   been   quite   right   that   it could  increase   its investment   in Stouffer   by at least   some   portion   of the $30   million   dividend.   Second,   by declaring   a dividend   and   paying   it  by a promissory   note   prior to an   anticipated   public   offering,   Litton could   avoid   sharing   the   earnings   with   future   additional shareholders   while   not diminishing   to the full extent   of the pro rata  dividend,   the   amount   received   for the   stock.   Whether   Litton   could  have   come   out   ahead   after   Stouffer   paid   the   promissory   note   is at  this   point   merely   speculation   about   a public   offering   which   never occurred.   The   point,   however,   is that   Litton   hoped   to achieve   some business   purpose,   and   not   just   tax   benefits,   in   structuring   the transaction   as it did.  Under   these   facts, where   the   dividend   was   declared   6  months prior   to  the   sale   of Stouffer,   where   the   sale   was   not   prearranged,

--- Page 270 ---

200  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  and since Stouffer had earnings and profits exceeding $30 million  at the time the dividend   was declared, we   cannot   conclude that   the  distribution was merely a device designed to give   the appearance  of a dividend to a part of the sales proceeds. In this   case, the form  and   substance of the transaction coincide; it was not a transaction  entered into solely for tax reasons, and it should be recognized as  structured by petitioner.  PROBLEM  Strap   Corporation   is the   sole   shareholder   of X, Inc.   Strap   and   X do not  file a consolidated   return,   and   Strap   has   held   its X stock   for more   than   two  years.   Strap   has   a $150,000   basis in its X stock.   Boot   is a prospective   buyer  and   is willing   to   purchase   all   of the   X   stock,   but   he   is unable   to   pay   the $500,000   price   demanded   by Strap   even   though   he   believes   it to be   fair.   X  has $100,000   cash on hand   and   an   ample   supply   of earnings   and   profits.   To solve   these   problems,   the   parties   have   agreed   on   the   following   plan:   Strap  Corporation   will   cause   X,   Inc.   to   distribute   $100,000   _to it-as   a   dividend.  Promptly   thereafter,   Strap   will   sell   its X   stock   to   Boot   for   $400,000.   What are   the   tax   consequences   of this   plan?   What   if Strap   were   an n individual  rather   than   a corporation?  |   ( (svle $058 stuk)   eae   Me  ar   book.  [XT   (ork cosh >  E68 Ga.

CHAPTER   5  REDEMPTIONS   AND   PARTIAL  LIQUIDATIONS  A.   INTRODUCTION  Code:   §§ 302;   317(b).  The   Logic   of Section   302.   Shareholders   generally   recognize   a capital gain or loss on   the   sale   of all or part   of their   stock.   Assume,   for example, that   A   purchased   100   shares   of X   Corporation   stock   two   years   ago   for  $1,000.   IfA sells   50 of those   shares   to B, an   unrelated   outsider,   for $750,  he   will recognize   a $250   long-term   capital   gain.   But   what   if   A made   the  same   sale   to   the   corporation?   Should   that   transaction,   known   as   a  redemption,   also   generate   a $250   long-term   capital   gain?   We   need   more  facts   to   answer   the   question.   If A   is one   of several   X   shareholders   and  owns   a small   percentage   of the   corporation’s   stock,   a sale   of stock   to the corporation   may   be similar   (for tax   purposes)   to a sale   to B. But   if X has  few   shareholders   and   ample   earnings   and   profits   and   A   is   a   major shareholder,   the   transaction   begins   to resemble   a dividend.  To   illustrate,   assume   that   A’s   100   shares   constitute   all   of   X  Corporation’s   outstanding   stock.   In that   event,   A’s “sale”   of 50   shares   to  the   corporation   in   exchange   for   $750   cash   is indistinguishable   from   a  nonliquidating   distribution   of $750.   Although   A has   surrendered   a stock  certificate   for   50   shares,   his   proportionate   interest   in   the   corporation  remains   unchanged.   When   the   smoke   clears,   A   continues   to control   all corporate   decisions   and   he remains   the   sole   shareholder,   entitled   to   100 percent   of X’s   net   assets   upon   a   liquidation.   Yet   without   altering   his  interest   in the business,   A has   extracted   $750   from   the corporate   coffers.  This   is the   essence   of a dividend!   But   if the “sale”   to X were   respected,   A  would   be   permitted   to   use   a   proportionate   amount   of his   stock   basis  ($500)   to offset   an   equivalent   amount   of income,   and   any   resulting   gain  will be taxed   at capital   gains   rates.   If   A were   permitted   to avoid   dividend  characterization   with   such   ease,   proportionate   redemption   programs   by shareholders   of   closely   held   corporations   quickly   would   become   a  national   sport whenever   dividends   are   taxed   at higher   rates   than   capital  gains   or shareholders   have   a substantial   basis   in their   stock.  These   simple   examples identify   the fundamental   problem in determining the shareholder level   tax consequences of a redemption. A  ates  cash or other   property   while   leaving   their proportionate   interest   intact—  and redemptions   that   resemble sales   because they result   in  a meaningful  reduction in   the   shareholder’   ionate   interest.   In the   now   distant  201

C knege=   Sale  ae  202  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  past, the Code had only   one vague standard to resolve this question. A  redemption was treated as an operating distribution and taxed as a  dividend to the extent of the corporation’s current and accumulated earnings   and profits unless it was not “essentially equivalent to a taxable dividend.”! Cases   were resolved by looking to all the facts and circumstances, including the corporation’s “business purpose”   and the  “net effect” of the transaction.  The   enactment   of Section   302   introduced   a commendable   degree   of  certainty   in   an   area   where   predictions   had   been   precarious.   Section  302(a)   provides   that   a redemption   will   be   treated   as   an   “exchange”   if it  satisfies one of   five statutory tests in Section 302(b). “Exchange” status  moans thatdha alerobolder ssaurally allTosopnite capital eonOF Toes  t hponien Eata CREE EaREGER ts ae   ee  :   is   in   the   redeemed   stock.   A   redemption   falling outside of Section   302(b)   is treated   under   Section   302(d)   as a “distribution to/which   Section   301   applies.”   Under   the   rules   studied   in the   preceding  chapter,   the   distribution   will   be   a   dividend   to   the   extent   of   the  -corporation’s current and accumulated earnings   and profits, then a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder’s basis in the redeemed  stock, and finally gain from the sale or exchange of the  stock to the extent  of any balance. ;  Section   302(b) is thus the nerve   center for determining the  shareholder-level tax consequences of a redemption and the principal  focus of this chapter. Three of the five statutory tests (Sections 302(b)(1)—  (3)) examine   whether there has been a sufficient reduction in the  shareholder’s ownership interest in the corporation to justify treating the  redemption as an exchange.   To obtain a more accurate measure, the shareholder’s interest   before and after the redemption is determined after application of the constructive Tp rules   318.8 Section   302(b)(4) shifts the   focus to the corporate level and   provides  exchange   treatment for any distribution   that   qualifies as   a “partial  liquidation” under Section   302(e) because it involves a genuine contraction of the distributing   corporation’s   business. Finally, Section  302(b)(5) provides that redemptions   by a mutual fund or real   estate  investment trust generally will be  treated as an exchange.  Basis Consequences. If a redemption is treated as   a  sale, the basis of  the redeemed ] into account in determining the der’s gain or   loss.   If  a redemption is treate as   a   Section 301 distribution, it  is a dividend to the   extent of  the   corporation’s earnings  1 Internal Revenue   Code of 1939, § 115(g).  2  See. Bittker.& Eustice, Federal Income   Taxation of Corporations   and   Shareholders  { 9.01. Another line  of authority   treated a redemption as not  “essentially   equivalent to  a taxable  dividend” if it involved a contraction in  the   corporation’s   business activities. This test focused  on events at the   corporate   rather   than   the shareholder level and   gave   birth to the   tax   concept  known as   a “partial   liquidation.” The   remnants of  this concept are considered in  Section D of  this  chapter, infra.  8   LR.C.   § 302()(1).

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  a eae ai fet Ahesoalerer  ee teeny The conceptual difficulty is that an actual corporate distribution generally is made pro   rata with respect to all  shares in a class   of stock. In   contrast, in a redemption the corporation  may buy back only specific shares of stock. Thus,   questions may arise  about stock   basis when some but not all shares are redeemed and the  redemption is treated as a Section   301 distribution. Those questions are:  (1) how is basis recovered, and (2) what   happens to the  basis of redeemed stock? The regulations historically have not provided a great deal of guidance except for reassuring   shareholders that their remaining basis in the redeemed stock does not disappear but may be added to the  basis  of the shareholder’s   retained stock.5  In   2009,   the   Service   issued   proposed   regulations   that   applied  broadly   to distributions   throughout   Subchapter   C and would   have   helped clarify   these   questions.   Those   regulations   applied   to   the   portion   of the  distribution   that   is not   a dividend   (i.e., the   amount   in excess   of corporate earnings   and   profits)   and   adopted   the   view   that   a   distribution   in  redemption,   like   a regular   distribution   where   no   stock   is surrendered,   is  attributable   to all of the   shareholder’s   stock   in the   class   of shares   being  redeemed.   Thus,   the   portion   of the   distribution   that   is not   a   dividend  would   be   applied   to reduce   the   adjusted   basis   of each   share   held   by the  redeemed   shareholder.   This   reduction   would   be pro   rata,   share-by-share to   all shares   in the   class   of stock   to be   redeemed,   not   just   to the   shares actually   surrendered   in the   redemption.®   Under   this   approach,   amounts  distributed   in excess   of the basis   of particular   shares   result   in gain under  Section   301(c)(3).   Eventually,   the   proposed   regulations   were   withdrawn  because   the   Treasury   determined   that   they   could   not   be   implemented comprehensively   without   significant   modifications.   The   Treasury   will continue   to study   the   issue,   but   it indicated   that   the   results   of a Section  301   distribution   should   derive   from   the   consideration   received   by   a shareholder   in   respect   of   each   share   of   stock,   notwithstanding  designations   otherwise.7   Related   stock   basis   issues   are   discussed   as they arise   in the   relevant   redemption   fact patterns.  Tax   Consequences to Distributing   Corporation. Whether a  redemption is treated as an exchange or  a Section   301 distribtition at the  shareholder level, the tax consequenc rstriputi Orpor   f  Stribution of property in a redemption are governed by ection   311. a   di  e   distributing   C   recognizes   gain   on   a   distribution   of  4°   LR.C.   § 301(c).  5 See   Reg. § 1.302—2(c), providing for “proper adjustment of  the remaining stock.” 6 Prop.   Reg. § 1.302—5(a)(1).   This is preferable to limiting   basis   recovery to the   shares actually surrendered in  the redemption.  7 REG—143686—07 (March 28,   2019). The   Treasury also indicated   that it  will   focus   on redemptions   treated as Section   301   distributions   that   result   in inappropriate shifts   in stock basis. These   transactions   include   redemptions of  stock   that   shift  basis   from a taxpayer   who is not   subject  to  tax   or who is  tax indifferent   to another   taxpayer   who is related   under   Section   318  to  permit   the related   taxpayer   to  recognize   a loss.   See   I.R.S.   Notice   2001—45,   2001-2   C.B.   129.  203

204  <<  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  operty,   but   it may   not   recognize   loss   on   a   distribution   of  property   that   has   declined   in value.8  Changing   Stakes.   The   tax   stakes   on   a   redemption   have   changed considerably   over   the   years.   They   are   influenced   by   several   variables,  such   as   the   type   of   shareholder   (individual   or   corporate),   the shareholder’s   basis   in the   redeemed   stock,   and   the   applicable   tax   rates for dividends   and   capital   gains.   For   most   of our   tax history,   noncorporate  shareholders   preferred   a   redemption   to   be   treated   as   a   sale   of   stock resulting   in recovery   of the   shareholder’s   basis   and   recognition   of more  lightly   taxed   capital   gain.   Corporate   shareholders   prefer   dividend  treatment   because   they   can   shelter   most   of   the   distribution   if they qualify   for   the   dividends   received   deduction   or   completely   exclude dividends   received   from   other   members   of   an   affiliated   group   of  corporations   that   file a consolidated   tax   return.  The   introduction   of reduced   tax   rates   on   qualified   dividends   altered  the   stakes   for individual   shareholders.   As   long as   the   dividend   and   long-  term   capital   gains   tax   rates   remain   the   same,   the   major   advantage   to  treating   a   redemption   as   an   exchange   is   the   shareholder’s   ability   to recover   the   basis   of the   redeemed   stock   in   determining   gain   or   loss.   In some   cases,   this   still provides   an   incentive   to qualify   a redemption   as   an  exchange,   but   not   as   much   as   when   exchange   treatment   offered   both recovery   of basis   and   a   significant   capital   gains   rate   preference   (as  compared   to   dividends)   and   hardly   at   all   where   a   noncorporate  shareholder’s   stock   basis   is nominal.   In special   situations,   such   as   where  a shareholder   has   excess   capital   losses   that   will   offset   capital   gains   but  not   qualified   dividends,   on   a   deferred   payment   redemption   where  installment   sale   reporting   under   Section   453   would   benefit   the shareholder,   or for foreign   shareholders   who   may   incur   a withholding   tax on   U.S.   dividends   but   not   on   capital   gains,   exchange   treatment   also   will be preferable. The Nontax Context. Redemptions are used to accomplish a variety of corporate and   shareholder   planning objectives.   In   the   case   of  closely  held  corporations, a redemption may be  the vehicle for a shift of corporate  control, the buyout of a dissatisfied or deceased   shareholder, or  to provide  a liquidity opportunity for those shareholders who desire to diversify their holdings. Stock redemptions   by publicly traded companies also have become popular   transactions for corporations   with   excess   cash,   especially  when the company believes   the market has undervalued its shares  relative to their   intrinsic value   and no better investment   opportunities are   available. Keep these   contexts in mind in studying the somewhat mechanical aspects of Section   302 at the beginning of this chapter.   Later sections   explore   some of  the planning   opportunities   provided   by Section 302,  8 IRC.   § 311(a), (b). For   the   details and   the   effect   of  a redemption on   the   distributing  corporation’s   earnings   and profits,   see   Section   E of this   chapter,   infra.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  B.   CONSTRUCTIVE   OWNERSHIP   OF   STOCK  Code:   §§ 302(c)(1);   318.  Regulations:   §§ 1.318—1(a),   (b), —2, —3(a),   (b), —4.  Any   system   that   purports   to measure   the   change   in a shareholder’s proportionate   interest   in a corporation   would   be ineffective   if it failed   to consider   the   holdings   of closely   related   shareholders.   Returning   to our introductory   example,   assume   that   A   and   his   daughter,   D, each   own   50 of the   100   outstanding   shares   of X   Corporation   and   A   sells   30   of his  shares   to the corporation   for $450.   A’s actual   percentage   ownership   drops from   50 percent   (50 out   of 100   shares)   to 29 percent   (20 out   of 70 shares).  Has   he substantially   reduced   his proportionate   interest?   Looking   only to  A’s   actual   ownership,   the   reduction   is   substantial,   but   the   remaining shares   are   owned   by a   close   relative.   With   appropriate   skepticism,   the drafters   of the   Code   concluded   that   in determining   stock   ownership   for purposes   of   the   Section   302(b)   tests   for   exchange   treatment,   an  individual   taxpayer   or entity should be considered   as owning   stock owned by   certain   family   members   and   related   entities   under   elaborate attribution   rules   set forth   in Section   318.9  Section   318   is one   of several   sets   of constructive   ownership   rules   in the   Internal   Revenue   Code!®   and   applies   only when   it is expressly   made  applicable   by another   provision   of the   Code.!!   Its principal   role   is in the redemption   area,   where   it treats   a   taxpayer   as   “owning”   stock   that   is actually   owned   by   various   related   parties.   The   attribution   rules   in Section   318   fall into   the   following   four   categories.  1.   Family   Attribution.   An   individual   is considered   as owning   stock  owned   by his   spouse,   children,   grandchildren   and   parents.   Siblings   and in-laws   are   not   part   of the   “family”   for   this   purpose,   and   there   is no attribution   from   a grandparent   to a grandchild.!? 2. Entity to Beneficiary Attribution.   Stock owned by or for a partnership or estate is considered as owned by the partners or beneficiaries in proportion to their beneficial   interests.8 A person ceases to be a “beneficiary” of  an   estate for  this purpose when she   receives all property to which she is entitled (e.g., a specific bequest)   and the possibility  that  she must return the property to satisfy claims is remote. 14 Stock owned   by a trust   (other than a qualified employees’ trust) is considered as owned   by the  beneficiaries in proportion to their actuarial interests in  the trust. In the   case   of grantor trusts,   stock is considered  owned   by the grantor or other   person who is taxable on   the   trust  9   TR.C.   § 302(c)(1).  10   Other   constructive   ownership   provisions   include   Sections   267(c),   341(e)(8),   and   544. 11   Section   318(b)   contains   a partial   list   of cross   references   to   sections   applying   Section  2 TRC.   § 318(a)(1).   Cf.  L.R.C. § 318(a)(5)(B). 13 T.R.C. § 318(a)(2)(A). 44 Reg.   §  1.318—3(a).  205

Stock   owned   by   partners   or  beneficiaries   of an   estate   is considered   as   owned   by the   partnership   or estate.17   All   stock   owned   by a trust   beneficiary   is attributed   to the   trust  except   where   the   beneficiary’s   interest   is   “remote”   and   “contingent.”  Grantor   trusts   are   considered   to own   stock   owned   by the grantor   or other  person   taxable   on   the   income   of the   trust.18   All the   stock   owned   by a 50  percent   or   more   shareholder   of   a   corporation   is   attributed   to   the corporation.19  4.   Option   Attribution.   A person   holding   an   option   to acquire   stock is considered   as   owning   that   stock.2°  These   general   rules   are   supplemented   by a   set   of “operating   rules”  in   Section   318(a)(5),   which   generally   authorize   chain   attribution   (e.g., parent   to child   to child’s   trust)   except   that   there   can   be no   double   family attribution   (e.g., no   attribution   from   parent   to child   to child’s   spouse)   or  “sidewise”   attribution   (e.g., stock   attributed   to an   entity   from   a partner, beneficiary   or   shareholder   may   not   be   reattributed   from   that   entity   to  another   partner,   beneficiary   or   shareholder).2!   In   addition,   option attribution   takes   precedence   over   family   attribution   where   both   apply.22  For   Section   318   purposes,   an   S corporation   is treated   as   a partnership,  and   8 corporation   shareholders   are   treated   like partners.23 The   problems below test your ability to apply the attribution rules in some typical   factual   contexts.  PROBLEMS  1. Wham Corporation has   100 shares of common stock outstanding.

Contingent   interests   are   considered   remote   if the   actuarial   value of the interest is 5  percent or less of  the value of the   trust property, assuming the   trustee  exercises maximum discretion in favor of the beneficiary.  19   I.R.C.   § 318(a)(8)(C).  20   LR.C.   § 318(a)(4).   “Options”   have   been   interpreted   to include   warrants   and   convertible debentures.

(c)   How   many   shares,   if any,   of Yancy   are   owned   by Partnership, B, C, D   and   Xerxes?  C.   REDEMPTIONS   TESTED   AT   THE   SHAREHOLDER   LEVEL  1.   SUBSTANTIALLY   DISPROPORTIONATE   REDEMPTIONS  Code:   § 302(b)(2). Regulations:   § 1.302-3.  The   virtue   of   Section   302(b)(2)   is its   certainty.   If a   shareholder’s reduction   in   voting   stock   as   a   result   of   a   redemption   satisfies   three  mechanical   requirements,   the redemption   will be treated   as an   exchange. To qualify   as “substantially   disproportionate,”   a redemption   must   satisfy the   following   requirements:  (1) Immediately after the redemption, the shareholder   must  own (actually and constructively) less than 50 percent of  the total combined voting power of all classes of stock   entitled to vote,24  (2) The   percentage of  total outstanding voting stock owned   by the shareholder   immediately after the redemption   must be less than 80 percent of the percentage of  total voting stock owned by the shareholder   immediately before   the  redemption,”®   and (3) The   shareholder’s   percentage   ownership of common stock  (whether   voting or nonvoting) after   the redemption also  24   -T.R.C.   § 302(b)(2)(B).  2   .R.C.   § 302(b)(2)(C).   This   requirement   may   be expressed   by the following   formula: Voting shares   owned   before  Voting  shares owned after  redemption   must   be   80 x redemption  Total   voting   shares   outstanding _ less  than:   Total voting shares   outstanding after  redemption   before  redemption  207

208 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  must   be less   than   80   percent   of the   percentage   of common  stock   owned   before   the   redemption.”6   If there   is more   than  one   class   of common   stock,   the   80 percent   test is applied   by  reference   to fair market   value.?7  The   attribution   rules   of Section   318   are   applicable   in   measuring   stock ownership   for purposes   of all these   percentage   tests. To   illustrate,   assume   Redeemer   owns   60   percent   of the   common  stock   of a corporation   which   has   only   one   class   of stock   outstanding.   A  redemption   which   reduces   Redeemer’s   stock   interest   to   a   percentage below   48   percent   would   satisfy   Section   302(b)(2).   Below   that   level, Redeemer   would   own   less   than   50   percent   of   the   corporation’s   total  combined   voting   power,   and   his   percentage   of voting   stock   after   the redemption   (below   48   percent)   would   be   less   than   80   percent   of   his  percentage   of voting   stock   before   the   redemption   (60 percent). The   regulations   elaborate   on   the   operation   of   Section   302(b)(2). (   Stock   with   voting   rights   only upon   the happening   of a specific   event   (e.g.,  a default in a payment of dividends on preferred stock) is not considered | voting stock until the event occurs.28 A redemption of  solely nonvoting  | stock will never satisfy Section 302(b)(2) because there will not be a  sufficient reduction in the shareholder’s interest in voting stock. But if a | redemption qualifies as substantially disproportionate under Section 302(b)(2), a simultaneous   redemption of nonvoting preferred stock (which | is not Section   306 stock)?9 will be  treated as an exchange.39 The Service | also has ruled   that a redemption of voting   preferred stock from a  \ shareholder owning no common stock   (either   directly or by way of attribution) may qualify under Section 302(b)(2), even though the shareholder   cannot satisfy the 80 percent test relating to common stock.31  The substantially disproportionate redemption safe harbor does not  apply to any redemption made pursuant to  a plan which has the purpose  or effect of a series   of redemptions that, taken together,   result   in a  distribution   that is not substantially   disproportionate   with   respect to the  shareholder.®2   This   statutory   application of the   step transaction   doctrine  is the   subject of the  ruling   that follows.  26 L.R.C. § 802(b)(2)(C).  27 The common stock cutback test is applied on   an aggregate rather   than a class-by-class  basis. Thus, if  a shareholder’s   aggregate   reduction in all classes of common stock (measured   by  value) meets the percentage tests   in Section   302(b)(2)(C),   the redemption will be   treated as an  exchange even if the shareholder   continues to own 100   percent of  one class   of outstanding  common stock.

FACTS  X, a corporation   founded   by A, is engaged   in an   ongoing   business.   As  of   January   1, 1983,   X’s   sole class   of stock,   voting   common   stock,   was   held by A, B, C, and   D, who   are   unrelated   to each   other.   A owned   1,466   shares, B   owned   210   shares,   C owned   200   shares,   and   D   owned   155   shares   ofX  stock.   A was   president   and   B was   vice-president   of X. X   has   a   repurchase   agreement   with   all X   shareholders,   except   A.  This   agreement   provides   that   if any   such   shareholder   ceases   to   be  actively   connected   with   the   business   operations   of X,   such   shareholder must   promptly   tender   to   X the   then-held   X   shares   for an   amount   equal to the   book   value   of such   stock.   X has   a reciprocal   obligation   to purchase  such   shares   at book   value   within   6 months   of such   shareholder’s   ceasing to be actively   connected   with   X’s business   operations.  On   January   1, 1983,   B   informed   A   of B’s   intention   to resign   as   of  March   22,   1983.   Based   on   this   information,   A caused   X to adopt   a plan   of  redemption   and   to redeem   902   shares   of A’s X stock,   on   March   15,   1983,  for   which   A   received   700x   dollars.   Thus,   A   then   held   564   shares   of the  1129   shares   (49.96   percent)   of the X stock   still outstanding,   temporarily  yielding   majority   control   over   the   affairs   of X   until   B   ceased   to   be   a  shareholder.   On   March   22,   1983,   B   resigned   from   X   and,   in accordance  with   the   X   stock   purchase   agreement,   X   redeemed   for   cash   all   of B’s  shares   within   the   next   6   months,   thus   leaving   919   shares   of   X   stock  outstanding,   restoring   majority   control   to A.  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Section   302(a) of the Code provides that if  a corporation redeems its stock and if one   of  the paragraphs of subsection (b) applies, then   such redemption will be   treated as   a distribution in part or   full payment in exchange for the stock.  Section   302(b)(2)   of  the Code   provides   that a redemption will be  treated as an exchange   pursuant to section   302(a) if the redemption is ~ substantially   disproportionate   with   respect to the shareholder,   but   that this paragraph will   not apply   unless immediately after   the redemption the   shareholder   owns less than   50   percent of  the   total combined voting power of all classes   of  stock   entitled to vote.  Under section   302(b)(2)(C)   of the   Code,   one   of the   requirements for  the   distribution   to  be substantially   disproportionate is  that the  ratio  that the voting   stock of the corporation   owned   by  the  shareholder   immediately

210  ea  TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  after   the   redemption   bears   to   all the   voting   stock   of the   corporation   at such   time,   is less than   80 percent   of the ratio   that   the voting   stock   of the corporation   owned   by   the   shareholder   immediately   before   the redemption   bears   to all the voting   stock   of the   corporation   at such   time. Section   302(b)(2)(D)   of   the   Code,   in   dealing   with   a   series   of  redemptions,   provides   that   section   302(b)(2)   is   not   applicable   to   any  redemption   made   pursuant   to a plan   the   purpose   or   effect   of which   is a  series   of redemptions   resulting   in a distribution   which   (in the aggregate)  is not   substantially   disproportionate   with   respect   to the   shareholder.  The   percentage   provisions   contained   in   sections   302(b)(2)(B)   and 302(b)(2)(C)   of   the   Code   provide   “safe   harbor’   exchange   treatment.  Examined   separately,   the   transaction   that   occurred   on   March   15,   1983,  would   qualify   as   a substantially   disproportionate   redemption   because   (i)  A’s   ownership   of X’s   voting   stock   immediately   after   the   redemption   was  less than   50 percent   of the total combined   voting   power   of all the   X stock  and   (11) A’s ownership   of X’s voting   stock   was   reduced   from   72.18   percent  to   49.96   percent,   which   meets   the   80   percent   requirement   of   section  302(b)(2)(C).   However,   if A’s   redemption   is considered   to   be   part   of a  section   302(b)(2)(D)   series   of redemptions   which   included   X’s redemption  of B’s   shares,   then   A’s   redemption   would   not   constitute   a   substantially  disproportionate   redemption   because   (i) A’s ownership   of X’s voting   stock  after   the   redemptions   exceeded   50   percent   of the   total   combined   voting power   of X and   (i1) A’s ownership   of X’s voting   stock   after the redemptions  was   reduced   from   72.18   percent   to   61.37   percent,   which   does   not   meet the   80 percent   requirement   of section   302(b)(2)(C).  Section   1.302-3(a) of the Income Tax   Regulations states that  whether or not a plan   described in section 302(b)(2)(D) of the Code exists  will be determined from all the facts and   circumstances.  In   the present situation, although A and B had no   joint plan,  arrangement, or agreement for a series   of redemptions, the redemption of  A’s shares   was causally   related to the redemption of  B’s shares in that  A saw an apparent   opportunity to secure exchange   treatment   under  section   302(b)(2) of the Code   by   temporarily yielding majority control over   the affairs   of  X.  Nothing in section   302(b)(2)(D) of the Code or in the   legislative  history of  this section *  * * indicates   that   the   existence of a plan depends upon an agreement   between two or more   shareholders.   Thus, a “plan” for  purposes of section   302(b)(2)(D)   need   be nothing   more'than a design bya single redeemed   shareholder to arrange a redemption as part   of a sequence of events   that ultimately   restores to such   shareholder the control   that was   apparently   reduced in  the redemption. Under the   facts and   circumstances here,   section   302(b)(2)(D)   of  the  Code   requires   that   the redemptions of A   and   B be   considered in   the  aggregate.   Accordingly,   A’s redemption   meets   neither   the   50   percent limitation   of   section   302(b)(2)(B)   nor   the   80   percent   test   of   section

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS   211  302(b)(2)(C). Thus, the redemption of A’s shares was not substantially  disproportionate within the meaning of section 302(b)(2).  HOLDING  Under   the   facts   of this   ruling,   qualification   under   section   302(b)(2)  of the   Code   of A’s redemption   should   not   be measured   immediately   after  that   redemption,   but,   instead,   should   be   measured   after   B’s   redemption  that   followed   soon   after A’s redemption.  PROBLEMS 1.   Y   Corporation   has   100   shares   of   common   stock   and   200   shares   of  nonvoting   preferred   stock   outstanding.   Alice   owns   80   shares   of   Y common stock   and   100   shares   of its preferred   stock.   Cathy   owns   the   remaining   20  shares   of   Y common   and   100   shares   of Y preferred   stock. Alice   and   Cathy   are  not   related.   In   each   of   the   following   alternative   situations,   determine whether   the redemption   satisfies   the requirements   of § 302(b)(2):  (a)   On   January   15, Y Corporation   redeems   75   of Alice’s   preferred shares. (b)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that   Y   also   redeems   60   shares   of Alice’s   common   stock. (c)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that   Y   also   redeems   70   shares   of Alice’s   common   stock.  of the   same   year,   Y   redeems   10   shares   of Cathy’s   common  stock?  2. Z  Corporation has 100 shares of voting common stock and 200   shares of nonvoting common stock outstanding. Every share of   Z common stock has a  fair market value of $100. Don owns 60 shares of Z voting common stock and 100   shares of Z  nonvoting common stock. Jerry owns all of the remaining Z  stock. Don and Jerry are not related to one another. If Z redeems 30 of Don’s voting common shares, will the redemption qualify for exchange   treatment under   § 302(b)(2)?

WAIVER OF FAMILY   ATTRIBUTION  Code:   § 302(b)(3),   (c).  _ Regulations:   § 1.302—4.  The   theory of  the   substantially   disproportionate safe harbor is that  exchange rather   than   dividend   treatment is appropriate when a  distribution   in redemption   causes a significant   reduction in   the  shareholder’s   interest   in   the   corporation’s   voting   stock.   This   policy  applies   with   even   greater   force in  the case   of  a complete   termination   of  a shareholder’s   interest,   which   qualifies   for exchange   treatment   under  Prep |  re   Qs3 “me, i   ioe

212 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Section 302(b)(3). For shareholders of a closely held family corporation,  however, the attribution rules present a substantial roadblock to a  complete termination. Even if  all of the stock of a retiring shareholder is  redeemed, she will continue to be treated as a 100 percent owner if her children or other   related   parties hold the remaining shares. To   provide   relief   where   the   redeemed   shareholder   is willing   to   cut the   corporate   cord,   Section   302(c)(2)   eases   the   path   toward   a   complete  termination   by waiving   the family   attribution   rules   if certain   conditions are   met.   This   attribution   amnesty   is   a   useful   planning   tool   for  shareholders   of family   corporations,   permitting   a shareholder   to achieve a   complete   termination   even   though   the   remaining   shares   are   held   by  close   relatives.   The   waiver   applies,   however,   only   to family   attribution; the   entity   and   option   attribution   rules   remain   fully applicable.   i  Waiver   of   the   family   attribution   rules   is   available   only   if  immediately   after   the   distribution   the   redeemed   shareholder   retains   no  “interest”   in the   corporation   (other   than   as   a creditor).   The   ban   extends to mterests   as   an   officer,   director   or   employee.   Section   302(c)(2)(A)   also  includes   a “ten year   look forward”   rule, under   which   the shareholder   may not   retain   or   acquire   (other   than   by bequest   or   inheritance)   any   of the  forbidden   interests   in   the   corporation   “other   than   an   interest   as   a  creditor.”33   To   prevent   anticipatory   bailouts,   Section   302(c)(2)(B) provides   a “ten   year   look   back”   rule,   under   which   the   family   attribution rules   may   not be waived   if during   the ten years   preceding   the redemption  either:   (1) the   redeemed   shareholder   acquired   any   of the   redeemed   stock  from   a “Section   318”   relative   or (2) any   such   close   relative   acquired   stock  from   the   redeemed   shareholder.   Neither   of   these   exceptions   applies,  however,   if “tax   avoidance”   was   not   one   of the   principal   purposes   of the otherwise   tainted   transfer.  The materials that   follow   illustrate how the Service and the   courts  have   interpreted these intricate requirements. i  Lynch v.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  prohibited   interest   in the corporation   after   the redemption   and   therefore  the   transaction   should   be   characterized   as   a   dividend   distribution taxable   as ordinary   income.   We   agree   with the Commissioner   and reverse  the Tax   Court.  I  Taxpayers,   William   and   Mima   Lynch,   formed   the   W.M.   Lynch   Co.  on   April   1, 1960.   The   corporation   issued   all of its outstanding   stock   to William   Lynch   (taxpayer).   The   taxpayer   specialized   in   leasing   cast-in-  place   concrete   pipe   machines.   He   owned   the   machines   individually   but  leased   them   to the corporation   which   in turn   subleased   the equipment   to  independent   contractors.  On   December   17,   1975   the   taxpayer   sold   50   shares   of   the  corporation’s   stock   to   his   son,   Gilbert   Lynch   (Gilbert),   for   $17,170.  Gilbert   paid   for   the   stock   with   a   $16,000   check   given   to   him   by   the  taxpayer   and   $1,170   from   his   own   savings.   The   taxpayer   and   his   wife  also resigned   as   directors   and   officers   of the corporation   on   the same   day. On   December   31,   1975   the   corporation   redeemed   all 2300   shares   of the   taxpayer’s   stock.   In   exchange   for   his   stock,   the   taxpayer   received $17,900   of property   and   a promissory   note   for   $771,920.   Gilbert,   as   the  sole remaining   shareholder,   pledged   his   50 shares   as   a guarantee   for the  note.   In   the   event   that   the   corporation   defaulted   on   any   of the   note  payments,   the   taxpayer   would   have   the   right   to vote   or   sell Gilbert’s   50  shares.  In   the   years   immediately   preceding   the   redemption,   Gilbert   had assumed   greater   managerial   responsibility   in   the   corporation.   He wished,   however,   to retain   the   taxpayer’s   technical   expertise   with   cast-  in-place   concrete   pipe   machines.   On   the   date   of   the   redemption,   the  taxpayer   also   entered   into   a consulting   agreement   with   the   corporation.  The   consulting   agreement   provided   the   taxpayer   with   payments   of $500  per   month   for five years,   plus reimbursement   for business   related   travel, entertainment,   and   automobile   expenses.2   In   February   1977,   the  corporation   and   the   taxpayer   mutually   agreed   to   reduce   the   monthly payments   to   $250.   The   corporation   never   withheld   payroll   taxes   from payments   made   to the taxpayer.  After   the redemption, the taxpayer   shared his former office with Gilbert. The   taxpayer   came to the office daily for approximately one   year; thereafter his appearances   dwindled to about once or twice   per week. When the corporation moved to   a new building in 1979,   the taxpayer  _ received   a private   office.  In  addition to the  consulting   agreement, the taxpayer   had other ties to the   corporation. He   remained   covered   by the   corporation’s   group medical   insurance policy   until   1980. When his coverage   ended,   the  taxpayer   had   received   the   benefit   of  $4,487.54   in premiums paid  by the  2 The   corporation   leased or purchased a pickup   truck for  the   taxpayer's   use   in 1977. If someone at  the  corporation   needed   the truck,   the  taxpayer   would   make it available   to  him.  213

He was also covered by a medical reimbursement plan, created the day of the redemption, which provided a maximum annual payment of $1,000 per member. Payments to the taxpayer under the plan  totaled $96.05.  II We   must   decide   whether   the   redemption   of the   taxpayer’s   stock   in  this   case   is taxable   as   a dividend   distribution   under   26   U.S.C.   § 301   or  as   long-term   capital   gain   under   26   U.S.C.   § 302(a).   Section   302(a)  provides   that   a   corporate   distribution   of property   in   redemption   of   a  shareholder’s   stock   is treated   as   a sale   or   exchange   of such   stock   if the  redemption   falls within   one   of four categories   described   in section   302(b).  If the   redemption   falls   outside   of these   categories,   then   it is treated   as   a dividend   distribution   under   section   301   to the   extent   of the   corporation’s earnings   and   profits.4  Section   302(b)(3)   provides   that   a   shareholder   is entitled   to   sale   or  exchange   treatment   if the   corporation   redeems   all of the   shareholder’s stock.   In order   to determine   whether   there   is a complete   redemption   for  purposes   of   section   302(b)(8),   the   family   attribution   rules   of   section 318(a)   must   be   applied   unless   the   requirements   of section   302(c)(2)   are  satisfied.   Here,   if the family   attribution   rules   apply,   the   taxpayer   will be deemed   to own   constructively   the   50 shares   held   by Gilbert   (100%   of the  corporation’s   stock)   and   the   transaction   would   not   qualify   as   a complete redemption   within   the   meaning   of section   302(b)(3). Section 302(c)(2)(A) states   in relevant part: In   the case   of a distribution described in subsection (b)(8), [the family attribution rules in] section   318(a)(1) shall   not apply  if—  Gi) immediately after the   distribution   the   distributee  has no interest in the corporation   (including an   interest as  officer, director, or employee), other than an   interest as   a  ereditor: =.  The Commissioner argues that in every case   the performance of  post- redemption services is a prohibited interest under section 302(c)(2)(A)(i),  regardless of whether the taxpayer is an officer, director, employee, or independent contractor.  The   Tax   Court rejected   the Commissioner’s   argument, finding   that  the services rendered   by the taxpayer did   not amount to   a prohibited  interest in the   corporation.   In reaching this conclusion,   the Tax   Court relied   on a test derived   from   Lewis v. Commissioner, 47   T.C. 129. 136 (1966)   (Simpson, J., concurring):  Immediately after   the enactment of   the   1954   Code, it was  recognized   that   section   302(c)(2)(A)G)   did   not   prohibit office 4 On the date   of  the  redemption,   W.M.

CHAPTER   5  holding   per   se,   but   was   concerned   with   a   retained   financial  stake   in the corporation,   such   as   a profit-sharing   plan,   or in the creation   of an   ostensible   sale that   really changed   nothing   so far  as   corporate   management   was   concerned.   Thus,   in determining  whether   a   prohibited   interest   has   been   retained   under   section  302(c)(2)(A)(2),   we   must   look   to whether   the   former   stockholder has   either   retained   a   financial   stake   in   the   corporation   or  continued   to   control   the   corporation   and   benefit   by   its  operations.   In particular,   where   the interest   retained   is not that  of an   officer,   director,   or   employee,   we   must   examine   the   facts  and   circumstances   to   determine   whether   a   prohibited   interest has   been   retained   under   section   302(c)(2)(A)(i).  Lynch   v.   Commissioner,   83 T.C.   597,   605   (1984)   (citations   omitted). After   citing   the   “control   or   financial   stake”   standard,   the   Tax   Court  engaged   in   a   two-step   analysis.   First,   the   court   concluded   that   the taxpayer   was   an   independent   contractor   rather   than   an   employee  because   the   corporation   had   no   right   under   the   consulting   agreement   to  control   his   actions.   Second,   the   court   undertook   a   “facts   and  circumstances”   analysis   to   determine   whether   the   taxpayer   had   a  financial   stake   in   the   corporation   or   managerial   control   after   the  redemption.   Because   the   consulting   agreement   was   not   linked   to   the  future   profitability   of the   corporation,   the   court   found   that   the   taxpayer had   no   financial   stake.   The   court   also   found   no   evidence   that   the  taxpayer   exerted   control   over   the   corporation.   Thus,   the   Tax   Court determined   that   the   taxpayer   held   no   interest   prohibited   by   section  302(c)(2)(A)Q).  Ill  KKR*  We reject the Tax Court’s interpretation of section   302(c)(2)(A)@). An  individualized determination of whether a taxpayer has   retained a  financial   stake or continued to control   the corporation after the  redemption is inconsistent   with   Congress’ desire to bring a measure of  certainty to the  tax consequences of a corporate   redemption. We hold  that a taxpayer who provides post-redemption services,   either as an employee or an independent contractor,   holds a prohibited interest in the  corporation   because he is not a creditor.  The legislative   history of  section   302 states   that Congress   intended to provide “definite standards in order to provide   certainty in   specific ~instances.”   S.Rep.

216  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  from which the taxpayer may ascertain whether a given redemption” will  qualify as a sale or be   treated as   a dividend distribution. H.R.Rep.No.  1337, 83d Cong.2d Sess. 35, reprinted in 1954 U.S.Cong. &   Ad.News 4017,   4210. The facts and circumstances approach created by the Tax  Court undermines the ability   of taxpayers to execute a redemption and  know the tax consequences with certainty.  The   taxpayer’s   claim   that   the   Senate   rejected   the   mechanical  operation   of the   House’s   version   of section   302   is misleading.   The   Senate did   reject   the   House   bill   because   the   “definitive   conditions”   were  “unnecessarily   restrictive.”   S.Rep.No.1622,   83d   Cong.,   2d   Sess.   44,  reprinted   in 1954   U.S.Code   Cong.   & Ad.News   4621,   4675.   However,   the  Senate’s   response   was   to   add   paragraph   (b)(1)   to   section   302,   which  reestablished   the   flexible,   but   notoriously   vague,   “not   essentially  equivalent   to a dividend”   test.   This   test   provided   that   all payments   from  a corporation   that   were   not   essentially   equivalent   to   a   dividend   should  be   taxed   as   capital   gains.   The   confusion   that   stemmed   from   a   case-by-  case   inquiry   into   “dividend   equivalence”   prompted   the   Congress   to enact  definite   standards   for the safe harbors   in section   302(b)(2)   and   (b)(3). The Tax   Court’s   refusal   to recognize   that   section   302(c)(2)(A)(i)   prohibits   all  noncreditor   interests   in the   corporation   creates   the   same   uncertainty   as the   “dividend   equivalence”   test.  The   problem with the Tax Court’s approach is apparent when this  case is compared with Seda v. Commissioner, 82  T.C. 484 (1984). In Seda,  a former   shareholder, at his   son’s insistence, continued working for the  corporation for two   years after the redemption. He received a salary of  $1,000 per month.   The   Tax Court   refused to hold that   section 302(c)(2)(A)G)   prohibits the retention of employment relations   per se,  despite the unequivocal   language in the   statute.6 Id. at 488. Instead, the court applied the facts and  circumstances   approach to determine   whether the former   shareholder retained a financial   stake or continued to control the corporation. The   Tax   Court   found that   the monthly   payments of $1,000   constituted a financial   stake in the corporation. Id. This result is at odds   with the holding in Lynch that payments of $500 per month do  not constitute a financial   stake in the corporation. Compare Lynch, 83  T.C. at 606-07 with   Seda, 82   T.C. at 488. The court also found in Seda  no evidence that   the former   shareholder   had   ceased to manage the  corporation.   82 T.C. at 488. Again, this finding is contrary to the holding in Lynch that the taxpayer   exercised no  control   over   the corporation after the redemption, even though he worked daily for a year   and   shared his old office with his  son. Compare Lynch, 83  T.C. at 607   with   Seda,   82 T.C.  at  488. Seda   and   Lynch thus   vividly demonstrate the  perils   of making an ad  hoc determination of  “control” or “financial   stake.” 6 Eight of  the seventeen   Tax   Court judges  who   reviewed   Seda   concurred in  the  result  but  would   have classified all   officer,   director,   or employee   relationshi ibi i  Seah «SERRE Se ploy   atlonships as prohibited   interests

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  A recent   Tax   Court   opinion   further   illustrates   the imprecision   of the facts   and   circumstances   approach.   In Cerone   v. Commissioner,   87 T.C.   1  (1986),   a father   and   son   owned   all the   shares   of a corporation   formed   to  operate   their   restaurant.   The   corporation   agreed   to   redeem   all   of the father’s   shares   in   order   to   resolve   certain   disagreements   between   the  father   and   son   concerning   the management   of the business.   However,   the father   remained   an   employee   of the   corporation   for   at   least   five   years after the redemption,   drawing a salary of $14,400   for the first three   years  and   less   thereafter.   The   father   claimed   that   he   was   entitled   to   capital  gains   treatment   on   the   redemption   because   he   had   terminated   his  interest   in the   corporation   within   the   meaning   of section   302(b)(3). Even   on   the   facts   of Cerone,   the   Tax   Court   refused   to find   that   the  father   held   a   prohibited   employment   interest   per   se.   * * *   Instead,   the Tax   Court   engaged   in a lengthy   analysis,   citing   both   Seda   and   Lynch.  The   court   proclaimed   that   Lynch   reaffirmed   the   rationale   of Seda,   even  though   Lynch   involved   an   independent   contractor   rather   than   an employee.   After   comparing   the   facts   of Seda   and   Cerone,   the   Tax   Court eventually   concluded   that   the   father   in Cerone   held   a financial   stake   in the   corporation   because   he had   drawn a salary   that   was   $2,400   per   year more   than   the   taxpayer   in   Seda   and   had   been   employed   by   the  corporation   for a longer   period   after   the   redemption.   Cerone,   slip op.   at  53.   However,   the   Tax   Court   was   still concerned   that   prohibited   interest  in   Seda   might   have   been   based   on   the   finding   in   that   case   that   the taxpayer   had   both   a   financial   stake   and   continued   control   of   the corporation.   The   Tax   Court,   citing   Lynch,   held   that   the   “test   is whether  he   retained   a   financial   stake   or   continued   to   control   the   corporation.” ***   Thus,   the   Tax   Court   found   that   the   father   in   Cerone   held   a  prohibited   interest   because   he had a financial   stake   as   defined   by Seda. Although the Tax Court   reached the   correct   result   in Cerone, its approach   undermines the definite contours of the safe harbor   Congress  intended to create with sections   302(b)(3) and 302(c)(2)(A)(@). Whether a  taxpayer has a financial   stake according to the Tax   Court   seems to depend on two factors, length of employment and the amount of  salary. Length of employment after the redemption is irrelevant because Congress   wanted taxpayers to know   whether they were entitled to capital gains treatment on the   date   their shares   were redeemed. *  *  * As for the amount of annual salary,   the Tax Court’s   present benchmark appears to be  the $12,000 figure  in Seda.   Salary at or above this level will be deemed to be a financial   stake in   the   enterprise, though the $6,000   annual  payments in  this   case were   held   not to be a financial   stake. There is no  support in  the  legislative   history  of  section   302 for the idea that Congress  meant only to prohibit   service   contracts   of a certain  worth,   and taxpayers should   not   be left  to speculate as   to what   income level will  give  rise  to  a  financial   stake.  In   this   case,   the   taxpayer   points to   the   fact   that   the   taxpayers   in  Seda   and   Cerone   were   employees,   while   he   was   an   independent  217

218  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  contractor. On appeal, the Commissioner concedes the taxpayer's independent contractor status. We fail to see, however, any meaningful way to distinguish Seda   and Cerone   from Lynch by differentiating  between   employees and independent contractors. All   of the taxpayers  performed services for their corporations following the redemption. To hold that only the employee taxpayers held a prohibited interest would elevate form over substance. The parenthetical language in section  302(c)(2)(A)(i) merely provides a subset of prohibited interests from the  universe of such interests, and in  no way limits us from finding that an  independent contractor retains a prohibited interest. Furthermore, the  Tax Court has in effect come to ignore the parenthetical   language. If  employment relationships are not prohibited interests   per se, then the taxpayer’s status as an employee or independent contractor is irrelevant.  What really matters under the Tax Court’s approach is how the taxpayer  fares under a facts and   circumstances review of whether he   has a  financial stake in the corporation or managerial control.’ Tax   planners are left to guess where along the continuum of monthly payments from $500 to $1000 capital gains treatment ends and   ordinary income tax begins. Our   holding   today   that   taxpayers   who   provide   post-redemption  services   have   a   prohibited   interest   under   section   302(c)(2)(A)(G)   is inconsistent   with   the   Tax   Court’s   decision   in   Estate   of   Lennard   v.  Commissioner,   61   T.C.   554   (1974).   That   case   held   that   a   former  shareholder   who,   as   an   independent   contractor,   provided   post- redemption   accounting   services   for   a   corporation   did   not   have   a prohibited   interest.   The   Tax   Court   found   that   “Congress   did   not   intend  to include   independent   contractors   possessing   no   financial   stake   in the corporation   among   those   who   are   considered   as   retaining   an   interest   in the   corporation   for purposes   of the   attribution   waiver   rules.”   Id.   at 561.  We   disagree.   In the context   of Lennard,   the Tax   Court   appears   to be using financial   stake   in the   sense   of having   an   equity   interest   or   some   other  claim   linked   to the   future   profit   of the   corporation.   Yet,   in cases   such   as  Seda   and   Cerone,   the   Tax   Court   has   found   that   fixed   salaries   of $12,000  and   $14,400,   respectively,   constitute   a   financial   stake.   Fees   for  accounting   services   could   easily   exceed   these   amounts,   and   it would   be irrational   to argue   that   the definition   of financial   stake   varies   depending  on   whether   the taxpayer   is an   employee   or an   independent   contractor.   In  7 The   Tax Court’s   focus   on managerial control or  a financial stake  originated   with Judge Simpson’s   concurrence in Lewis,   47 T.C. at 136-38.   His   interpretation of section   302(c)(2)(A) is supported   by Bittker, Stock Redemptions and Partial Liquidations Under the Internal Revenue  Code of  1954,   9  Stan. L. Rev. 13, 33 n. 72   (1956). Professor   Bittker   argues that Congress’ goal  was to ensure that taxpayers who transferred   only ostensible   control or maintained a financial stake in the corporation did not   receive   the  benefit   of  capital   gains   treatment. He is no doubt correct, However, the means selected by   Congress to achieve this goal   do   not   allow for an  individualized   determination of  control and financial   stakes.   Instead,   section   302(c)(2)(A)(i)  operates   mechanically:   the taxpayer   must sever all but a creditor’s   interest to avoid   the  family  attribution  rules and   thereby   receive   capital  gains  treatment. Nowhere in  the  legislative   histor  of section   302(c)   does   Congress   intimate   that   courts may use a flexible   facts and   Sresuuitegenes  test  to determine   the  existence   of managerial   control   or a  financial   stake.

--- Page 289 ---

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 219  order to avoid   these   inconsistencies, we   conclude that those who provide post-redemption services, whether as independent contractors or employees, hold an   interest prohibited by section 302(c)(2)(A)(i) because  they are more than merely creditors. In addition,   both   the   Tax   Court   and   the   Commissioner   have   agreed that taxpayers   who   enter   into management   consulting   contracts   after the  redemption   possess   prohibited   interests.   Chertkof   v.   Commissioner,   72  T.C.   1113,   1124-25   (1979),   aff'd, 649   F.2d   264   (4th Cir.1981);   Rev.Ruling  70-104,   1970—1   C.B.   66 (1970).   Taxpayers   who   provide   such   services   are,  of course,   independent   contractors.   However,   unlike   the   Commissioner’s  opinion   in   Rev.   Ruling   70-104   that   all   management   consulting  agreements   are prohibited   interests,   the Tax   Court   applies   the   financial  stake   or   managerial   control   test.   In   Chertkof,   the   court   found   that because   the   services   provided   under   the contract   “went   to the   essence”   of the   corporation’s   existence,   the   taxpayer   had   not   effectively   ceded  control.   72   T.C.   at   1124.   Here,   the   Tax   Court   distinguished   Chertkof   on  the   ground   that   the   taxpayer   did   not   retain   control   of the   corporation, but   instead   provided   only   limited   consulting   services.   Lynch,   88   T.C.   at 608.   We   believe   that   any   attempt   to define   prohibited   interests   based   on the   level   of control   leads   to   the   same   difficulties   inherent   in   making   a  case-by-case   determination   of what   constitutes   a financial   stake.§  IV  Our   decision   today   comports   with   the   plain   language   of section   302  and   its   legislative   history.   See   Gardner   &   Randall,   Distributions   in Redemption   of Stock:   Changing   Definitions   for a Termination   of Interest,  8 J. Corp.   Tax’n   240,   247—48   (1981);   Marusic,   The   Prohibited   Interest   of I.R.C.   Section   302(c)(2)(A)(G)   After   Seda   and   Lynch,   65   Neb.   L. Rev.   486, 502,   518-19   (1986);   Rose,   The   Prohibited   Interest   of Section   302(c)(2)(A),  36 Tax   L. Rev.   131,   145—49   (1981).   Taxpayers   who   wish   to receive   capital  gains   treatment   upon   the   redemption   of their   shares   must   completely  sever   all   noncreditor   interests   in   the   corporation.   We   hold   that   the  aaa  8 Determining the existence of control is particularly difficult in the  context of a family- held corporation. The exercise of control  often will not  be obvious because a parent may influence  a child, and   hence   corporate decisionmaking, in myriad ways. Our rule that   the provision of  services is  a prohibited interest eliminates the need to make a speculative   inquiry into whether  the parent still controls   the corporation after the redemption.   Of course, no   rule could or should prohibit post-redemption parent-child communication concerning the management of the  corporation.  ® Our definition   of a prohibited interest still leaves   an open   question as  to the permissible  scope of a creditor’s   interest under section 302(c)(2)(A)(a).   See, e.g., Treas.   Reg. § 1.302—4(d) (a  creditor’s claim must not  be subordinate to the  claims of general creditors or in any   other   sense  ~ proprietary, i.e., principal payments or interest   rates must not  be contingent on   the earnings of the  corporation). The   taxpayer   argues that some creditor   relationships   might result   in an “opportunity to  influence” as great or greater   than   any officer, director, or employee relationship. He cites Rev. Ruling   77-467,   1977-2 C.B.   92 which   concluded   that a taxpayer   who leased   real property to a  corporation,   after   the   corporation   redeemed his   shares,   held a creditor’s   interest under section  302(c)(2)(A)(i). While   the   taxpayer   here may be   correct   in   his assessment of   a   creditor’s  “opportunity to  influence” a corporation,   he overlooks   the  fact  that  Congress   specifically   allowed the right  to  retain   such   an   interest. ;

220  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  taxpayer, as an independent contractor, held such a noncreditor interest, and so cannot find shelter in the safe harbor of section 302(c)(2)(A)Q). Accordingly, the family attribution rules of section 318 apply and the taxpayer fails to qualify for a complete redemption under section 302(b)(3). The payments from the corporation in redemption of the taxpayer’s   shares must be characterized as a dividend distribution  taxable as ordinary income   under section 301.  Reversed.  Revenue   Ruling   59-119  1959-1   Cum.   Bull.   68.  A   stock   redemption   agreement   between   the   corporation   and   the instant   shareholder   provides   that   a total   of 350x   dollars   will   be   paid   to  such   shareholder   for all his stock   interest   in the corporation,   100x   dollars  to   be   paid   on   the   closing   date   and   250x   dollars   to   be   paid   by   the corporation   within   eight   years,   payable   in quarter-annual   installments. The   corporation   executed   an   installment   judgment   note   to   the shareholder   and   the judgment   note   and   shares   of stock   of the corporation to   be   redeemed   are   retained   by   an   escrow   holder   as   security   for installment   payments   due.   In   the   event   the   installment   and   interest payments   are   in   default,   then   pursuant   to   the   agreement   the   escrow holder,   upon   notice   from   the   taxpayer,   may   sell   the   stock   of   the corporation   held   by   him   at   public   or   private   sale   to   satisfy   such obligations,   however,   in no   event   will the taxpayer   become   the purchaser  of said   stock   at such   sale.  The stock redemption   agreement also states that so long as the corporation   owes   funds to such shareholder it will   not, without first  receiving the written   consent of the shareholder, declare   dividends; pay  salaries   in excess of a certain amount to officers; sell  its assets except in  the ordinary course of business; or engage in a reorganization,  recapitalization, merger,   consolidation or liquidation. Because of the substantial sums due the shareholder,   because   he plans to reside permanently in another state and will be far removed  from the base of operations of the corporation, and   pursuant to the  advice of persons skilled   in creditor protection matters, he considers it advisable  to have a member of  the law firm representing him serve   on   the   board of  directors of the   corporation.   Therefore, the   instant shareholder   and the  remaining shareholders, all related, entered into a second agreement  whereby a nominee of his law   firm will serve   on   the board of  directors as  long as the corporation is indebted to the shareholder.   Such   nominee will be paid x dollars by the  corporation for each   meeting   he attends   and   such additional   sums as determined in   the   sole discretion   of   the   instant  shareholder for other   services which   may be   reasonably   necessary to  determine   that   his   interests   as   a creditor   are being   protected   in  accordance   with   the   agreements.

--- Page 291 ---

*  CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL LIQUIDATIONS  The   sole   purpose   of this   arrangement   is to   protect   the   shareholder  as   a   creditor   by   determining   that   the   aforementioned   conditions   are being   met   rather   than   running   the   risk   of having   to engage   in extended litigation   at some   future   date   if it is then   determined   that   the conditions of the   stock   redemption   agreement   were   violated.  *R*  According   to the   agreement   in question,   the remaining   shareholders  and   the instant   shareholder   will appoint,   indirectly   through   the law firm  representing   such   shareholder,   a member   of that law   firm   to serve   on   the  board   of directors   of the   corporation.   Such   a   nominee   director   will   be  acting   solely   on   the   taxpayer’s   behalf   and,   therefore,   will   in effect   be his  agent.   The   fact   that   the   nominee   director   will   receive   remuneration   for his service   from   someone   other   than   the taxpayer   does   not   make   him   any  less   the   taxpayer’s   agent,   for the   source   of remuneration   to an   agent   is  only one   factor   to be considered   in determining   whether   an   agency   exists between   two   parties.   Such   an   appointment   of an   agent   to the   board   of directors   is contrary   to the condition   prescribed   in section   302(c)(2)   of the  Code.   For   the   purposes   of section   302(c)(2),   it is immaterial   whether   an  interest   in the   corporation   is asserted   directly   or through   an   agent.  The   fact that   the   director   is a “limited”   director   in that his only duty will   be   to   determine   whether   the   conditions   set   forth   in   the   stock  redemption   agreement   are   being   observed   is not   material,   for   section 302(c)(2)   of the   Code   does   not   make   any   exception   for   such   directors.  Furthermore,   that   section   of the   Code   does   not   make   an   exception   for   a  director   whose   power   is limited   because   he   is a   minority   member   of a  board.  In view   of the   foregoing,   it is held   that   the   agreement   between   the  instant   shareholder   and   the   remaining   shareholders   of the   corporation, under   which   a nominee   is appointed   to serve   on   the board   of directors   of  the corporation,   violates   the condition   prescribed   in section   302(c)(2)(A)Q)  of   the   Code.   Accordingly,   in   the   event   of   such   an   agreement,   the redemption   of the   taxpayer’s   stock   of the   corporation   shall   be treated   as a distribution   of property   to which   section   301   of the   Code   applies. However, if the taxpayer-shareholder designates a representative of his law firm to attend the board of director’s meetings of the corporation solely for the purposes of determining   whether the provisions of  the  agreement described   above   have   been   complied with, and not   in   the  capacity of a director,   officer or employee, or advisor, such action will not  _adversely affect section   302(c)(2)   of  the   Code.

222  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  X for many years as its vice-president and general assistant to the president. Realizing that   the future successful operation of X required a thorough knowledge of its operation, products lines, and customer needs,  A had trained and   supervised B in all phases of the business so that upon  A’s retirement B would be able to assume responsibility for managing the business.  As part   of A’s plan to retire   from   the business   and   to give ownership of the business   to B, A gave   60 shares   of   X stock   to Bas   a gift, and   not   as consideration   for past,   present,   or   future   services.   Shortly   thereafter,   A  resigned   and-B   assumed   the   position   of   chairman   of   the   board   and  president   of X. X redeemed   the   remaining   60   shares   of stock   owned   by A in exchange   for   property.   Immediately   after   the   redemption,   A   was   not an   officer,   director,   or employee   of X and   no   longer   had   any   interest   in X. A’s   gift of stock   to B was   for the   purpose   of giving   B complete   ownership and   control   of X.   The   earnings   and   profits   of X   exceeded   the   amount   of the   distribution   in redemption   of the   X stock.  ***  In the   instant   case,   neither   section   302(b)(1)   of the   Code   nor   section 302(b)(2)   applies   since   A,   through   the   constructive   ownership   rules   of  section   318(a),   owned   100   percent   of the   stock   of X both   before   and   after  the   redemption.   Therefore,   there   was   no   meaningful   reduction   under  section   302(b)(1)   or   a   substantially   disproportionate   reduction   under section   302(b)(2)   of A’s   stock   ownership. Section 302(c)(2)(A) of the Code provides that for purposes of section  302(b)(3), 318(a)(1) will not apply if (i) immediately after the distribution the distributee has no interest in the corporation (including an   interest as an officer, director, or employee), other than an interest as   a creditor,  (i) the   distributee   does not acquire   any   such interest   (other than stock  acquired by  bequest or inheritance)   within ten years from the   date of such distribution, and (iii) the distributee files an agreement to notify  the  district director of any acquisition of any   such interest in the corporation.  However,   pursuant to section   302(c)(2)(B)Gi),   the provisions of section 302(c)(2)(A) are not applicable if any   person   owns (at the time of the distribution)   stock   the ownership of which is attributable to the  distributee under section   318(a) and   such   person   acquired   any stock   in the   corporation, directly or indirectly, from the   distributee within the  ten-year   period ending on the   date of the   distribution,   unless   such stock so acquired   from the   distributee is redeemed in the*same transaction.  However, section   302(c)(2)(B)(ii)   will not apply if the   disposition by the distributee   did not have as one   of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal   income tax. The   structure   and legislative   history of  section   302   of  the Code   make  it clear   that   the   purpose of   section   302(c)(2)(B) is not   to prevent   the  reduction   of  capital   gains   through gifts  of appreciated   stock   prior   to the  redemption of  the   remaining   stock   of  the   transferor,   but to prevent   the

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 223  withdrawal of earnings at capital gains rates by a shareholder of a family  controlled corporation who seeks continued control and/or economic  interest in the corporation through the   stock given to a related person or the   stock he retains. Application of this provision   thus prevents a taxpayer from bailing out earnings by transferring part of the taxpayer’s stock to such a related person and then qualifying the redemption of  either   the taxpayer’s stock or the   transferee’s   stock as   a complete  termination of interest by virtue of the division of ownership thus   created and the   availability of the attribution waiver provisions.  Tax   avoidance   within   the   meaning   of section   302(c)(2)(B)   of the Code  would   occur,   for example,   if a taxpayer   transfers   stock   of a corporation   to  a spouse   in contemplation   of the redemption   of the remaining   stock of the  corporation   and   terminates   all   direct   interest   in   the   corporation   in  compliance   with   section   302(c)(2)(A),   but   with   the   intention   of retaining  effective   control   of the   corporation   indirectly   through   the   stock   held   by  the   spouse.   Another   example,   which   would   generally   constitute   tax  avoidance   within   the   meaning   of this   provision,   is   the   transfer   by   a taxpayer   of part of the stock of a corporation   to a spouse   in contemplation of the   subsequent   redemption   of the   transferred   stock   from   the   spouse.  ee  Whether   one   of   the   principal   purposes   of   an   acquisition   or disposition   of   stock   is   tax   avoidance   within   the   meaning   of   section 302(c)(2)(B)   of the   Code   can   be   determined   only by an   analysis   of all of  the   facts   and   circumstances   of a particular   situation.   Here,   the   gift of X  stock   by A was   to B who   is active   and   knowledgeable   in the affairs   of the  business   of X and   who   intends   to control   and   manage   the   corporation   in  the   future.   The   gift   of   stock   was   intended   solely   for   the   purpose   of enabling   A   to   retire   while   leaving   the   business   to   B.   Therefore,   the  avoidance   of Federal   income   tax   will   not   be   deemed   to have   been   one   of the   principal   purposes   of the   gift of stock   from   A   to B, notwithstanding  the   reduction   of the   capital   gains   tax   payable   by A   as a result   of the   gift  of appreciated   stock   prior to the   redemption. Accordingly, if A files the agreement specified in   section  302(c)(2)(A)(iii)   of  the Code, the redemption   by X of its stock from A qualifies as   a termination of  interest under section   302(b)(8). Rev. Rul. 57-387,   1957-2 C.B.   225, is modified to the   extent   that it  contains   implications to the contrary   concerning the reduction of  the capital   gains tax.  “NOTE  Ten-Year-Look-Forward Rule. The   prohibition on retaining or acquiring any   post-redemption “interest”   (other   than as   a creditor or by  bequest or inheritance)   in  the  corporation is one   of  the  major  hurdles to  utilizing  Section

The   Service   has   ruled   that   a   prohibited interest   is obtained   if the   redeemed   shareholder   becomes   a custodian   under the Uniform   Gifts   to Minors   Act or a voting   trustee   of corporate   stock   during  the restricted   ten year   period.?6   But   if the shareholder   becomes   executor   of a  deceased   shareholder’s   estate   and   can   vote   the   stock   held   by the   estate,   the protection   of Section   302(c)(2)   is still available   by virtue   of the   exception   for  stock   acquired   by bequest   or inheritance.37   In Revenue   Ruling   72—380,38   the  Service   ruled that   since   a redeemed   shareholder   may   reacquire   a direct   stock  interest   by bequest   or   inheritance,   it was   reasonable   to permit   “acquisition  under   identical   circumstances   of the   significantly   lesser   interest   embodied  in the * * * right of an   executor   to vote   stock   in an   estate   * * * .”39 In Revenue Ruling   79-3344   the   same   reasoning   was   applied   to an   appointment   by will of a   previously   redeemed   shareholder   as   a   trustee   of a   trust.   The   ruling concludes   that   a redeemed   shareholder   may   waive   family   attribution   even  though,   as trustee,   he can   vote   stock   of the   corporation   in which   he once   had an   interest.  Deferred Payment Redemptions. In the   area of deferred payment redemptions, the Service and the   courts have   disagreed over what  constitutes a complete   termination of a shareholder’s interest or the acquisition of a forbidden   proprietary interest for purposes of the waiver of  family attribution   exception.

First,   the redemption   must be   treated as an  exchange rather   than a dividend.   In addition,   Section   453(k)(2)(A)   denies   use   of  the  installment method for   sales   of  stock or securities which are traded on   an   established   securities market. This   provision   thus   limits   the   tax advantage of  deferral   on   a  credit redemption to redemptions of  stock in closely   held   corporations.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 225  unless the redeemed shareholder acquires stock in the corporation, its parent  corporation, or  a subsidiary.4?  The   standards   applied   by the   courts   to credit   redemptions   are   not   as  rigid.   In   Dunn   y.   Commissioner,#?   a   redemption   agreement   provided   for postponement   of principal   and   interest   payments   on   corporate   notes   given in payment   for the shareholder’s   stock   if such   payments   would   violate   financial  requirements   in the corporation’s   franchise   agreement   with   General   Motors.  The   court   concluded   that   the   postponement   provision   did   not   require   the  notes   to be   classified   as   equity   or   give   the   shareholder   an   interest   in the  corporation   other   than   as a creditor.   In Estate   of Lennard   v. Commissioner,*4 the   court   found   that   a   subordinated   demand   note,   which   was   paid  approximately   three   months   after   issuance,   did not   represent   a proprietary interest   in the   corporation.  The   Service   has   specific   guidelines   for granting   a favorable   ruling under  Section   302.   For   example,   it ordinarily   will not   rule   on   the tax   consequences  of a   redemption   of stock   for   notes   when   the   note   payment   period   extends  beyond   15 years.4®   Nor   will a ruling be issued   under   Section   302(b)   if: (1) the  shareholder’s   stock   is held in escrow   or as security for payments   on corporate  notes   given   as   consideration   for the   redeemed   stock,   or   (2) the   consideration given   to   the   shareholder   is   entirely   or   partly   contingent   on   either   future corporate   earnings   or   maintenance   of levels   of corporate   working   capital,   or  any   other   similar   contingency.‘¢   In these   situations,   the   Service’s   concern   is that the redeemed   shareholder   either   may   reacquire   stock   in the corporation  or has   retained   a proprietary   stake   in its possible   future   success.  Once   again,   however,   the   courts   have   been   far   more   lenient   than   the  I.R.S.’s   ruling   position.   For   example,   in   Lisle   v.   Commissioner4’   the   Tax  Court   found   a   Section   302(b)(3)   complete   termination   where   the   redeemed  shareholders   were   to   be   paid   for   their   stock   over   a   20   year   period,   the  shareholders   retained   their   voting   rights   pursuant   to a security   agreement,  the   stock   was   held   in escrow   and   could   be returned   to the   shareholders   and  the   shareholders   continued   to serve   as   corporate   directors   and   officers.   The  court   concluded   that   the   shareholders   were   directors   and   officers   in name only   and   that,   based   upon   the   facts   present   in   the   case,   the   security  provisions   were   not inconsistent   with   a finding that the transaction   qualified as   a complete   redemption.  Other Post-Redemption Interests. The Service will permit a redeemed  shareholder to lease property to the corporation on   an arms   length basis  , provided that   the   rental payments are not dependent on corporate   earnings  or subordinated to the   claims of  the   corporation’s   general creditors.*8  “   42   Reg.   § 1.302—4(e). 43   615   F.2d   578   (2d Cir.1980).  44   Note   35, supra.  45   Rev.

The issue   in Lisle was   whether there   was a complete termination of the   shareholder’s   interest. The case   did not   involve a waiver   of  family   attribution   issue.  48 Rev.   Rul.   77-467,   1977-2   C.B.   92.

226  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Retention of   Multiple Interests. A shareholder of a closely held corporation often will retain   several different types of interests   after a  redemption. This raises the question of whether, in determining if the shareholder has   retained a prohibited financial stake, we look to each  separate economic relationship, or to the totality   of continuing interests? In Hurst v. Commissioner,*? the Tax Court rejected the   Service’s argument that multiple interests taken together can   constitute a prohibited interest and  concluded that each interest must be analyzed separately. The   taxpayers in  Hurst were a husband and wife who   owned stock in two corporations (“A”  and “B”).59 Mr. and Mrs. Hurst each   were   stockholders of A but only Mr. Hurst owned stock of B. To implement retirement and succession   planning, they first sold their A stock to B. B then redeemed 90 percent of Mr.   Hurst’s  B stock, and he sold the remaining 10 percent to his son and two unrelated  parties. Both the redemption and sale provided for a 15-year payment term and the corporation’s payment obligation was   secured by the redeemed or sold B stock. The Hursts   continued to own B’s corporate headquarters, which they leased back to B; and Mrs. Hurst (remember, she was not a B shareholder) continued as a B employee. All the various agreements (stock purchase, redemption, lease, and employment contract) were cross- collateralized by Mr.   Hurst’s B stock.  The principal issue was whether the redemption of Mr.   Hurst’s B stock qualified as  a complete   termination   under Section 302(b)(3) after application  of the waiver of family attribution rules in Section 302(c). The   Tax Court rejected  the  Service’s arguments that the “total number of related   obligations  resulting from the transaction   gave the [taxpayers] a prohibited interest”  that was tantamount to  a financial stake in the company’s continued success.  It held that Mr. Hurst did  not  retain any   prohibited interests by virtue of the 15-year promissory notes   (they were not tied to the corporation’s   financial performance,   and   using the   stock as collateral was consistent   with common practice), the   lease (it had a fixed   rent   that was reasonable), or his   wife’s employment agreement (she owned no B stock, her compensation was not related to the corporation’s   financial performance,   and there was no evidence that   she was acting as   a surrogate manager for her husband).  Although it involved   taxable   years   before   the effective date of the dividend rate reduction, Hurst is  a good example of why, even   apart from  basis   recovery, characterization still can matter   under the current rate regime. Redemptions of  closely held   stock in the   typical “family   business”  setting are frequently   funded with   installment notes. If the redemption is  treated as an exchange   under Section   302, installment sale reporting under  Section   453 is available,   but   there is immediate gain   recognition if the distribution is a dividend.  redeemed shareholder   and the payments for the   use   of the property are dependent   upon the corporation’s   future earnings (other than a fixed percentage of   receipts or sales) or are  subordinate to the   claims of  the   corporation’s   general creditors.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS PPX  b.   WAIVER   OF   ATTRIBUTION   BY   ENTITIES  Section   302(c)(2)   only permits   waiver   of the family   attribution   rules and   requires   the   “distributee”   to   file   an   agreement   promising   to notify the   Service   of the   acquisition   of a forbidden   interest   within   the   ten   year period   following   the   redemption.   What   if the   redeemed   shareholder   is a  trust,   estate   or other   entity that completely   terminates   its actual   interest in the corporation   but   continues   to own   shares   attributed   to a beneficiary  from   a   related   family   member   which   then   are   reattributed   from   the beneficiary   to the   entity?5!   May   the   entity   waive   family   attribution   or is  the   waiver   opportunity   limited   to individual   shareholders? At one   time,   the   Service   contended   that   only individuals   could   waive  family   attribution.52   The   Tax   Court   disagreed,   however,   holding   that   an  estate   or   trust   that   completely   terminated   its   actual   interest   in   a  redemption   could   waive   family   attribution   from   a   family   member   to   a  beneficiary.®?   One   appellate   court,   rejecting   what   it called   a   “crabbed  reading”   of the   Code,   even   held   that   an   entity   could   waive   attribution from   a beneficiary   to the   entity.54   The   problem   with   these   decisions   was that   they   did   not   prevent   the   beneficiary   from   acquiring   an   interest   in  the   corporation   during   the   ten   years   after   the   redemption   or   require   an  agreement   from   the   beneficiary   to notify   the   Service   if such   a forbidden  interest   were   acquired. Technical   as   it may   seem,   this   issue   was   of considerable   interest   to  shareholders   of closely   held   corporations   and   their   estate   planners.   The Service’s   rigid   position   often   was   an   impediment   to a redemption   of the  stock   of an   estate   or   trust   where   family   members   of the   beneficiaries  continued   to   own   shares   of the   company.   In   the   midst   of continuing  litigation,   Congress   enacted   a   special   rule   for   waiver   by   entities,  incorporating   appropriate   safeguards   to preclude   the   beneficiaries   from  reacquiring   an   interest.55   The   Joint   Committee   on   Taxation   explained  the   rule   as   follows:56 The Act permits an   entity to waive the family   attribution  rules if those through whom ownership is attributed to the  51 For example, assume Mother’s Estate, of which   Father is the sole beneficiary, owns 50 of  the   100 outstanding shares of X Corporation stock. The other   50 shares are owned by Child.  If X redeems Estate’s   50  shares,   Estate   continues to constructively own Child’s 50 shares, which  are attributed   from Child to Father via family   attribution and   then   reattributed   from   Father to  Estate. May Estate   break the family   attribution   chain in order to qualify   the redemption as   a  complete   termination?  82 Rev. Rul. 59-233,   1959-2 C.B.  106,  Rev. Rul. 68-388,   1968-2 C.B. 122.  53 See Crawford v. Commissioner, 59  T.C. 830 (1973); Johnson Trust v. Commissioner, 71 ~T.C.   941 (1979); but see Metzger Trust v.

Thus,   a trust   and   its beneficiaries   may  waive   family   attribution   to   the   beneficiaries   if,   after   the  redemption,   neither   the   trust   nor   the   beneficiaries   hold   an  interest   in   the   corporation,   do   not   acquire   such   an   interest within   the   10-year   period,   and   join   in   the   agreement   to   notify  the   IRS   of   any   acquisition.   The   entity   and   beneficiaries   are  jointly   and   severally   liable   in the   event   of an   acquisition   by any  of them   within   the   10-year   period   and   the   statute   of limitations  remains   open   to   assess   any   deficiency.   The   tax   increase   is   a deficiency   in the entity’s   tax but   may   be asserted   as   a deficiency  against   any   beneficiary   lable   under   the   rules.   Congress intended   that   the   tax   will   be   collected   from   a beneficiary   only  when   it cannot   be assessed   against   or collected   from   the   entity, such   as   when   the   entity   no   longer   exists   or   has   insufficient  funds.   Further,   it was   intended   that   the tax will be assessed   and  collected   from   the   beneficiary   whose   acquisition   causes   the  deficiency   before   it is asserted   against   any   other   beneficiary. Under   the   Act,   only   family   attribution   under   Section  318(a)(1)   may   be waived   by an   entity   and   its beneficiaries.   The  waiver   rules   are   not   extended   to waivers   of attribution   to   and  from   entities   and   their   beneficiaries   (secs.   318(a)(2)   and 318(a)(3)).   The   Act   thus   is intended   to overrule   Rickey   v. United States,   592   F.2d   1251   (5th   Cir.1979).   Congress   intended   that  the   Act   should   not   be   construed   to provide   any   inference   as   to  whether   the   Rickey   decision   adopts   a   proper   construction   of  prior   law.   Nor   was   any   inference   intended   as   to   whether   the other   cases   extending   the   waiver   rules   for family   attribution   to entities   adopt   a proper   construction   of prior law. Certain   anti-avoidance rules applicable where the  redeemed stock was   acquired by the   distributee from a related  party or a related party at the time of the redemption   owns stock acquired   from the   distributee are extended to the   entity and affected   beneficiaries.  PROBLEMS  1. Randall   Corporation is owned   by John,   John’s daughter Alison   and  Alison’s   son Chuck.   John   owns 100   shares of Randall stock, Alison owns 50 shares   and Chuck   owns 25   shares. Consider   whether the   following  redemptions (in year   one)   qualify as an exchange   under 302(b)(3): (a) Randall   redeems Alison’s   entire   50  shares for cash. (b) Same as (a), above,   except   that   Alison fails   to file the  agreement   required in § 302(c)(2)(A)(iii)? What is the purpose  of  this requirement?  (c) Same as   (a), above,   except   the   price   paid for  Alison’s   shares is  contingent   upon   Randall’s   future   profits?

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  (d)   Randall   redeems   20 of Alison’s   shares   for cash   on   January   1 of year   one   and   the remaining   30 shares   for cash   on   January   1 of  year   two.  (e)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   Alison   remains   as   a   director   of Randall?  (f)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that,   two   years   after   the  redemption,   Randall   forms   a   new   subsidiary   and   Alison  becomes   an   employee   of the   subsidiary?  (g)   Same   as   (a), above,   except   that   two   years   after the redemption Chuck   dies   and   leaves   his Randall   shares   to Alison?  2.   The   B   &   B Windshield   Wiper   Corporation   (“B &   B”) was   organized   ten years   ago   by   Betty   and   Billy,   who   are   wife   and   husband.   Betty   and   Billy formed   B   & B   by transferring   cash   and   other   property   to the   corporation   in exchange   for   150   shares   of the   corporation’s   common   stock.   Betty   and   Billy own   B   &   B’s   manufacturing   plant   and   lease   the   plant   to the   corporation   for  an   annual   rental   fee.   B & B has been   very   successful   and has   a large amount  of accumulated   earnings   and   profits. Five   years   ago,   Betty   and   Billy’s   youngest   Son,   Junior,   began   working for   B &   B   as   a   clerk   in   the   domestic   subcompact   wiper   division.   Junior’s managerial   talents   were   quickly   recognized   and   he has   risen   rapidly   inB   &  B’s corporate   structure.   Today,   Junior   is B & B’s Vice   President   in charge   of operations   and   has   overall   responsibility   for   production   at   B   &   B’s manufacturing   plant.  Shortly   after   Junior   came   to   B   &   B, his   parents   agreed   that   he   would eventually   take   over   control   and   management   of the   company.   Betty   and  Billy have   now   decided   that   the   time   has   come   to retire.   To   implement   this  decision,   their   accountant   has   suggested   the   following   plan:  e   Betty   and   Billy will give 30 of their   150   B & B shares   to Junior  to provide   him   with   an   ownership   interest   in the   corporation. e B&Bwill redeem Betty and Billy's remaining 120 shares for $50,000 plus a $400,000 B &   B note paying market rate interest. The note will be payable monthly over a 20-year   term  and will be secured by an   interest in the corporation’s assets.  Additionally, B   &   B will agree to restrict dividend payments, limit new indebtedness,   and refrain from   taking certain  * extraordinary   corporate action (e.g., merger or liquidation)  during the term of  the note. e Betty   and Billy will continue to lease   the manufacturing plant to B &   B   under a lease which has a rent   escalation   clause  dependent   upon the consumer price index. They also  will grant  B  & Ba five year   option to purchase the  plant at its appraised fair market value. (a) Will   Betty   and Billy’s redemption be   classified   as an  exchange   under   Section   302(a)? (b) Suppose   Betty   establishes a management   consulting   firm  after  leaving   B &  B.  What   would   be the tax  impact   on   the  229

Cinelab   Corporation   has   100   shares   of common   stock   outstanding.   John  owns   50 shares   and   Mary,   John’s   sister,   owns   30 shares.   The   other   20 shares  are   owned   by the   Estate   of Sam;   Sam   was   John   and   Mary’s   father.   Their  mother,   Bella,   is   the   sole   beneficiary   of   the   estate.   Consider   the   tax  consequences   of the following   redemptions   of Cinelab   stock:  (a)   Cinelab   redeems   Estate’s   20 shares. (b)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that   Bella   is   the   residuary  beneficiary   of   the   estate   and   John   and   Mary   each   receive  specific   legacies.  (c)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that   John   and   Mary   are   the  residuary   beneficiaries   of the   estate.  (d)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   the   20   shares   were   owned   and  redeemed   from   a trust   established   under   Sam’s   will providing  income   to   Bella   for   her   life   and   the   remainder   to   Nancy,  another   child   of Sam   and   Bella.   The   life estate   and   remainder  have   equal   actuarial   values.  (e) Any change in the result in (d), above, if Nancy acquires stock  in Cinelab three   years after the redemption   by the  trust?  3. REDEMPTIONS   NOT   ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO A  DIVIDEND  Code:   § 302(b)(1).  Regulations:   § 1.3022.  United States v. Davis  Supreme Court of the United States,   1970.  397 U.S.   301,   90 S.Ct. 1041, rehearing denied, 397 U.S.   1071,   90 S.Ct. 1495 (1970).  = MR.   JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the   Court.  In   1945, taxpayer   and E.B.   Bradley   organized a corporation.   In  exchange for property   transferred to the new   company,   Bradley received  500   shares of common stock, and   taxpayer   and his wife   similarly   each  ae  received   250   such shares. Shortly thereafter, taxpayer made an  additional contribution to the   corporation, purchasing 1,000   shares of  preferred   stock at a par   value of $25 per   share.  The   purpose of  this  latter transaction Was to increase   the company’s working capital and   thereby to qualify for   a loan   previously   negotiated through the Reconstruction   Finance   Corporation. It was   understood that  the  corporation   would   redeem the  preferred   stock when the RFC loan   had  been   repaid. Although in   the   interim   taxpayer   bought   Bradley’s   500 shares   and   divided   them   between his   son   and   daughter,   the   total  capitalization   of the company   remained   the   same   unti . That  year,

--- Page 301 ---

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  after the   loan was fully repaid and in accordance with the   original  understanding, the company-redeemed taxpayer’s   preferred stock.  In his   1963   personal   income   tax   return   taxpayer did not report the $25,000   received   by him   upon   the   redemption   of his   preferred   stock   as  income.   Rather,   taxpayer   considered   the   redemption   as   a   sale   of his  preferred   stock   to the company—a   capital   gains   transaction   under § 302  of the   Internat   Revenue   Code   of 1954   resulting   in no   tax since taxpayer’s  basis   in   the   stock   equaled   the   amount   he   received   for   it.   The  Commissioner   of Internal   Revenue,   however,   did   not   approve   this   tax  treatment.   According   to the   Commissioner,   the redemption   of taxpayer’s  stock   was   essentially   equivalent   to   a dividend   and   was   thus   taxable   as  ordinary   income   under   §§ 301   and   316   of the   Code.   Taxpayer   paid   the resulting   deficiency   and brought   this suit for a refund.   The   District   Court  ruled   in his   favor,   274   F.Supp.   466   (M.D.Tenn.1967),   and   on   appeal   the  Court   of Appeals   affirmed.   408   F.2d   1139   (C.A.6th   Cir.1969).  The   Court   of Appeals   held that the   $25,000   received   by taxpayer   was “not   essentially   equivalent   to   a   dividend”   within   the   meaning   of that  phrase   in   § 302(b)(1)   of the   Code   because   the   redemption   was   the   final  step   in a course   of action   that   had   a legitimate   business   (as opposed   to a  tax   avoidance)   purpose.   That   holding   represents   only one   of a variety   of  treatments   accorded   similar   transactions   under   § 302(b)(1)   in the circuit courts   of appeals.   We   granted   certiorari,   396   U.S.   815   (1969),   in order   to resolve   this recurring   tax question   involving   stock redemptions   by closely  held   corporations.   We   reverse.  i  The   Internal   Revenue   Code   of 1954   provides   generally   in §§ 301   and 316   for   the   tax   treatment   of   distributions   by   a   corporation   to   its shareholders;   under   those   provisions,   a   distribution   is includable   in   a taxpayer’s   gross   income   as   a dividend   out   of earnings   and   profits   to the  extent   such   earnings   exist.   There   are   exceptions   to   the   application   of  these   general   provisions,   however,   and   among   them   are   those   found   in  § 302   involving   certain   distributions   for   redeemed   stock.   The   basic  question   in   this   case   is   whether   the   $25,000   distribution   by   the corporation   to   taxpayer   falls   under   that   section—more   specifically,  under   § 302(b)(1)   of the   Code.   Preliminarily,   however,   we   mu   I  the-relationship   between   § 302(b)(1)   and   the   rules   regarding   the  attribution   of stock   ownership   found   in § 318(a)   of the   Code.  Under subsection (a) of § 302, a distribution is treated as “payment  in exchange for the   stock,” thus   qualifying for capital   gains   rather   than ordinary   income   treatment, if the   conditions   contained in any   one   of  the four paragraphs of subsection (b)  are   met.   In  addition to paragraph (1)’s “not   essentially   equivalent to a dividend” test, capital   gains   treatment is available   where (2)   the   taxpayer’s   voting   strength is substantially  diminished, [or]  (3)  his interest   in  the  company is completely   terminated.  ***   [T]axpayer   admits   that   paragraphs   (2)   and   (3)   do   not   apply.  231

--- Page 302 ---

232   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Moreover,   taxpayer   agrees   that   for the   purposes   of §§ 302(b)(2)   and   (3)  the attribution   rules   of § 318(a)   apply and   he is considered   to own   the   750 outstanding   shares   of common   stock   held   by   his   wife   and   children   in addition   to the   250   shares   in his own   name.  Taxpayer,   however,   argues   that   the   attribution   rules   do not   apply in considering   whether a distribution   is essentially   equivalent   to a dividend  under   § 302(b)(1).   According   to taxpayer,   he should   thus   be considered   to  own   only   25   percent   of   the   corporation’s   common   stock,   and   the  distribution   would   then   qualify under   § 302(b)(1)   since   it was   not pro rata  or   proportionate   to his   stock   interest,   the   fundamental   test   of dividend equivalency.   See   Treas.Reg.   1.302—2(b).   However,   the   plain   language   of the   statute   compels   rejection   of the   argument.   In subsection (c) of §   302,  the attribution   rules   are made   specifically   applicable   “in determining   the ownership   of stock   for purposes   of this   section.”   Applying   this   language,  both   courts   below   held   that   § 318(a)   applies   to   all   of   § 302,   including  § 302(b)(1)—a   view   in   accord   with   the   decisions   of the   other   courts   of  appeals,   a   longstanding   treasury   regulation,   and   the   opinion   of   the leading   commentators.7 Against this weight of authority, taxpayer argues that   the   result under paragraph (1) should be different because there is no   explicit  reference to stock ownership as there is in paragraphs (2) and (3). Neither that fact, however, nor the purpose   and history of § 302(b)(1) support  taxpayer's argument.   The attribution rules—designed to provide a clear answer to what   would otherwise be a difficult tax question—formed part  of the   tax bill that was subsequently enacted as the 1954 Code. As is  discussed further, infra, the bill as passed by the House of Representatives   contained no provision comparable to § 302(b)(1). When that provision was added in the Senate, no purpose   was   evidenced to  restrict the   applicability of § 318(a). Rather, the attribution rules  continued to be made specifically applicable to the   entire   section, and we  believe   that Congress   intended that they be taken into account wherever  ownership of stock was relevant.  Indeed, it was   necessary that   the   attribution rules apply to § 302(b)(1) unless   they   were to be effectively eliminated   from  consideration   with   regard to §§  302(b)(2) and (8) also. For if a transaction  failed to qualify under one of those   sections   solely because of the attribution rules, it would   according to taxpayer’s argument nonetheless qualify under § 302(b)(1). We cannot   agree   that Congress   intended so to nullify its explicit   directive. We conclude,   therefore,   that   the   attribution  res  of § 318(a) do apply; and, for the purposes of deciding whether a  istribution is “not   essentially   equivalent to   a dividend”   under  § 302(b)(1), taxpayer   must be deemed the owner of all 1,000   shares of  the  company’s common stock. 6 See   Treas.Reg.   1.302—2(b).  7 See   B.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 233  II  After   application   of the   stock   ownership   attribution   rules,   this   case  viewed   most   simply   involves   a   sole   stockholder   who   causes   part   of his  shares   to   be   redeemed   by   the   corporation.   We   conclude   that   such   a redemption   is always   “essentially   equi   LV]   ”   within   the  meaning   of that phrase in § 302(b)(1)8   and   therefore   do   not   reach   the  Government’s   alternative   argument   that   in   any   event   the   distribution  should   not   on   the facts   of this case   qualify   for capital   gains   treatment.9 The   predecessor   of § 302(b)(1)   came   into   the   tax   law   as   § 201(d)   of  the   Revenue   Act   of 1921,   42   Stat.   228:  “A stock   dividend   shall   not   be subject   to tax but   if after   the  distribution   of any   such   dividend   the   corporation   proceeds   to  cancel   or   redeem   its stock   at such   time   and   in such   manner   as  to   make   the   distribution   and   cancellation   or   redemption  essentially   equivalent   to the   distribution   of a taxable   dividend,  the   amount   received   in redemption   or   cancellation   of the   stock  shall   be treated   as   a taxable   dividend   * * * .”  Enacted   in   response   to   this   Court’s   decision   that   pro   rata   stock  dividends   do not constitute   taxable   income,   Eisner   v. Macomber,   252   U.S.  189   (1920),   the   provision   had   the   obvious   purpose   of   preventing   a corporation   from   avoiding   dividend   tax   treatment   by   distributing earnings   to   its   shareholders   in   two   transactions—a   pro   rata   stock  dividend   followed   by a pro   rata   redemption—that   would   have   the   same  economic   consequences   as   a   simple   dividend.   Congress,   however,   soon  recognized   that   even   without   a prior stock   dividend   essentially   the   same result   could   be   effected   whereby   any   corporation,   “especially   one   which has   only   a few   stockholders,   might   be   able   to make a distribution   to its stockholders   which   would   have   the   same   effect   as   a   taxable   dividend.”  H.R.Rep.   No.   1, 69th   Cong.,   1st   Sess.,   5. In order   to cover   this   situation,  the   law   was   amended   to apply   “(whether   or not   such   stock   was   issued   as a   stock   dividend)”   whenever   a   distribution   in redemption   of stock   was  made   “at   such   time   and   in   such   manner”   that   it   was   essentially equivalent   to a taxable   dividend.   Revenue   Act   of 1926,   § 201(g),   44   Stat.  el   This   provision of the 1926   Act   was carried forward in each  subsequent   revenue act and finally became   § 115(g)(1)   of  the   Internal  Revenue   Code of  1939. Unfortunately,   however, the  policies encompassed within the general   language of § 115(g)(1) and its predecessors   were not  clear, and there   resulted much confusion in  the   tax   law. At first, courts  8 Ofcourse, this  just means that a distribution in redemption to  a sole shareholder will be treated   under the   general   provisions of § 301, and it will only be  taxed as   a dividend   under  § 316 to the   extent   that   there are earnings   and profits.  9 The   Government argues   that   even if business   purpose   were   relevant   under   § 302(b)(1), the   business   purpose   present   here   related   only to  the   original   investment   and   not at  all  to the necessity   for redemption.   Under   either   view,   taxpayer   does   not   lose   his  basis in the   preferred stock.   Under   Treas.Reg.   1.302—2(c)   that   basis   is  applied   to  taxpayer’s   common stock.

234  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  assumed   that   the   provision   was   aimed   at   tax   avoidance   schemes   and  sought   only to determine   whether   such   a scheme   existed.   * * * Although later   the   emphasis   changed   and   the   focus   was   more   on   the   effect   of the  distribution,   many   courts   continued   to find   that   distributions   otherwise like   a   dividend   were   not   “essentially   equivalent”   if, for   example,   they were   motivated   by   a   sufficiently   strong   nontax   business   purpose.   See  cases   cited   n.   2, supra.   There   was   general   disagreement,   however,   about  what   would   qualify   as   such   a purpose,   and   the   result   was   a case-by-case determination   with   each   case   decided   “on the basis   of the particular   facts  of the transaction   in question.”   Bains   v. United   States,   289   F.2d   644,   646,  153   Ct.Cl.   599,   603   (1961).  By the time   of the general   revision   resulting   in the Internal   Revenue Code   of   1954,   the   draftsmen   were   faced   with   what   has   aptly   been described   as   “the   morass   created   by the   decisions.”   Ballenger   v.   United States,   301   F.2d   192,   196   (C.A.4th   Cir.1962).   In   an   effort   to   eliminate “the   considerable   confusion   which   exists   in   this   area”   and   thereby   to  facilitate   tax   planning,   H.R.Rep.   No.   1337,   83d   Cong.,   2d   Sess.,   35,   the  authors   of the   new   Code   sought   to provide   objective   tests   to   govern   the tax   consequences   of stock   redemptions.   Thus,   the   tax   bill passed   by the  House   of   Representatives   contained   no   “essentially   equivalent”  language.   Rather,   it   provided   for   “safe   harbors”   where   capital   gains treatment   would   be   accorded   to   corporate   redemptions   that   met   the  conditions   now   found   in §§ 302(b)(2)   and   (3) of the   Code.  It was in the Senate   Finance   Committee’s consideration of the tax bill that § 302(b)(1) was added, and   Congress   thereby   provided that capital gains treatment should be   available “if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend.” Taxpayer argues that   the purpose was to continue “existing   law,” and there is support in the   legislative history   that § 302(b)(1) reverted “in part” or “in general” to the “essentially equivalent”   provision of § 115(g)(1) of the 1939   Code.  According to the Government, even under the old law it would   have   been  improper for the Court of Appeals to rely  on   “a business   purpose for the redemption”   and “an absence of the proscribed tax avoidance   purpose to  bail out dividends at favorable tax   rates.” * * * However, we   need not decide   that   question, for we find from the   history of the 1954   revisions  and the purpose of § 302(b)(1)   that Congress   intended   more   than   merely to re-enact   the   prior   law.  In explaining the reason for adding the  “essentially   equivalent” test,  the Senate Committee stated   that   the House provisions “appeared unnecessarily restrictive, particularly,   in   the   case   of redemptions of  preferred   stock which   might be   called by the corporation   without the  shareholder   having   any control   over when the redemption   may take place.” S.Rep.   No.   1622,   83d   Cong.,   2d Sess.,   44. This   explanation   gives no   indication   that   the   purpose   behind   the redemption   should affect   the result. Rather,   in its more   detailed   technical   evaluation   of § 302(b)(1),   the  Senate   Committee   reported as   follows:

--- Page 305 ---

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS   235  “The   test   intended   to be incorporated   in the   interpretation of paragraph   (1) is in   general   that   currently   employed   under  section   115(g)(1)   of   the   1939   Code.   Your   committee   further  intends   that   in applying   this test for the future   * * * the inquiry will   be   devoted   solely   to   the   question   of whether   or   not   the transaction   by   its   nature   may   properly   be   characterized   as   a sale   of stock   by the   redeeming   shareholder   to the   corporation.  For this purpose   the presence   or absence   of earnings   and   profits of   the   corporation   is   not   material.   Example:   X,   the   sole  shareholder   of   a   corporation   having   no   earnings   or   profits  causes   the corporation   to redeem   half of its stock.   Paragraph   (1) does   not   apply   to such   redemption   notwithstanding   the   absence  of earnings   and   profits.”   S.Rep.   No.   1622,   supra,   at 234.  The   intended   scope   of   § 302(b)(1)   as   revealed   by   this   legislative history   is   certainly   not   free   from   doubt.   However,   we   agree   with   the Government   that   by making   the   sole   inquiry   relevant   for the   future   the  narrow   one   whether   the   redemption   could   be   characterized   as   a   sale,  Congress   was   apparently   rejecting   past   court   decisions   that   had   also considered   factors   indicating   the   presence   or   absence   of a tax-avoidance motive.   At   least   that   is the   implication   of the   example   given.   Congress clearly mandated   that pro rata   distributions   be treated   under   the general rules   laid   down   in §§ 301   and   316   rather   than   under   § 302,   and   nothing  suggests   that   there   should   be a different   result   if there   were   a “business  purpose”   for the redemption.   Indeed,   just the opposite   inference   must   be  drawn   since   there   would   not   likely   be   a   tax-avoidance   purpose   in   a  situation   where   there   were   no   earnings   or   profits.   We   conclude   that   the  Court   of Appeals   was   therefore   wrong   in looking   for a business   purpose  and   considering   it in deciding   whether   the redemption   was   equivalent   to a   dividend.   Rather,   we   agree   with   the   Court   of Appeals   for the   Second  Circuit   that   “the   business   purpose   of   a   transaction   is   irrelevant   in  determining dividend   equivalence”   under § 302(b)(1). Hasbrook v. United  States,   343   F.2d   811,   814   (1965).  Taxpayer strongly   argues that to treat   the redemption involved   here as essentially equivalent to  a dividend is to elevate form over substance. Thus,   taxpayer argues, had he not bought Bradley’s   shares or had he  made a subordinated loan to the company instead of buying preferred stock, he   could have gotten   back his $25,000   with   favorable tax  treatment. However, the   difference between form   and   substance in  the  tax law is largely   problematical,   and   taxpayer’s   complaints   have little to  _do  with whether a business   purpose is relevant   under   § 302(b)(1). It was clearly   proper for Congress to treat   distributions   generally as taxable dividends when   made out   of earnings   and profits and   then to prevent  avoidance of   that   result without   regard to motivation   where the  distribution is  in exchange for redeemed stock.  We   conclude   that   that   is what   Congress   did when   enacting  §  302(b)(1).   If a  corporation   distributes   property   as a simple   dividend,   the

--- Page 306 ---

236  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  effect   is to transfer   the   property   from   the   company   to its   shareholders without   a   change   in   the   relative   economic   interests   or   rights   of   the stockholders.   Where   a redemption   has   that   same   effect,   it cannot   be said to   have   satisfied   the   “not   essentially   equivalent   to   a   dividend” requirement   of § 302(b)(1).   Rather,   to   qualify   for   preferred   treatment  under   that   section,   a redemption   must   result   in a meani of the   shareholder’s   proportionate   interest   in   the   corporation.   Clearly,  taxpayer   here,   who   (after   application   of the   attribution   rules)   was   the sole shareholder   of the corporation   both   before   and   after the redemption, did not   qualify under   this test.   The   decision   of the   Court   of Appeals   must  therefore   be   reversed   and   the   case   remanded   to   the   District   Court   for dismissal   of the   complaint.  It is so   ordered.  a MR.   JUSTICE   DOUGLAS,   with   whom   THE   CHIEF   JUSTICE   and   MR.  JUSTICE   BRENNAN   concur,   dissenting.   ; I agree with the District Court, 274 F.Supp. 466, and with the Court of Appeals, 408   F.2d 1139,   that respondent’s   contribution of working  capital in the amount of $25,000 in exchange for 1,000 shares of preferred  stock with a par value of $25   was made in order for the corporation to  obtain a loan from the RFC and that   the preferred stock was to be  redeemed   when the loan was repaid. For the reasons stated by the two  lower courts, this redemption   was not “essentially   equivalent to a  dividend,” for the bona fide business purpose   of the red l elies the  “Although closely-held corporations call for close scrutiny under  the   tax   law, we will   not, under the facts and   circumstances of this   case, allow mechanical attribution rules to transform a  legitimate   corporate   transaction into a tax avoidance   scheme.”  408 F.2d, at 11438-1144.  When the Court holds it was a dividend, it effectively cancels  § 302(b)(1) from the Code.   This result is not a matter of conjecture, for  t says   that in the   case   of closely held or one-man corporations a  redemption of stock is “always”   equivalent to a dividend. I would leave such revision to the Congress.  Revenue Ruling   85-106  1985-2 Cum. Bull.  116.

FACTS  Corporation   X   had   outstanding   three   classes   of stock   consisting   of  100pe   eon   se   100   shares   of nonvoting   common   _  stock,   an   ee   ee   ee   ae eure   preferred   stock.  The   fair   market   value   of each   share   of common   stock   was   approximately half   the   fair   market   value   of each   share   of preferred stock. The   voting  common   stock   was   held   as follows:  Shareholders   Shares  A   19 B   19 :   C   18  Minority   shareholders   44  Total   100  None   of the   minority   shareholders   owned   more   than   five   shares.   None   of  the holders   of the voting   common   stock   were   related   within   the   meaning of section   318(a)   of the   Code.   The   combined   voting   power   of A, B, and   C was   sufficient   to elect   a majority   of the board   of directors   of X. The   nonvoting   common   stock   and   the _preferred—steck   were   held  (directly   and   indirectly)   in   approximately   the   s   roportion   e  common   stock.   C   held   no   nonvoting   common   stock   or   preferred   stock  directly,   but   was   the sole remaining   beneficiary   of a   trust(Z;) which owned 18 percent of both the nonvoting common   stock and the preferred stock.  “The trustees of 7 decided that it would be in the best interests of that  trust if most of the   X  preferred stock   held by T could   be converted into  cash. After   negotiation, X redeemed six shares of preferred stock for its fair market value of 6x dollars. Following this redemption, T continued to hold   three   shares of preferred stock, and 18 percent of  the nonvoting  common stock. Under section   318(a)(3)(B) of   the Code, T is also considered to own the voting common stock owned   by its sole beneficiary,  es LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Section   302(a)   of  the Code provides, in   part,   that if  a corporation ~redeems its stock, and if section   302(b)(1), (2),   (3),  or   (4) applies, such  redemption will be   treated as   a distribution in  part or   full payment in  exchange for  the   stock.  KKK  The   lack   of   any   reduction   in   7’s   18   percent   vote   prevented this redemption   from   qualifying   under   section   302(b)(2)   of the   Code,   and   the

--- Page 308 ---

238  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  lack   of complete   termination   of interest   prevented   it from   qualifying  under   section   302(b)(3).   The   question   remains   whether   the   redemption  should   be   considered   not   essentially   equivalent   to   a   dividend   so   as   to  qualify   under   section   302(b)(1).   Under   section   1.302—2(b)   of the   Income  Tax   Regulations,   this   determination   depends   upon   the   facts   and  circumstances   of each   case.  In United States v. Davis, 397 U.S.   301   (1970),   1970-1   C.B.   62, the  Supreme   Court   of the   United   States   held   that   in order   to   qualify   under section   302(b)(1)   of the   Code,   a redemption   must   result   in a meaningful  reduction   of the   shareholder’s   proportionate   interest   in the   corporation,  and   that,   for this   purpose,   the   attribution   rules   of section   318 apply.   —  In determining   whether   a reduction   in interest   is “meaningful”,   the rights   inherent   in a shareholder’s   interest   must   be examined.   The   three  elements   of a   shareholder’s   interest   that   are   generally   considered   most significant   are:   (1) the   right   to vote   and   thereby   exercise   control;   (2) the right to participate   in current   earnings   and   accumulated   surplus;   and   (3)  the   right   to share   in net   assets   on   liquidation,   Rev.Rul.   81-289,   1981-2  Ch er  In applying the above principles, it is significant   that (as a result of  section 318(a)(3)(B) of the Code) the redemption did   not reduce 7’s  percentage of the   vote in X. It   is true   that T reduced its percentage  interest in current   earnings, accumulated surplus, and net   assets upon  liquidation, and   reduced the fair market value of its ownership in   X. However, when the redeemed shareholder has a voting interest (either directly or by attribution), a reduction in voting power is  a key factor   in  determining the   applicability of section   302(b)(1) of the Code.  It is also true   that T was not the   largest shareholder. A and B each held slightly larger voting interests, and larger   interests measured by fair market value.   T, however,   was not   in the   position of a minority shareholder isolated from   corporate management and control. Compare  Rev.Rul.   75-512, where the majority of the redeeming corporation’s voting stock was held by a shareholder   unrelated (within   the meaning of  section   318(a)) to the redeemed trust. Also compare Rev.Rul.   76-385,  1976—2 C.B. 92, where the redeemed shareholder’s total interest was de  minimis.  In the present situation, a significant   aspect of 7’s failure to reduce voting power is the fact that   the redemption leaves unchanged 7’s  potential   (by  attribution from   C) for participating in a control group   by  acting in concert   with A and B. Compare Reyv.Rul. 76-364,   1976-2 C.B. 91, where a reduction in voting   interest was   found   meaningful in itself when it caused the redeemed   shareholder to give   up a potential for  control by  acting   in  concert   with   one   other   shareholder.   In addition,   the  Tax   Court   has   indicated   significance for   this   factor   of  potential   group control (Johnson Trust,   at   947).   See   also   Bloch v. United   States,   261  F.Supp.   597, 611-612   (S.D.Tex.1966), aff'd  per   curiam,   386   F.2d   839   (5th  Cir.1967),   where,   in   finding   that   “the   distributions   in   question   were

--- Page 309 ---

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 239  essentially equivalent to a dividend,” the   court noted that there was no change in the redeemed shareholder’s potential for exercising control “by  aligning himself with one or more of the other stockholders.”  Although   there   was   a   reduction   of 7’s   economic   interest   in X,   such  Ee auchon keynoksurnciently lageteFesull-im ameaninenil reduction of T’s   interest.   The absence   of any   reduction   of 7’s voting   interest   in X  (through C) and   7’s   potential   (through   C) for control   group   participation  are   compelling   factors   in this   situation.  In   Himmel   v.   Commissioner,   338   F.2d   815   (2d   Cir.1964),   dealing with   a   similar   question,   a   decision   was   reached   permitting   the applicability   of section   302(b)(1)   of the   Code.   That   case,   however,   was decided   prior   to   the   decision   of   the   Supreme   Court   in   Davis.   Thus,  Himmel   fails   to   reflect   the   development   in the   law   represented   by the  Davis   limitation   on   section   302(b)(1)   applicability   where   there   is   no meaningful   reduction   of the   shareholder’s   proportionate   interest   in the corporation.   Thus,   pursuant   to   Davis,   it is proper   to   view   Himmel   as  incorrect   to   the   extent   it conflicts   with   the   position   contained   in   this  revenue   ruling.  HOLDING  The   redemption   of nonvoting   preferred   stock   held   by   7’ does   not  qualify   as   a   redemption   under   section   302(b)(1)   of the   Code,   under   the  facts   of this ruling when   there   is no   reduction   in the percentage   of votin  and   nonvoting   common   stock   owned   by 7, and   when   7' continues   to have  an undiminished opportunity to-act inConcert with other shareholders as_  a   ee   a   the   redemption   does   not   otherwise   qualify   under  section   302(b),   it is not   a distribution   in part or full payment   for the stock  under   section   302(a).   Consequently,   under   section   302(d), the redemption will be treated   as   a distribution   of property   to which   section   301   applies.  NOTE  The Meaningful Reduction   Standard. In interpreting the “meaningful reduction” standard of Davis, the  Service’s rulings have   considered the effect  of  the redemption on the redeemed shareholder’s   voting   power, rights to participate in current and future   corporate   earnings, and rights to share in  net   assets   on   liquidation.57 As illustrated by  Revenue Ruling   85-106, if the  shareholder has a voting interest,   the key factor   in measuring dividend equivalence is the reduction in  the shareholder’s   voting power as opposed to other important   economic rights. Whether such a reduction is “meaningful” is essentially a question of fact, but some guidelines   have emerged from  “published   rulings-For   example; in Revenue   Ruling   75—502,58   the   Service  ruled   that a shareholder’s   reduction of voting common   stock  ownership   from  57  percent to 50  percent   was   meaningful   where the remaining stock  was   held  by a single   unrelated   shareholder.   The   ruling   also   states   that a lesser  57 See, e.g., Rev.   Rul.   81-289,   1981-2   C.B.   82.  58 10  75=9   CB.   11s

240  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  reduction   would   not   have   qualified   under   Section   302(b)(1)   because   the  shareholder   would   have   continued   to have   “dominant   voting   rights.”®9  Turning   to minority   shareholders,   the   Service   held   in Revenue   Ruling 75-5126   that a reduction   of common   stock   ownership   from   30 percent   to 24.3  percent—a   near-miss   under   the   substantially   disproportionate   redemption  safe   harbor—was   meaningful   because   the   redeemed   shareholder  experienced   a   reduction in three   signific   i   -   voting,   earnings,   and  assets   on   liquidation.   reduction   in   common   stock   ownership   from 27  percent   to 22 percent also was   held   to be meaningful   where   the   remaining  shares   were   owned   by three   unrelated   shareholders   because   the redeemed  shareholder   lost   the   ability   to   control   the   corporation   in   concert   with   only  one   other   shareholder.64   ~ CSS soma hia  The   Section   302   regulations   also focus   upon   the   effect   of the redemption  upon   the   shareholder’s   control   of   corporate   affairs.   Thus,   pro   rata  redemptions   of   a   corporation’s   single   class   of   stock   do   not   qualify   for  exchange   treatment,   and   the   redemption   of all of one’class   of   stock   also fails  if all outstanding   classes   of stock   are   held   proportionately.64Any   redemption of stock   from   a shareholder   owning   only nonvoting   preferred   stock,   however, is not   essentially   equivalent   a dividend   since   the   shareholder   does   not   have control   over   whether   the redemption   occurs.®   The   Service   also has ruled   that a redemption   of publicly   traded   common   stock   that   reduces   a shareholder’s  interest   from   .0001118   percent   to   .0001081   percent   qualifies   for   exchange  treatment   since   such   a   shareholder   cannot   exercise   control   over   corporate affairs.64   The   same   reasoning   should   apply   to   redemptions   by   closely   held companies   of   stock   held   by   minority   shareholders   who   reduce   their  percentage   interests,   éven   if   the   redtetion is   slight.   But   a   pro   rata redemption   of stock   in   a   publicly   traded   corporation   will   not   satisty-the  “meaningful   reduction”   standard   even if the shareholder   owns   only   small  noncontrolling interest in the   corporation.§§ Suppose that under state law a simple   majority of a corporation’s  outstanding shares can   control day-to-day   corporate activities through the  board of directors but extraordinary corporate action, such as a merger or  liquidation, requires approval by two-thirds of the   shares. Should a  redemption in which a shareholder loses control of extraordinary   corporate  action but retains   con   routi ers (e.g.   a reduction to o voting  control) qualify for exchange   treatment   under Section   302(b)(1)?

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 241  control of the corporation. In Revenue Ruling 78—401,87 the Service takes a  more restrictive view of the application of Section 302(b)(1) to these facts. The ruling concludes that if extraordinary corporate action is not  “amminent,” the retention of day-to-day   control of corporate activities is a  “predominant factor” and the redemption does not   result in a meaningful  reduction in the shareholder’s interest. It is unclear what position the  Service would take if a merger or similar corporate   transaction   were  contemplated or what evidence would substantiate the likelihood of corporate action.  Family   Discord.   One   of the more   titillating issues   to arise under   Section  302(b)(1) involves   whether   the   Section   318(a)(1)   family   attribution   rules  should   be   ignored   when   there   is   evidence   of family   discord   between   the redeemed   shareholder   and related   continuing   shareholders.   A typical factual  context   in which   this   “family   fight”   question   arises   is well   illustrated   in the  following   introduction   to a leading   Tax   Court   decision:§8 Petitioner   Michael   N.   Cerone   * **   and   his   son   Michael   L.  Cerone   * **   owned   and   operated   the   Stockade   Cafe   * **   each  owning   50   percent   of the   stock   of the   corporation.   The   father   and son   had   a   volatile   relationship   and   frequently   disagreed   over management   decisions.   Over   the years   their disagreements   became  more   serious,   and   finally   they   decided   one   of them   should   buy   the other’s   interest   in the   business.   Petitioner   did   not   think   he   could  run   the business   alone,   so it was   decided   that the corporation   would  redeem   all of his   stock.   After   the   redemption,   petitioner   worked   at the   Stockade   Cafe   for   several   years,   but   he   did   not   exercise   any  control   over   the   corporation.   This   case   involves   the   tax   treatment of the   payments   or   distributions   petitioner   received   for his stock. If the   family   attribution   rules   applied   to   the   above   fact   pattern,   the  redemption   of the   father’s   50 percent   stock   interest   would   not   qualify   under  Section   302(b)(1)   because   he   continued   to own   100   percent   of the   company  through   attribution   from   his   son.   If the   attribution   chain   could   be   broken,  however,   the father’s   reduction   of his interest   from   50 percent   to zero   would  be   “meaningful”   and   the   redemption   would   qualify   for exchange   treatment  under   Section   302(b)(1)   even   if he   failed   to   meet   the   specific   requirements for waiver   of family   attribution   under   Section   302(c).9  After its victory in United States v. Davis,   the   Service   consistently  rejected attempts   by  taxpayers to break the chain of family   attribution by  proving  family hostility.”° Most courts to consider the question   agree   that the  67   1978-2   C.B.   127.  68 Cerone v. Commissioner, 87  T.C.   1  (1986). See also  the  colorful introduction to the  Fifth  Circuit’s opinion in David   Metzger Trust v.

242   2 TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART  attribution rules apply without   regard to family   squabbles. Although the  First Circuit once held that family discord might “negate the presumption  of the attribution rules,7! the Tax Court and the Fifth Circuit have refused  to allow family discord to nullify the attribution rules in applying Section  302(b)(1).72  More   recently,   the   Tax   Court   has   suggested   that   family   discord   may   be  relevant   in testing for dividend   equivalency   under   Section   302(b)(1)   after the  attribution   rules   have   been   applied.   In Cerone   v.   Commissioner,’   the   court summarized   its view   of the proper   role of family   hostility:74 Although   we   [have]   rejected   the   * * *   argument   that   family  discord   could   preclude   application   of   the   attribution   rules,   we nonetheless   noted   that   family   discord   does   have   a   role,   albeit   a  limited   one,   in   testing   for   dividend   equivalence   under   section  302(b)(1).   We   reasoned   that   under   United   States   v.   Davis,   supra, the   proper   analysis   is as   follows:   First,   the   attribution   rules   are  plainly   and   straightforwardly   applied.   Second,   a   determination   is made   whether   there   has   been   a   reduction   in   the   stockholder’s  proportionate   interest   in the   corporation.   If not,   the   inquiry   ends because,   if there   is no   change   in the stockholder’s   interest,   dividend equivalency   results.   If there   has been   a reduction,   then   all the facts  and   circumstances   must   be   examined   to   see   if the   reduction   was  meaningful   under   United   States   v. Davis,   supra.   It is at this   point,  and   only   then,   that   family   hostility   becomes   an   appropriate   factor for consideration.   * * * .

For example,   suppose there is a redemption of all the shares of one class   of stock, but the shareholder is treated as receiving a Section   301   distribution because she continues to own shares in another class   of the corporation’s   stock? Or what if the shareholder actually owns no stock in the corporation after the redemption but is treated  as receiving a Section   301   distribution because shares   held by a family  member are attributed to her and the  technical requirements of a waiver of family   attribution were not   satisfied? What should happen to the basis of the redeemed shares in these fact patterns?  Historically,   the regulations   resolved this technical teaser—known as the “mystery of the disappearing basis”—by first permitting   any remaining  basis in the redeemed   shares to move to any other   shares in  the   corp   ion _—_   A0>0>   ss  7 Haft   Trust v.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS   243  held by the shareholder.’ In   the situation where the shareholder actually  owns no shares in the corporation following a redemption treated as a  Section 301 distribution, the regulations permit the   basis in the redeemed shares to “levitate” and move to stock held by family members or entities  whose   stock was   attributed   to   fhe redeemed   shareholder   under   Section   318.76  Regulations   proposed in 2009,   and   later withdrawn,   provided   a different  solution   to the   mystery   of the   disappearing   basis.   The   primary   goal of those  regulations   was   to combat   abusive   transactions   (well beyond   the scope   of our coverage)   that   exploit   the   current   rules   by   shifting   basis   from   a   foreign shareholder   not   subject   to U.S.   tax   to an   affiliated   U.S.   corporation   that   can benefit   from   the   additional   basis   to increase   loss   or reduce   taxable   gain.   To  that   end,   the   proposed   regulations   prevented   a redeemed   shareholder   from  transferring   any   unrecovered   basis   to another   class of stock   or to shares   held by a related   taxpayer   by requiring   the unrecovered   basis   to remain   with   the redeemed   shareholder.   The   redeemed   shareholder   was   allowed   to treat   the  Fe   ee   er   ata e disposition of the redeemed   stock later on  the   date   when   the   conditions   for   exchange   treatment   under   Sections 302(b)(1),   (2) or   (3) are   met   (e.g.,   when   a related   party   no   longer   owns   any  stock),   or,   alternatively,   when   all   shares   of the   issuing   corporation   (or its  successor)   become   worthless   withiri   the   meaning   of   Section   165(g).77   As noted,   those   regulations   were   withdrawn   and   the IRS   continues   to study   the  issue.78   When,   or if, the   Service   provides   additional   guidance,   the mystery   of  the   disappearing   basis   may   become   less of a NESE   oN ee 7 oN   Sls  C   D  PROBLEMS   AA   ne   23   24.  1.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  The   general   language   of the   proposed   draft   would   include  within   the   definition   of a   partial   liquidation   the   type   of cases involving   the   contraction   of the   corporate   business.   Such   as   for  example,   cases   which   hold   that   if the   entire   floor   of a factory   is  destroyed   by   fire,   the   insurance   proceedS   received   may   be  distributed   pro rata   to thesharéholders without   the imposition  of a tax at the rates applicable to the distribution   of a dividend,  if the corporation   no longer continues   its operations   to   the same  extent   maintained   by the destroyed   facility. Voluntary   bona   fide  contraction   of the   corporate   business   may   of course also qualify  to   the   same   extent   as   under   existing   law.   In   addition   to   the  general   definition   of what   constitutes   a partial liquidation,   your  committee’s   bill   provides   a   rule   to   indicate   one   type   of  distribution   that   will   in   any   event   constitute   a _ partial liquidation.   Under   this   rule,   if a corporation   is engaged   in two or   more   active   businesses   which   has fsic]   been   carried   on   for at  least   5 years,   it may   distribute   the   assets   of either   one   of the  The   amorphous   corporate   contraction   doctrine   is a perilous   yardstick for the   tax   planner.   Recognizing   the need   for greater   certainty,   Congress  has   provided   a   safe   harbor   in   Section   302(e)(2),   which   assures   partial  liquidation   status   if the   distribution   consists of the assets   of a “qualified  trade   or   mess”   or   is attributable   to the   termination   of such   a trade   or  business,   and   immediately   after   the   distribution   the   corporation  ein   tecaiey Mnstilee” qunkniN “tide "or"businesa!

At first glance,   it might   seem   that   C corporation   shareholders   would welcome   their   eviction   from   the   partial   liquidation   safe   harbor   because  distributions   that otherwise   would   give rise to taxable   capital   gain would  become   dividends   sheltered   by   the   dividends   received   deduction.   But Congress   was   not   acting   in   a   spirit   of   generosity.   Rather,   it   was attempting   to   put   an   end   to   several   widely   publicized   acquisition  techniques   that   used   the partial   liquidation   as   a vehicle   for obtaining   the  best   of   all   tax   worlds:   a   stepped-up   basis   for   selected   assets   of   the  acquired   corporation   along   with   the   preservation   of   favorable   tax  attributes   (e.g.,   earnings   and   profits   deficits,   loss   and   credit   carryovers,  etc.)—all   at little or no   tax   cost.87  Congress   inflicted   further   punishment   on   corporate   shareholders when   it enacted   restrictions   to prevent   abuse   of the   dividends   received deduction.§§   Any amount   treated   as a dividend   to a corporate   shareholder  under   Section   301   is an   “extraordinary   dividend”   under   Section   1059   if it is   a   distribution   in   redemption   of   stock   which   is   part   of   a   partial liquidation   of the redeeming   corporation,   regardless   of the   shareholder’s  holding   period   or   the   size   of the   distribution.89   As   a result,   a corporate  shareholder   that   receives   a dividend   in a transaction   treated   as   a partial  liquidation   must   reduce   its   basis   in   the   stock   of   the   redeeming  corporation   by the   portion   of the   dividend   that   was   not   taxed   because   of the   dividends   received   deduction.9  84 See Rev.

Corporation   P owned   all of the   single   class   of outstanding   stock   of  Corporation   S for many   years,   during   which   time   each   had   been   engaged  in the   active   conduct   of a trade   or business.

Section   [302(e)(1)]   of the   Code   provides,   in part,   that   a distribution  will   be   treated   as   a   partial   liquidation   of   a   corporation   if it   is   not  essentially   equivalent   to a dividend,   is in redemption   of a part of the stock of the   corporation   pursuant   to a plan,   and   occurs   within   the taxable   year in   which   the   plan   is   adopted   or   within   the   succeeding   taxable   year.  Section   1.346—1(a)(2)   of the   Income   Tax   Regulations   provides   that   a distribution   resulting   from   a   genuine   contraction   of   the   corporate  business   is an   example   of a   distribution   that   will   qualify   as   a   partial  liquidation   under   section   [3802(e)(1)].

Rul.   75-223,   1975-1   C.B.   109,   provides   that when a   parent   corporation   liquidates   a   wholly   owned   subsidiary   and distributes   the   subsidiary’s   assets,   or the   proceeds   from   the   sale   of those  assets,   to   its   shareholders,   the   fact   that   the   distributions_were  attributable   to assets   used   by the   subsidiary   rather   than   directly   by the  parent   will   not   prevent   the distribution   from   qualifying as a “genuine  contraction   of the   corporate   business”   to the   parent   within   the   meaning  be   a   ee   .  of section   1.346—1(a)(2)   of   the   regulations.   The   basis   for   this   holding   1s  that   under   section   381   a parent   corporation   that   liquidates   a subsidiary under   section   332   (when   section   334(b)(1)   applies)   inherits   attributes   (for example,   earnings   and   profits)   of the   liquidated   subsidiary   so   that   after the   liquidation   of the   subsidiary   the   parent   is viewed   as   if it had   always operated   the business   of the   liquidated   subsidiary. However,   when a parent   corporation   distributes   the   stock   of its  subsidiary, as in Situation   3 of Rev.Rul.   75-223,   section   381   of  the Code does   not   apply to integrate   the   past   business   results   of  the   subsidiary  with   those   of   the   parent.   Therefore,   distribution   by   the   parent of  sidiary’s   stock   does   not   result   in  the   parent corporation   taking into sub account   the   past   operati   0   -   Thus,   there 1s no analogy  between   a distribution   of   stock of the subsidiary   and a distribution   of the  247

248 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  assets of a liquidated subsidiary or the proceeds of a sale of such assets.  A distribution of the   stock of the subsidiary under such circumstances 1s a corporate separation, governed   by section   355, and not a corporate contraction. Similarly, as in the present case, where P sells all of the   stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, S,_and distributes   the proceeds to its shareholders, there is no basis for attributing the business activities   of S  to P. It  is well cstablishad thats corporation is a legal entity separate”  and distinct from its shareholders. New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292  U.S. 435 (1934), XIII-1 C.B. 194 (1934); Moline Properties, Inc. v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436 (1943), 1943 C.B.   1011. Although the   assets  of P are reduced by the subsequent distribution of the sale proceeds, the  sale by P of the S stock is not in and of itself sufficient to effect a~  contraction of the business operations of P within the contemplation of  economic significance of the sale of an investment and distribution of the  proceeds.  Accordingly,   the distribution   by P to its shareholders   of the proceeds of the   sale   of the   S   stock   does   not   qualify   as   a   distribution   in   partial  liquidation within the meaning of section [302(e)(1)] of the Code, and the  distribution will be treated as a distribution   by P of property   taxable   to  the   P   shareholders   under   section   301   by   reason   of section   302(d).   See  section   1.302—2(b)   of   the   regulations,   which   provides   that   all  distributions   in pro rata   redemption   of a part of the stock   of a corporation  generally   will   be   treated   as   distributions   under   section   301   if   the fz corporation   has   only one class   of stock outstanding.  tech Fomelo rs “PROBLEM  \ y   eG Al orporation   operates a book   publishing   business (“Books”) and a Be Po bug bar exam review course   (“Cram”) as divisions (1.e., not as separately  “Ud hem) ae pen a  incorporated entities).

In   the preceding chapter, the   story of the   decline of the General Utilities doctrine began to unfold.91 The assault on General Utilities in  the redemption setting gained momentum when Congress discovered that   several insurance companies were redeeming large amounts of their own stock by distributing appreciated securities while   avoiding recognition of gain at the corporate level.9? Congress curtailed this abuse  by Ae SS  IO eR ee   CE  appreciated property in a redemption as  if the propert had   been sold for  its fair market value.   Partial   liquidation   distributions, however,  continuéd to qualify for nonrecognition at the   corporate   level, and  numerous exceptions demonstrated that Congress   was not   yet ready to  give General Utilities   a proper   burial.%  Corporate   takeover specialists were   quick to exploit  these remaining  vestiges   of  the   General Utilities   doctrine.

The final demise of General Utilities in the redemption context came with the  Tax Reform Act of 1986. In adopting Section 311(b), which also applies to nonliquidating distributions, Congress repealed all the remaining  exceptions that had provided for nonrecognition of gain to the  distributing   corporation. As a result, a corporation distributing property in redemption of stock (including a delat Harta eioaale aee oceans gal   may   not   recognize   loss.  Ch  2.   EFFECT   ON KARNINGS AND   PROFITS  Code:   § 312(n)(7).  The   effect   of a   stock   redemption   on   the   distributing   corporation’s earnings   and   profits   initially   depends   upon   the   tax   consequences   of the redemption   at   the   shareholder   level.   If the   redemption   is treated   as   a  distribution   to   which   Section   301   applies,   the   distributing   corporation  adjusts   its   earnings   and   profits   in   the   same   manner   as   on   other nonliquidating   distributions—i.e.,   earnings   and   profits   are   decreased   by the   amount   of cash   and   the   principal   amount   of any   obligations,   and   by the greater   of the adjusted   basis   or the fair market   value   of any   property distributed.%   In   addition,   the   corporation   always   recognizes   gain   and  correspondingly   increases   its   current   earnings   and   profits   on   a distribution   of appreciated   property,   and   it reduces   current   earnings   and profits by any   taxes   paid on   that   gain. If a redemption (including a partial liquidation) is treated as an  exchange to the redeemed shareholder, the effect on earnings   and profits  is more   complex. In   that   situation, Section   312(n)(7) provides that   the part of istribution in redemption_that_ i le   to  earnin   ount which does not exceed the attri outable tothe redeemed   stock. For purposes of Section 312(n)(7),  accumulated earnings   and profits include any   current   earnings   and  profits available at the time of the redemption.   The current   earnings   and  profits available at that   time are determined after they first have   been  applied to characterize as dividends   any   Section   301   distributions made  during the   year.   If the corporation is unable to show the   actual   current earnings   and profits as of   the   date   of   the redemption,   then   current  earnings   and profits   are allocated to the  date   of  distribution   on a pro  rata  94 See Henderson,   “Federal   Tax   Techniques for Asset Redeployment Transactions,”   37 Tax   L.Rev.   325   (1982).

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  basis.°7 Congress also expressed its intention that earnings   and profits never would be reduced by more than the amount of the redemption.98 _  To   illustrate   the   operation   of this   rule,   assume   that   X   Corporation  has   1,000   shares   of common   stock   outstanding,   and   that   A   and   B   each  acquire   500 of these shares   at issuance   at   a   price   of $20 per share.  Assume   further   that   X is a profitable   business   that   holds   $100,000   of net  assets,   consisting   of   $50,000   cash   and   $50,000   of   appreciated   real  property,   and   X   has   $50,000   of accumulated   earnings   and   profits. If X  distributes   $50,000   cash   to A   in redemption   of A’s   500   shares,   Section  312(n)(7)   reduces   X’s earnings   and   profits   by $25,000—the   ratable   share  of X’s_   $50,00   ributable   to   A’s 50   percent   stock interest   that was   redeemed.   The   remaining   $25,000   of the distribution   is  charged   to X’s   capital   account   and,   after   the   redemption,   X has   $25,000  .   .   SS   ES Le   ee   .   o   a ——_—_  of remaining   accumulated   earnings   and   profits.   The   following   excerpt  from   the   legislative   history   of the   Tax   Reform   Act   of 1984   explains   the  operation   of this   rule   in the   case   of a   corporation   with   a   more   complex  capital   structure:99  If   a   corporation   has   more   than   one   class   of   stock  outstanding,   its   earnings   and   profits   generally   should   be allocated   among   the different   classes   in determining   the amount by   which   a   redemption   of all   or   a   part   of one   class   of stock reduces   earnings   and   profits.   However,   earnings   and   profits  generally   should   not be allocated   to   referred   stock which is not  Seer bIe- neat which slcesuct participate £0   anysignificant  extent   in   corporate   growth.   Therefore,   a   redemption   of such  preferred_stock   should   result   in   a   reduction   _o   ital  account   only,   unless   the   distribution   includes   dividend arrearages,   which   will reduce   earnings   and   profits.  Similarly, priorities   legally required as between different  classes   of stock should be taken into account in allocating  earnings   and profits between classes. For example, assume that corporation X has   1,000   shares of class A common stock and  1,000   shares of  class   B common stock. Both classes are $10 par  value stock and   were   issued at the same time at a price   of  $20. The class A common has a preference _as to dividends and  liquidating   distributions in a 2:1  ratio to the class B common,  and only  the  class   B common has   voting rights. Assume further that Corporation X holds   net   assets worth   $210,000   and   has  current   and   accumulated earnings   and profits  of $120,000. If X  a   distributes   $140,000   in   cash in redemption   of all of the class A  a  97 Rev.   Rul. 74-338,   1974-2 C.B.   101; Baker v.

Amounts   paid to acquire   stock   generally   must   be capitalized   as   part  of   the   stock’s   basis.1°°   The   capitalization   requirement   applies   to   the  original   purchase   price   of the   stock   as   well   as   to   acquisition   expenses,  such   as   brokerage   commissions   and   legal   fees.191   Some   older   authority  held,   however,   that   expenses   incurred   by a corporation   to repurchase   its stock,   in   limited   circumstances,   might   be   ordinary   and   necessary  expenses   deductible   under   Section   162.102   In the   midst   of the   frenzy   of  hostile   corporate   takeovers   in   the   1980s,   Congress   became   concerned  that   corporate   expenditures   incurred   to   fend   off   unwanted   corporate suitors   by   purchasing   their   shares—so-called   “greenmail”   payments—  were   being   characterized   as   deductible   business   expenses.193_   Section 162(k)(1)   was   enacted   to   make   it   clear   that   all   expenditures   by   a  corporation   incurred   in reacquiring   its own   stock,   whether   representing amounts   paid for the stock,   a premium   paid in excess   of the stock’s   value,  or   expenses   connected   with   the   purchase,   are   nondeductible,  nonamortizable   capital   expenditures.1°4   Section   162(k)(2)   contains  exceptions   for   interest   payments   deductible   under   Section   168,   and  several   more   specialized   situations.  One difficult interpretive problem   under the Section   162(k) disallowance rule revolves around the question of what   amounts are paid  to shareholders “in connection   with” a redemption of   stock. The legislative history   states   that   while   the phrase “in connection   with” is  to  be construed   broadly, it  is not intended to deny a deduction for “otherwise deductible amounts paid in a transaction   which   has no nexus   with   the 100   T.R.C. §§ 263(a), 1012.  101 Reg.  § 1.263(a)—4(c), (e).

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 253  redemption other than   being proximate in time or arising out of the same circumstances.”!05 The   Conference Report goes on to expand upon this  standard: 106  For   example,   if   a   corporation   redeems   a   departing  employee’s   stock   and   makes   a   payment   to   the   employee   in  discharge   of the corporation’s   obligations   under   an   employment contract,   the payment   in discharge   of the contractual   obligation is not   subject   to disallowance   under   this provision.   Payments   in  discharge   of other   types   of contractual   obligations,   in settlement  of   litigation,   or   pursuant   to   other   actual   or   potential   legal obligations   or   rights,   may   also   be outside   the   intended   scope   of  the   provision   to   the   extent   it is   clearly   established   that   the payment   does   not   represent   consideration   for   the   stock   or  expenses   related   to its acquisition,   and   is not   a payment   that   is  a fundamental   part   of a “standstill”   or   similar   agreement.  The   conferees   anticipate   that,   where   a   transaction   is not directly   related   to   a redemption   but   is proximate   in time,   the  Internal   Revenue   Service   will   scrutinize   the   transaction   to  determine   whether   the   amount   purportedly   paid   in   the  transaction   is   reasonable.   Thus,   even   where   the   parties   have  countervailing   tax   interests,   the parties’   stated   allocation   of the  total   consideration   between   the   redemption   and   the   unrelated transaction   will   be   respected   only   if it is supported   by   all the facts   and   circumstances. However,   the   conferees   intend   that   agreements   to refrain  from   purchasing   stock   of a corporation   or   other   similar   types   of  “standstill”   agreements   in all events   will be   considered   related to   any   redemption   of the   payee’s   stock.   Accordingly,   payments  pursuant   to   such   agreements   are   nondeductible   under   this  provision   provided   there   is an   actual   purchase   of all or   part   of the   payee’s   stock.   The   conferees   intend   no   inference   regarding the   deductibility   of   payments   under   standstill   or   similar agreements   that   are   unrelated   to   any   redemption   of   stock  owned   by the   payee.  105 H.R.

254  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  F. REDEMPTION PLANNING TECHNIQUES  1.   BOOTSTRAP   ACQUISITIONS  Revenue   Ruling   75-447  1975-2 Cum. Bull. 113.  Advice   has   been   requested   as   to   the   Federal   income   tax  consequences,   in the   situations   described   below,   of the   redemption   by a corporation   of part of its stock.  Situation   1  Corporation   X had   outstanding   100   shares   of voting   common   stock  of which   A   and   B   each   owned   50   shares.   In   order   to   bring   C   into   the  business   with   an   equal   stock   interest,   and   pursuant   to   an   integrated  plan,   A and   B   caused   X to issue,   at fair   market   value,   25   new   shares   of  voting   common   stock   to   C. Immediately   thereafter,   as   part   of the   same plan,   A   and   B   caused   X to redeem   25   shares   of X voting   common   stock from   each   of them.   Neither   A, B, nor   C owned   any   stock   of X indirectly  under   section   318   of the Internal   Revenue   Code   of 1954.  Situation   2  Corporation   X had   outstanding   100   shares   of voting   common   stock  of which   A   and.B   each   owned   50   shares.   In   order   to   bring   C into   the  business   with   an   equal   stock   interest,   and   pursuant   to   an   integrated  plan, A   and   B each   sold   15 shares   of X voting   common   stock   to C at fair market   value   and   then   caused   X to redeem   five   shares   from   both   A   and  B. Neither   A, B, nor   C owned   any   stock   of X indirectly   under   section   318  of the   Code.  Section   302(b)(2) of the Code states that   section   302(a), which provides for treating a redemption of stock as   a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock, will apply if the   distribution is  substantially   disproportionate   with   respect to the shareholder. *  *  *  In Zenz v. Quinlivan,   213   F.2d   914 (6th  Cir.1954), a sole shareholder  of a corporation,   desiring to dispose of her entire   interest   therein,   sold part of her   stock to   a competitor   and shortly   thereafter sold the  remainder of her   stock to the corporation for an amount of cash and property approximately equal to its earned surplus. The Government contended that   the redemption   was a dividend on   the grounds that   the  result was the same as   if the   steps had   been   reversed,   that is, as   if the stock had   been redeemed first and the  sale of  stock to the competitor   had followed. The   United States   Court of Appeals rejected   the Government’s contention   and   held   that   the purchase of  the   stock by the   corporation  (when   coupled   with   the  sale of  stock to the  competitor)   was not a dividend  to the   selling shareholder   and   that   the   proceeds   should   be   treated as payment for  the   stock   surrendered   under   the   provisions   of  the   Internal  Revenue   Code   of 1939.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  Rev.   Rul.   55-745,   1955-2   C.B.   223,   states   that   in situations   similar to   that   in   Zenz,   the   amount   received   by   the   shareholder   from   the  corporation   will   be   treated   as   received   in   payment   for   the   stock  surrendered   under   section   302(a)   of the   Code   since   the transaction   when  viewed   as   a whole   results   in the   shareholder   terminating   his interest   in  the   corporation   within   the   meaning   of section   302(b)(3).  In   determining   whether   the   “substantially   disproportionate”  provisions   of section   302(b)(2)   of the Code   have   been   satisfied   in Situation  1 and   in Situation   2, it is proper   to rely upon   the holding   in Zenz   that the  sequence   in which   the   events   (that   is, the   redemption   and   sale)   occur   is  irrelevant   as   long   as   both   events   are   clearly   part   of an   overall   plan.  Therefore,   in   situations   where   the   redemption   is   accompanied   by   an issuance   of new   stock   (as in Situation   1), or a sale of stock   (as in Situation  2), and   both   steps   (the sale,   or issuance,   of stock,   as   the   case   may   be, and  the   redemption)   are   clearly   part   of   an   integrated   plan   to   reduce   a  shareholder’s   interest,   effect   will   be   given   only   to the   overall   result   for  purposes   of section   302(b)(2)   and   the   sequence   in which   the   events   occur  will be disregarded. Since   the   Zenz   holding   requires   that   effect   be   given   only   to   the  overall   result   and   proscribes   the   fragmenting   of the   whole   transaction into   its   component   parts,   the   computation   of the   voting   stock   of the corporation   owned   by the shareholder   immediately   before the redemption  for purposes   of section   302(b)(2)(C)(ii)   of the   Code   should   be made   before any   part   of   the   transaction   occurs.   Likewise,   the   computation   of the  voting   stock   of the   corporation   owned   by   the   shareholder   immediately  after   the   redemption   for   purposes   of   section   302(b)(2)(C)@)   should   be made   after   the   whole   transaction   is   consummated.   Making   the  immediately   before   and   the   immediately   after   computations   in   this manner   properly   reflects   the extent   to which   the   shareholder   involved   in each   situation   actually   reduces   his stock   holdings   as a result   of the whole transaction. Therefore, for purposes of the computations required by section  302(b)(2)(C) of the Code, A and B, in Situation 1, will each   be viewed as  having owned 50 percent   (50/100   shares) of X before   the transaction   and  33% percent (25/75   shares) immediately thereafter.   In Situation 2, A and B will each   be viewed as having owned 50   percent   (50/100   shares) of X before   the transaction   and   33% percent (30/90   shares) immediately thereafter. Furthermore, in each situation,   the   result would be  the same  if the redemption   had   preceded the   issuance, or sale, of  stock.  Accordingly, in both   Situations 1 and 2, the requirements of  section  302(b)(2)   of  the Code are   satisfied. Therefore,   the amounts distributed to  A  and B in both   situations   are distributions   in full payment in exchange for  the   stock redeemed   pursuant to section   302(a).  255

PART   2 256 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS  NOTE  —  he classic bootstrap acquisition 18 _ a transaction Wit. ee,  purchases all  or part of the stock of the target corporation in conjunction   with  1 e_of the selling shareholder’s stock. In Zenz v.  Quinlivan,!°7 which is discussed in Revenue Ruling 75-447, the sole  shareholder of a corporation sold part of her stock for cash and, three weeks  later, the corporation redeemed her remaining shares. The combined sale and redemption structure was   used because the buyer wanted to minimize future dividend exposure by reducing the corporation’s earnings   and profits.  The seller’s agenda was to be taxed on both the sale and redemption at then favorable capital gains rates and avoid dividend treatment on the  redemption.  The   Service   argued   that   the redemption   would   have   been   a dividend   to  the target’s   shareholder   if the   distribution   had   preceded   the   sale   and   should  not   be   treated   any   differently   where   the   parties   orchestrated   a   different  order   of events.   The   Sixth   Circuit   disagreed.   Finding   that   the   taxpayer  intended   from   the   outset   to terminate   her   entire   interest   in the   corporation, it held   that   the redemption   qualified   as   an   exchange   rather   than   a dividend. The   Service   subsequently   acquiesced   to the   result   in Zenz   and   extended   its reasoning   to substantially   disproportionate   redemptions   in Revenue   Ruling  75-447.  In the case   of a noncorporate   shareholder,   Zenz   and   its progeny   have   far  less   significance   as   long   as   qualified   dividends   are   taxed   at   preferential capital   gains   rates.   In   a   combined   sale   and   redemption   transaction,   a  noncorporate   seller   ordinarily   will   suffer   no   tax   disadvantage   if   the  distribution   in redemption   is characterized   as   a   dividend.   The   distinction still   matters,   however,   to corporate   shareholders.   As   discussed   in   Chapter 4,1°8 corporate   sellers   who   are   seeking   to extract   liquid   assets   prior to a sale of   stock   normally   prefer   a   pre-sale   dividend   for   two   reasons:   (1)   the availability   of the   dividends   received   deduction,   and   (2)   corporate   capital gains   are   not   taxed   at preferential   rates.  PROBLEM  Strap is the sole shareholder of Target   Corporation.   Boot is a prospective buyer   and is willing to purchase all of the Target stock, but   Boot is unable to pay the $500,000 price demanded by Strap   even though he   believes it to be fair. Target   has  more   than   $100,000 of accumulated earnings   and profits and  $100,000 cash on hand.   Should   Strap   and   Boot   structure Boot’s acquisition  of Target   along the lines  of  the Zenz case? Is there a better   alternative? What  additional facts would you like   to know?

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL LIQUIDATIONS  2.   BUY-SELL   AGREEMENTS  a.   IN   GENERAL  Code:   §§ 101(a);   264(a)(1).   Skim   § 2703.  Closely   held   corporations   frequently   use   buy-sell   stock   purchase agreements   to ensure   continuity   of the business,   to satisfy economic   and  tax   goals   when   a shareholder   dies   or   retires,   and   to resolve   shareholder disputes.   There   are   two   basic   forms   of buy-sell   agreements.   Under   a  “cross-purchase”’   agreement,   the   departing   shareholder   or   the shareholder’s   estate   sells stock to the continuing   shareholders.   Under   the  more   commonly   employed   “entity-purchase”   agreement,   the   corporation redeems   the   departing   shareholder’s   stock,   funding   the redemption   with  available   cash,   borrowed   funds,   an   installment   note,   or   the   proceeds   of a  corporate-owned   life insurance   policy.   The   obligation   to buy   (or sell) may be mandatory   or optional,   as the parties   agree,   and is triggered by certain  events   specified   in the   agreement.   The   most   common   trigger   event   is a  shareholder’s   death.   Other   typical   trigger   events   are   retirement   or disability.  Buy-sell   provisions   frequently   are   part   of   a   more   comprehensive  shareholders’   agreement   that   includes   restrictions   on   the   transfer   of stock,   rights   of first refusal   to the corporation   in the   event   a shareholder wishes   to   sell,   and   provisions   to   determine   the   value   of   any   stock  purchased   pursuant   to   the   agreement.   Some   primitive   agreements   set the   price   based   on   “book   value,”   an   accounting   concept   that   often   bears little   or   no   relationship   to   the   economic   value   of the   company.   More sophisticated   agreements   will use   a formula   based   on   earnings   or provide for an   appraisal   mechanism   on   the   occurrence   of a trigger   event.  A goal of many buy-sell agreements for closely-held family  businesses is to establish   the   federal   estate   tax valuation of the   stock  upon a shareholder’s death. A decedent’s gross   estate generally   includes all property held by the decedent,   valued either at the   date of death or six months thereafter (the alternate   valuation date).109 In   the   case   of unlisted stock, which cannot be valued by market quotations, fair market value is determined   by taking into account a variety of  factors, including the   corporation’s net worth, its earnings history and   dividend-paying capacity, and the value of  stock   of publicly   traded companies in the same  line  of business.120 If stock is subject to an   option or contract to purchase,  such as a buy-sell agreement, the regulations   provide that the agreement  will establish   the  value if  it represents a bona fide business arrangement “and is not a device to pass   the   stock to the   natural objects   of   the decedent’s   bounty for less than   adequate   and full consideration.141   But if  109   LR.C. §§ 2031; 2032.  10   T.R.C.   § 2031(b);   Reg.   § 20.2031—2(f)(2).   See   also   Rev.   Rul.   59-60,   1959-1   C.B.   237. 11   Reg.   §  20.2031-2(h).   For   the   buy-sell   agreement   price   to   be   binding,   the  decedent’s  estate   must   be obligated   to sell  the   decedent’s'   stock;   the  buyer   either   must   be obligated   to  buy  257

258  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  the decedent   was free to dispose of the   stock during his lifetime without price  restrictions, “little weight” is given to the price set   at death by the  option or contract.1!2 The courts agree that maintaining control of a  closely held business constitutes a bona fide business purpose but they  require a separate examination of whether a restriction or option constitutes a “testamentary device.”113  For buy-sell   agreements   entered   into or substantially   modified   after October   8, 1990,   Congress   has   added   some   statutory   restrictions   on   the  valuation   of property   subject to an   option   or contract   to purchase.   Section 2703(a)   provides   that   the   value   of   any   property   for   estate,   gift   and  generation-skipping   tax   purposes   shall   be   determined   without   regard   to  (1) any   option,   agreement   or   other   right   to   acquire   or   use   property   at   a  price   less   than   the   fair   market   value   of the   property,   disregarding   the option   agreement   or right,   or   (2) any   restriction   on   the   right to sell or use  such   property.   Under   this general   rule, the effect of a buy-sell   agreement  on   valuation   would   be   disregarded.   Section   2703(b),   however,   provides  an   exception   for   any   option,   agreement,   right   or   restriction   which  satisfies   the   standards   of   the   regulations   (bona   fide   business arrangement   and   not   a testamentary   device)   and   has   terms   “comparable  to   similar   arrangements   entered   into   by   persons   in   an   arm’s   length  transaction.”   In adding   this   comparability   standard,   Congress   intended the   taxpayer   to show   that   the   agreement   was   one   that   could   have   been  obtained   in an   arm’s   length bargain   with   an   unrelated   party,   considering  such   factors   as   the   term   of   the   agreement,   the   present   value   of   the  affected   property,   and   its   expected   value   at   the   time   of exercise.114   In noting   that   this   standard   would   not   be   met   “by   showing   isolated comparables   but   requires   a   demonstration   of   the   general   practice   of  unrelated   parties,”   the   Senate   Finance   Committee   stated   that   expert  testimony—e.g.,   by   an   appraiser   familiar   with   the   industry—would   be evidence   of such   general   practice.115  Drafters of buy-sell agreements still have   some flexibility   in   their use   of valuation   methodologies. For example, the   legislative history of Section 2703 states that a buy-sell agreement should not be disregarded  merely   because its terms differ from those used by   another similarly situated company.116   Noting that general   business practice may  recognize more   than one valuation methodology, even   within the same  industry,   the   conferees went on to state that “fiJn such situations,   one   of  x  the decedent's interest or have an option to do so: and the   price   specified must   have   been fair  at  the  time   the agreement was   made.

CHAPTER   5   REDEMPTIONS   AND   PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  several   generally   accepted   methodologies   may   satisfy   the   standard contained   in the conference   agreement.”!17 Section   2703   has   not   resulted   in the   demise   of buy-sell   agreements to   fix   estate   tax   valuation.   It merely   places   a   greater   premium   on   an  evidentiary   showing   that   the   arrangement   is bona   fide and   not   merely   a  tax-avoidance   device   to transfer   a family   business   to the next   generation for less than   adequate   and   full consideration. As   developed   in the next   section   of the text, buy-sell   agreements   also  may   raise   constructive   dividend   issues   if they are   not properly   structured  and   implemented.   With   most   dividends   now   taxed   at   15   or   20   percent,  these   issues   may   or   may   not   be important   depending   on   other   variables,  such   as the shareholder’s   stock basis,   the need   for capital   gains to absorb  otherwise   unavailable   capital   losses,   and   the   shareholder’s   other   tax  characteristics.  b.   CONSTRUCTIVE   DIVIDEND   ISSUES  Revenue   Ruling   69-608  1969-2   Cum.   Bull.   42.  Advice   has   been   requested   as   to   the   treatment   for   Federal   income tax   purposes   of   the   redemption   by   a   corporation   of   a   retiring shareholder’s   stock   where   the   remaining   shareholder   of the   corporation has   entered   into   a contract   to purchase   such   stock. Where   the   stock   of a corporation   is held   by a small   group   of people,  it is often   considered   necessary   to   the   continuity   of the   corporation   to  have   the individuals   enter   into agreements   among   themselves   to provide for   the   disposition   of the   stock   of the   corporation   in   the   event   of the resignation,   death,   or   incapacity   of one   of them.   Such   agreements   are generally   reciprocal   among   the shareholders   and   usually   provide   that on  the resignation,   death,   or incapacity   of one   of the principal   shareholders,  the   remaining   shareholders   will   purchase   his   stock.   Frequently   such  agreements   are   assigned   to the corporation   by the remaining   shareholder  and   the   corporation   actually   redeems   its   stock   from   the   retiring  shareholder.  Where a corporation redeems stock from a retiring shareholder, the fact that   the corporation in purchasing the shares satisfies the continuing   shareholder’s   executory   contractual   obligation to purchase  the redeemed shares   does   not   result   in a distribution to the continuing  ~shareholder   provided that the continuing   shareholder is not  subject to an existing primary   and   unconditional   obligation to perform the   contract and that   the   corporation   pays   no more   than fair market   value for   the  stock redeemed.  117 Id.  See   also   Reg.   §  25.2703—1(b)(4).  259

260  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  On the other hand, if the continuing shareholder, at the time of the  assignment to the corporation of his contract to purchase the   retiring shareholder’s stock, is subject to an unconditional obligation to purchase the retiring shareholder’s stock, the satisfaction by the corporation of his  obligation results in a constructive distribution to him. The constructive  distribution is taxable as   a distribution under section 301 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  If the   continuing   shareholder   assigns   his   stock   purchase   contract   to the   redeeming   corporation   prior   to   the   time   when   he   incurs   a   primary  and   unconditional   obligation   to   pay   for   the   shares   of   stock,   no  distribution   to   him   will   result.   If, on   the   other   hand,   the   assignment  takes   place   after   the   time   when   the   continuing   shareholder   is   so obligated,   a   distribution   to   him   will   result.   While   a   pre-existing  obligation   to perform   in the future   is a necessary   element   in establishing a   distribution   in   this   type   of case,   it is not   until   the   obligor’s   duty   to perform   becomes   unconditional   that   it   can   be   said   a   primary   and  unconditional   obligation   arises.  The   application   of the   above   principles   may   be   illustrated   by   the situations   described   below.  Situation   1  A and B are unrelated individuals who own all of the outstanding  stock of corporation X. A and B enter into an agreement that provides in  the event B leaves   the employ of X, he will sell his X stock to A at a price fixed by the agreement.   The agreement provides that within a specified  number of days of B’s offer   to sell, A will purchase at the   price   fixed by the agreement all of the X stock owned by B. B terminates his employment and tenders the X  stock to A. Instead of purchasing the stock  himself in accordance with the terms of the agreement, A causes X to  assume the contract and to redeem its stock   held by B. In this  case, A had a primary   and   unconditional obligation to perform his contract with B at  the time the  contract was   assigned to X. Therefore, the redemption   by X  of its stock held by B will result in a constructive   distribution to A. See William J. and   Georgia K. Sullivan v. United States of America, 244  F.Supp.   605 (1965), affirmed,   363   F.2d   724 (1966),   certiorari denied,   387  U.S.   905,   87 S.Ct. 1683 (1967), rehearing denied,   388 U.S.   924,   87 S.Ct.  2104 (1967).  Situation   2  A and B are unrelated   individuals who   own all of the outstanding stock   of corporation X. An   agreement   between   them provides unconditionally that  within   ninety   days of  the death of  either A or B,  the  survivor will purchase the   decedent’s   stock   of X from his   estate.  Following the   death of  B, A causes X to assume the   contract   and   redeem  the   stock   from B’s   estate.  The   assignment of the  contract to X followed   by  the redemption   by  X  of the   stock   owned   by  B’s   estate   will  result   in  a constructive   distribution

CHAPTER   5   REDEMPTIONS   AND   PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS   261  to   A   because   immediately   on   the   death   of   B,   A   had   a   primary   and  unconditional   obligation   to perform   the   contract.  Situation   8  All   of the   stock   of X corporation   was   owned   by a   trust   that   was   to  terminate   in   1968.   Individuals   A   and   B   were   the   beneficiaries   of the  trust.   Since   B was   the   trustee   of the trust,   he had   exclusive   management  authority   over   X through   his control   of the board   of directors.   In   1966,   A paid   to B   the   sum   of 25x   dollars   and   promised   to pay   an   additional   20x dollars   to B   in   1969   for B’s   interest   in the   corpus   and   accumulations   of the   trust   plus B’s   agreement   to resign   immediately   as   supervisor   of the  trust   and   release   his   control   over   the   management   of the   corporation.  The   actual   transfer   of   the   stock   held   in   trust   was   to   take   place   on  termination   of the   trust   in   1968.   In   1969,   X   reimbursed   A   for   the   25x  dollars   previously   paid   to   B,   paid   20x   dollars   to B,   and   received   the   X stock   held   by B. For   all practical   purposes,   A became   the owner   of B’s shares   in 1966.  Although   naked   legal title to the shares   could not be transferred   until the trust   terminated   in 1968,   B did transfer   all of his beneficial   and   equitable ownership   of the X stock   to A in exchange   for an   immediate   payment   by A   of 25x   dollars   and   an   unconditional   promise   to pay   an   additional   20x dollars   upon   termination   of the trust.   The   payment   by X of 20x   dollars   to  B   and   25x   dollars   to A in   1969   constituted   a constructive   distribution   to  A   in   the   amount   of   45x   dollars.   See   Schalk   Chemical   Company   v.  Commissioner,   32 T.C.   879   (1959),   affirmed   304   F.2d   48   (1962).  Situation   4  A and B   owned all of the outstanding stock of X corporation. A and  B entered into a contract under which, if B desired to sell his X stock, A  agreed to purchase the   stock or to cause   such stock to be purchased. If B chose to sell his X stock to any   person other than A, he could   do so at any time.   In accordance with the terms of the   contract,   A caused X to redeem  all of B’s stock in X.  At the time of  the redemption, B was free to sell his stock to A or to  any other   person, and A had no unconditional obligation to purchase the stock and no   fixed liability to pay for the stock. Accordingly, the redemption   by X did   not   result   in a constructive   distribution to A. See  S.K. Ames, Inc. v. Commissioner, 46   B.T.A.   1020 (1942), acquiescence,  C.B. 1942-1, 1.  Situation   5  A and B   owned all of  the outstanding stock   of X corporation. An  agreement   between   A   and B provided that upon the   death of either, X will redeem all of  the X stock owned   by the   decedent at  the   time of his  death.   In   the   event   that X does   not redeem the   shares   from   the   estate,  the agreement   provided   that   the   surviving   shareholder   would   purchase  the   unredeemed   shares   from   the   decedent’s   estate. B   died   and,   in

262  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  accordance with the agreement, X redeemed all of the shares owned by  his estate.  In this case A was only secondarily liable under the agreement  between A and B. Since A was not primarily obligated to purchase the X  stock from the   estate of B, he  received no constructive distribution when .  X redeemed the stock.  Situation   6  B   owned   all   of   the   outstanding   stock   of X   corporation.   A   and   B entered   into   an   agreement   under   which   A   was   to purchase   all of the   X stock   from   B. A   did   not   contemplate   purchasing   the   X   stock   in his   own name.   Therefore,   the contract   between   A and B specifically   provided   that  it could   be   assigned   by A   to   a   corporation   and   that,   if the   corporation  agreed   to be bound   by the terms,   A would   be released   from   the   contract.  A organized   Y corporation   and   assigned   the   stock   purchase   contract to it.   Y borrowed   funds   and   purchased   all of the X stock   from   B pursuant  to the agreement.   Subsequently   Y was   merged   into X and   X assumed   the  liabilities   that   Y incurred   in connection   with   the   purchase   of the   X stock and   subsequently   satisfied   these   liabilities. The   purchase   by Y of the   stock   of X did   not   result   in a constructive distribution   to A.   Since   A   did   not   contemplate   purchasing   the   X   stock   in his own   name,   he   provided   in the   contract   that   it could   be   assigned   to a corporation   prior   to the   closing   date.   A   chose   this   latter   alternative   and assigned   the   contract   to   Y.   A   was   not   personally   subject   to   an  unconditional   obligation   to purchase   the   X   stock   from   B.   See   Arthur   J.  Kobacker   and   Sara   Jo   Kobacker,   et   al.   v.   Commissioner,   37   T.C.   882  (1962),   acquiescence,   C.B.   1964   2,   6.   Compare   Ray   Edenfield   v. Commissioner,   19 T.C.   18   (1952),   acquiescence,   C.B.   1953-1,   4.  Situation   7  A and B   owned all of the outstanding stock of X corporation. An agreement   between the shareholders   provided that upon the death of either, the survivor would   purchase the decedent’s   shares from his estate at a price provided in the agreement.   Subsequently, the agreement was  rescinded   and a new   agreement entered into which   provided that upon  the death of either A or B, X would   redeem all of the decedent’s   shares of  X stock from his estate.  The cancellation of the original   contract between the  parties in favor  of  the new contract   did not   result   in a constructive   distribution to either A or B. At the time X agreed to purchase the   stock pursuant to the terms of  the new   agreement, neither A nor B had an unconditional   obligation to purchase   shares of X stock. The   subsequent   redemption of  the   stock  from the  estate  of  either pursuant to the terms of  the new   agreement will  not   constitute a constructive   distribution to the   surviving   shareholder.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  PROBLEM A, B and   C, who   are   unrelated,   each   own   1,000   shares   of common   stock  (the only class outstanding)   of X Corporation   with   a fair market   value   of $400  per   share.   X   has   $600,000   of   accumulated   and   no   current   earnings   and  profits.   A and   C each   have   a $50,000   adjusted   basis   in their   X stock.   B, who recently   received   her   stock   as   an   inheritance,   has   a $400,000   adjusted   basis.  B wishes   to retire   and   dispose   of her   stock.  What   are the tax consequences   of the following   alternative   transactions:  (a)   Pursuant   to a cross-purchase   buy-sell   agreement,   B   sells   500  shares   each   to A   and C for $200,000   each.  (b)   Pursuant   to an   entity-purchase   buy-sell   agreement,   X redeems  all of B’s   stock   for   $400,000.  (c)   Same   as   (a), above,   except   the   agreement   required   A   and C to  buy   B’s   stock   over   ten   years,   with   appropriate   interest,   but they   did   not   have   sufficient   funds   to   make   the   payments   so  they   caused   X to make   them   on   their   behalf. (d)   A   and   C had   options   to buy   B’s   stock   when B   retired   but   they  were   short   of funds   and   allowed   X to redeem   the   stock   instead.  (e)   The   parties   previously   entered   into   a_   cross-purchase agreement   under   which   they   agreed   that   the   two   surviving shareholders   would   purchase   the   X stock   owned   by the   estate of the   first   shareholder   to   die.   X   purchased   a   life   insurance policy   on   the   life   of   each   shareholder   and   paid   the   annual premiums.   X is the   beneficiary   under   the   policies.   B died   this  year,   and   X   used   the   proceeds   from   the   policy   on   B’s   life to  completely   redeem   the   stock   held   by B’s estate.  c.   REDEMPTIONS   INCIDENT   TO   DIVORCE  Regulations:   § 1.1041—2(a)—(d).  Arnes   v.   United   States  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Ninth   Circuit,   1992.  981   F.2d   456.  a   HUG,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE:  The issue   in   this   case is whether a taxpayer   must recognize for  income tax purposes the   gain   that   she   realized when,   pursuant to   a  divorce   settlement, a corporation redeemed her   half   of  the   stock   in  the  ~corporation,   the remaining stock   of which   was owned   by her   former  husband.   The district   court,   ruling   on cross-motions for summary judgment, held   that   Section   1041 of  the   Internal Revenue   Code of 1986 (L.R.C.)   relieved   the   taxpayer of having to recognize   the   gain, and  awarded the  taxpayer a refund   of  $53,053 for  1988. * * * We affirm.  263

264  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  i,  Joann Arnes, the Taxpayer-Appellee,   married   John   Arnes in 1970. In   1980, they formed a corporation, “Moriah,” to operate a McDonald’s  franchise in Ellensburg, Washington. That corporation issued   5,000  shares of stock in the joint names of John   Arnes   and Joann Arnes. In 1987,   the couple agreed to divorce. McDonald’s Corporation required  100%   ownership of the equity and profits by the owner/operator, and informed   John   Arnes that there should be no   joint ownership of the restaurant after the divorce.  Joann   and   John   Arnes   entered   into   an   agreement   to   have   their  corporation   redeem   Joann   Arnes’   50 percent   interest   in the   outstanding stock for $450,000.   The   corporation   would   pay   that money   to   Joann   Arnes  by   forgiving   a   debt   of   approximately   $110,000   that   she   owed   the corporation,   by making   two   payments   of $25,000   to her   during   1988,   and  by paying   the   remainder   of approximately   $290,000   to   her   in   monthly  installments   over   ten   years   beginning   in February   1988.   The   agreement  was   incorporated   into   the   decree   of dissolution   of the   marriage,   dated January   7,   1988.   Joann   Arnes   surrendered   her   2,500   shares   to   the  corporation   on   December   31,   1987,   and   the   corporation   cancelled   her  stock   certificate   on   May   4,   1988,   then   issuing   another   2,500   shares   to  John   Arnes.  On her federal income tax return for 1988, Joann   Arnes reported  that she sold her stock in Moriah on January 2, 1988, for a price of  $450,000, and that her basis was $2,500, resulting in a profit of $447,500.  She received $178,042 in 1988 as part of the sales price. Using an  installment method, she   treated $177,045 as long-term capital gain and  the remainder as recovery of a portion of her basis.  On   December 27, 1989,   she filed a timely   claim for refund of $53,053  for 1988 on the ground that   she was not required to recognize   any   gain  on the  transfer of her   stock because the  transfer was made pursuant toa  divorce instrument.   The   IRS did   not allow   the claim for refund, and  Joann   Arnes initiated this suit. The district court found that   the redemption of Joann Arnes’ stock  in Moriah was   required by a divorce instrument,   and that John   Arnes had benefitted from the transaction   because it was part of the marital property   settlement, which limited   future community property   claims that Joann Arnes   might   have   brought against   him. The court,   in applying the IRS regulations, found that, although   Joann   transferred   her   stock directly to Moriah, the   transfer was made on behalf of John   and   should  have   been   treated as having   been made to John.   Therefore,   the   transfer qualified for nonrecognition of gain  pursuant to the   I.R.C. exemption for  transfers made to spouses or former   spouses   incident to   a divorce  settlement.   See 26 U.S.C. § 1041   (1988). Summary   judgment   was   granted in favor   of   Joann   Arnes.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  The   Government   appeals.   Meanwhile,   in   order   to   insure   that   the  capital   gain   will   be   taxed,   the   Government   has   asserted   a   protective  income   tax   deficiency   against   John   Arnes,   who   has   contested   the  deficiency   by filing a petition   with   the Tax   Court.   His   case   is pending   but  not   before   this   court.   The   Government   maintains   that,   although   Joann Arnes   is the appropriate   party   to be taxed   for the gain,   John Arnes   should  be taxed   if the   district   court’s   ruling is upheld.   If neither   John nor   Joann  is   taxed,   the   $450,000   used   to   redeem   Joann’s   appreciated   stock  apparently   will be taken   out   of the corporation   tax-free.  ***  III.  The   Government   contends   that   the   gain   resulting   from   Moriah’s  redemption   of Joann   Arnes’   stock   does   not   qualify   for   exemption   under section   1041,   which   is limited   to transfers   made   directly   to one’s   spouse  or   former   spouse,   or   transfers   made   into   trust   for   that   person.   Joann  Arnes’   transfer   to Moriah,   the   Government   contends,   is outside   the   scope  of the   exemption.   Joann   Arnes   contends   that   her   transfer   of stock   to  Moriah   should   be considered   a transfer   to John,   resulting   in a benefit   to  John,   and   absolving   her   of the   obligation   to   bear   the   burden   of   any resulting   tax.  *K*K*  The   purpose   of   [Section   1041]   is to   defer   the   tax   consequences   of transfers   between   spouses   or   former   spouses.   See   H.R.Rep.   No.   432,   Pt. II, 98th   Cong.,   2d Sess.   1491   (1984),   reprinted   in 1984   U.S.Code   Cong.   &  Admin.News   697,   1134   (“a husband   and wife are   a single economic   unit”). Property   received   in such a transfer   is excluded   from   the recipient’s   gross  income.   The   recipient’s   basis   is then   equal   to the   transferor’s   basis.   26 U.S.C.   § 1041(b)(2)   (1988).   Later,   when   the   recipient   transfers   the property   to a third   party,   the   gain or loss must   be recognized. After   section 1041   was enacted, the Treasury Department published a temporary regulation to implement the statute. Temp. Treas.   Reg. § 1.1041-1T (1992). The regulation   explains that in certain   cases a  transfer of property to   a third party “on behalf of’   a spouse or former  spouse   should be treated as a transfer to the spouse or former spouse. Id. at Q-9,   A-9. One   example supplied in the regulation is the   case where  the   transfer to the   third party is required   by a divorce or separation  instrument.   Such a transfer of property will be treated as made directly to the nontransferring   spouse (or former   spouse)   and the nontransferring “spouse will be   treated as immediately transferring   the property to the  third   party. The   deemed transfer   from the nontransferring   spouse (or  former   spouse) to the   third   party is not a transaction   that   qualifies   for nonrecognition of  gain   under   section   1041. Temp.   Treas.Reg.   §  1.1041-  1T, A-9 (1992).  The   example   suggests   that   the   tax   consequences   of  any   gain or  loss arising   from   the   transaction   would   fall  upon   the  nontransferring   spouse  265

--- Page 336 ---

266 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS ) PART 2  for whose benefit   the transfer was made, rather than upon the  transferring spouse. Consistent with the  policy of the statute, which is to defer recognition until the property is conveyed to   a party outside the marital unit, the regulation seems to provide for shifting the tax burden  from one spouse to the   other, where appropriate.  Thus,   a   transfer   by   a   spouse   to   a   third   party   can   be   treated   as   a transfer   to the   other   spouse   when   it is “on   behalf   of’ the   other   spouse. Whether   the   redemption   of Joann’s   stock   can   be construed   as   a transfer to John,   pursuant   to the   regulation   example   in A-9,   depends   upon   the  meaning   of “on behalf of.” The   district court   interpreted   the regulation   as  meaning   that   a   transfer   was   made   “on   behalf   of’   John   Arnes   if he  received   a benefit   from   the transfer.   The   court   then   concluded   that   John  did   receive   a   benefit,   because   the   transfer   was   part   of   the   marital property   agreement   which   settled   any   future   community   property   claims  that Joann   Arnes   could   have   asserted   against   John.  Although   no   case   is   directly   on   point,   many   tax   cases   concern transfers   made   on   behalf   of   other   persons.   Generally,   a   transfer   is  considered   to have   been   made   “on   behalf   of’   someone   if it satisfied   an obligation   or a liability of that   person.   If an   employer   pays   an   employee’s income   tax,   that   payment   is income   to   the   employee.   See   Old   Colony  Trust   Co.   v.   Commissioner,   279   U.S.   716,   729-31,   49   S.Ct.   499,   504,   73  L.Ed.   918   (1929).   If a corporation   assumes   a shareholder’s   bank   note   in  exchange   for   stock,   the   shareholder   receives   a   taxable   constructive  dividend.   Schroeder   v.   Commissioner,   831   F.2d   856,   859   (9th   Cir.1987).  In Schroeder, the taxpayer borrowed money from a bank to buy stock  in the corporation. The corporation later redeemed part of that stock,  assumed the taxpayer’s bank note, and forgave a debt owed   by the  taxpayer to the corporation. At the time that   the taxpayer borrowed the money from the bank,   he owned no part of the corporation and   had no authority to act on behalf of the corporation.   See id. at 859-60 & n. 7. The  taxpayer   had the primary obligation to repay the loan, and the  corporation’s assumption of the   loan   relieved   the taxpayer of that obligation. We held   that   the redemption of Schroeder’s stock was a  taxable   constructive   dividend. Id. at 859. The Government argues that   the Arnes stock   transfer is more properly   analogized to Holsey v. Commissioner, 258   F.2d   865 (38d  Cir.1958), where the Third Circuit   held   that a shareholder who   owned fifty percent of  the stock ina   corporation did not  receive a taxable   benefit  when the corporation redeemed the   other fifty percent of the stock. The court found that the redemption “did  not discharge   any   obligation of [the  taxpayer]   and did   not   benefit him in any direct   sense,” although the  result was that the shareholder   gained   control   of  the company. Id.  at  868. John  Arnes   had an   obligation to Joann   Arnes that   was   relieved by Moriah’s   payment to Joann.   That   obligation   was   based in their   divorce  property   settlement,   which   called   for   the   redemption of  Joann’s   stock.  Although   John   and   Joann   were   the   sole   stockholders   in   Moriah,   the

--- Page 337 ---

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  obligation to purchase Joann’s stock was John’s, not Moriah’s. Furthermore, John personally guaranteed Moriah’s note to Joann. Under Washington law, Joann could sue John for payment without suing  Moriah. See Wash.Rev.Code Ann. § 62A.3—-416(1) (West 1979). Thus,  John was liable, with Moriah, for the payments due   Joann. We   hold   that   Joann’s   transfer   to   Moriah   did   relieve   John   of   an  obligation,   and   therefore   constituted   a benefit   to John.   Joann’s   transfer  of stock   should   be   treated   as   a   constructive   transfer   to John,   who   then  transferred   the   stock   to   Moriah.   The   $450,000   was   paid   to   Joann   by  Moriah   on   behalf   of John.   The   transfer   of $450,000   from   the   corporate  treasury   need   not   escape   taxation,   if we   hold,   as we   do, that   Joann   is not  required   to recognize   any   gain   on   the   transfer   of her   stock,   because   it is subject   to section   1041.   The   tax   result   for   Joann   is the   same   as if she had  conveyed   the property   directly   to John. The   Government   argues   that because   Joann   transferred   her stock   to the corporation,   rather   than   to John,   the exception   in section   1041   should  not   apply.   The   corporation   cancelled   Joann’s   stock   and   agreed   to   pay  Joann   $450,000.   As   a result,   no   asset   with   a carryover   basis   exists.   John  received   an   additional   2,500   shares   from   the   corporation   after   Joann’s  shares   were   cancelled,   but   he   did   not   carry   over   Joann’s   basis,   because  the   transfer   was   not   made   directly   to him.   Under   this   literal   application  of the statute,   Joann’s   gain, from   the appreciation   of the stock,   would   not be recognized   by John   if he   were   to dispose   of his   stock.   Although   John became   the   sole   owner   of the   corporation   as   a result   of the   transfer,   the  net   worth   of   the   corporation   was   depleted,   because   the   corporation  incurred   the   debt   of $450,000   to   Joann.   As the   Government   puts   it, before  the   stock   redemption,   John   owned   half of a corporation   worth   $900,000;  after the redemption,   he owned   all of a corporation   worth   $450,000.   John has   realized   no   gain;   the value   of his stock   is still in the corporation,   and the   redemption   did   not   increase   the   value   of John’s   stock.   In   contrast, Joann   received   cash   (and   debt   forgiveness)   for her   transfer   of stock. We reject the Government’s application of the statute. The regulations,   particularly as explained   by   Question   and Answer 9, in Temp. Treas.   Reg. § 1.1041-1T,   demonstrate that  the statute is meant to apply to situations   such as this   one, where a transfer is made on behalf  of one’s former spouse.  Finally,   the Government points to one   other example in   the Temporary Treasury   Regulations   interpreting section   1041. Question 2  describes a situation in which a corporation   wholly owned   by one spouse sells property to the   other   spouse. That sale is not   subject to the exemption rule of  section   1041.   See Temp. Treas.   Reg. § 1.1041-1T(a), Q—  2, A-2, ex. 3  (1992). The   example does   not   apply to the Arnes   transaction  because   Moriah   was   owned one-half   each   by John   and   Joann.  The   judgment of the   district   court   is AFFIRMED.  267

The   Ninth   Circuit   found that   the   disposition   of Mrs.   Arnes’   stock   was   not   a redemption   but   rather   a  sale   to Mr.   Arnes   in a tax-free   transaction   under   Section   1041.   What   then  are   the   tax   consequences   to   Mr.   Arnes,   who   was   not   a   party   to   the   case?  Assuming   that   Moriah   was   a   C   corporation   with   sufficient   earnings   and profits,   Mr.   Arnes   would   appear   to   have   a   $450,000   constructive   dividend  (taxable,   under   current   law,   at   a maximum   rate   of 20   percent   but   with   no  recovery   of   basis)   under   the   Ninth   Circuit’s   characterization   of   the transaction.   But   appearances   can   be   deceiving.   Mr.   Arnes   took   his controversy   to the   Tax   Court,   which   held   in a reviewed   decision   that   he   did not   have   a   constructive   dividend   because   he   was   not   primarily   and unconditionally   obligated   to acquire   his wife’s   stock.118   The   court   supported  its decision   with   the following   example   from   Revenue   Ruling   69-608:119 A and   B owned   all the   outstanding   stock   of X corporation.   An  agreement   between   A and B provided   that upon   the death   of either, X will redeem   all the X stock   owned   by the   decedent   at the   time   of death.   In   the   event   that   X   does   not   redeem   the   shares   from   the estate,   the   agreement   provided   that   the   surviving   shareholder would   purchase   the unredeemed   shares   from   the   decedent’s   estate.  B   died   and,   in accordance   with   the   agreement,   X   redeemed   all of the   shares   owned   by his estate.  In this case A was only secondarily liable under the agreement between A and B. Since A was not primarily obligated to purchase  the X stock from the   estate of B he received no constructive distribution when   X  redeemed the stock.  As a result, neither   Mr. nor Mrs. Arnes was taxable on the transaction—the  dreaded “whipsaw” result that   the Service was trying to avoid. Which result was   more favorable overall for the taxpayers—the Ninth Circuit’s or the Tax Court’s? Remember that it is usually desirable in a marital   dissolution   setting for the  parties to plan to reduce their   overall   tax lability. In a concurring   opinion in Arnes, Tax   Court Judge   Beghe offered this observation:120  Hewing to the bright line rules of Rev. Rul. 69-608 *  * * in the marital   dissolution   context will reduce the   tax   costs   of divorce for the owners of small   businesses held and operated in corporate form.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 269  terminating   shareholder,   the   overall   tax   costs   will   ordinarily   be  less   than   if the   terminating   spouse   qualifies   for   nonrecognition under   Section   1041,   but   the   remaining   spouse   suffers   a   dividend tax.   This   will   leave   a   bigger   pie   to   be   divided   in   setting   the consideration   for the   share   to be redeemed.  Confusion   in the Courts:   Inconsistent   Standards.   The   Ninth   Circuit   held  that   Mrs.   Arnes   was   not   taxable   under   Section   1041   because   her   transfer  was   “on   behalf   of’?   her   husband   within   the   meaning   of the   Section   1041 regulations.   But   the   Tax   Court   held   that   Mr.   Arnes   did   not   have   a constructive   dividend   because   the   corporation   did   not   satisfy   his   “primary  and   unconditional”   obligation   to acquire   his   wife’s   stock.   So   neither   spouse was   taxed   and   the   Service   was   whipsawed   because   different   standards   were  applied   to   the   transferor   and   nontransferor   spouse   to   determine   the   tax consequences   of the   same   transaction.  The   Tax   Court   revisited   this   issue,   but   its   multiple   and   conflicting  opinions   in Read   v.   Commissioner!2!   only   added   to the   confusion.   The   fact pattern   in Read   was   fairly typical.   Prior   to their   marital   dissolution,   Mr.   and Mrs.   Read   owned   virtually   all   the   stock   of   Mulberry   Motor   Parts,   Inc. (“MMP”),   a C corporation.   Mrs.   Read   (“W”)   agreed   to sell her   MMP   stock   to Mr.   Read   (“H”)   for cash   and   a promissory   note   bearing   market   rate   interest  unless   H   elected   to   cause   MMP   or   its   separate   employee   stock   ownership plan to buy the stock   on   the same   terms.   H elected   to have   MMP   redeem   W’s  stock.   Although   W   reported   the interest   paid by MMP   on the promissory   note  as   income,   neither   W   nor   H   reported   any   taxable   gain   on   the   redemption. Fearing   a whipsaw,   the   Service   issued   deficiency   notices   to both   parties.   But  it ultimately   aligned   itself with   W   by arguing   in the   Tax   Court   that   H   had  received   a   constructive   dividend   from   MMP   in   the   full   amount   of   the principal   and   interest   payments   received   by W. The   Tax   Court   majority   viewed   the   central   issue   to   be   whether   W’s transfer   of MMP   stock   to MMP   was   made   “on   behalf   of H”   so   that   W   was  entitled   to nonrecognition   of gain   under   the   Section   1041   regulations.!22   W argued   that   the   regulations   squarely   applied   to   her   situation,   while   H,  seeking   to   avoid   a constructive   dividend,   relied   on   established   case   law   in arguing   that   he   should   not   be   taxed   because   he   never   had   a “primary   and unconditional   obligation”   to purchase   W’s   stock.  The   Tax   Court   majority sided with W, holding for the first time that application of  the venerable   “primary   and   unconditional”   standard to the  nontransferor   spouse   was   inappropriate in divorce-related redemptions. Instead,   the majority   based its decision on   the   Section   1041   regulations in  holding that   W’s   transfer of MMP stock to MMP was a transfer made “on  _behalf of’? H. The court found that   H’s   election to have MMP redeem W’s  stock caused W to be   acting as H’s representative in connection   with   the redemption. In  light of  these   holdings,   the  majority   sustained the deficiencies  asserted   against   H, noting   that H   had   “indicated”   that   he  would   be taxable if the court   found   that W was   entitled to nonrecognition   under   Section   1041.  121   114 T.C.   14 (2000)  122   See   Reg.   § 1.1041-1T(c),   Q & A-9.

270   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Because   it found   H’s   “indication”   as   tantamount   to   a   concession,   the   Tax  Court   majority   offered   no   analysis   of the proper   standard   to be applied   to the nonredeeming   spouse.   As   discussed   earlier   in this   Note,   however,   the   Tax  Court   previously   had   applied   the   “primary   and   unconditional”   standard   in holding   that   a   nontransferor   spouse   does   not   invariably   receive   a  constructive   dividend   in a divorce-related   redemption.  Nine   judges   joined   the majority   opinion   in Read;   six of the   nine   wrote   a  concurring   opinion   with   more   extensive   analysis   of   the   unfavorable   tax consequences   to H. Seven judges   dissented   in four separate   opinions.   Despite differences   in emphasis,   the   essence   of the   dissents   was   that   the   majority should   not   have   discarded   the   “primary   and   unconditional”   standard   in the  divorce   setting.  Regulations   to the Rescue.   Reacting   to the   confusion   in the   courts,   the  Service   amended   the   Section   1041   regulations   to provide   greater   certainty in determining   the   tax   consequences   of divorce-related   redemptions.   Unlike the Tax   Court   majority   in Read,   the   regulations   seek   to harmonize   the   well recognized   “primary   and   unconditional   obligation”   standard   for constructive  dividends   with   the policy of Section   1041.  The threshold   question posed by the regulations is whether a divorce- related redemption results in a constructive distribution to the nontransferor  spouse under applicable tax   law. For this purpose,   “applicable tax law” means the primary and   unconditional obligation   standard.123 If the redemption does result in a constructive distribution,   the redeemed stock is deemed to have   been   transferred by the transferor spouse to the nontransferor   spouse in a tax-free Section   1041   transaction   (provided the requirements of Section   1041 are otherwise met), and then   retransferred by the nontransferor   spouse to the redeeming corporation.!24 The tax consequences of the deemed redemption are then determined   under Section  302.125 As a result, the transferor spouse   has no gain or loss on the deemed  transfer of stock to the nontransferor spouse, and the nontransferor   spouse  most likely has a constructive dividend.126  If the redemption does not   result in a constructive   distribution—e.g.,  because it does not   satisfy a primary and   unconditional obligation of the nontransferor spouse—the regulations respect   the form of the  transaction.127 That means that  the corporation is treated as having redeemed stock   directly from the transferor   spouse in a transaction in which the nontransferor spouse is not a party. As a result, Section   1041   does not apply,   the  transferor spouse’s   tax treatment is determined   under Section   302 (likely a capital gain), and the nontransferor   spouse is not   taxed.128  123 Reg. § 1.1041—2(a), (d) Examples 1 & 3.  124 Reg. § 1.1041—2(a)(2), —2(b)(2).  125 Reg. § 1.1041-2(b)(2). 126 Whether or not   the   constructive   distribution is a dividend   depends on whether the corporation   has   earnings   and profits and   whether   any of  the   tests   for exchange   treatment in Section   302 are met   (unlikely   in  the typical   fact pattern).  27 Reg. § 1.1041-2(a)(1).  128 Reg.   § 1.1041—2(b)(1).

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  The   regulations   provide   a   “special   rule”   permitting   spouses   to   depart  from   “applicable   tax   law”   and   treat   a   divorce-related   redemption   as   either taxable   to the   transferor   spouse   (even   if it would   have   been   a constructive  dividend   to   the   nontransferor   spouse   under   applicable   tax   law)   or   as   a constructive   distribution   to the   nontransferor   spouse   and   a tax-free   Section 1041   transfer   to the transferor   spouse   (even   in the   absence   of a primary   and unconditional   obligation).129   This   rule   is consistent   with   the   general   policy allowing   the   parties   to a divorce   to negotiate   and   ultimately   determine   the tax   consequences   of   divorce-related   transactions   (e.g.,   spousal   and   child  support   payments,   property   transfers,   dependency   exemptions)   as   long   as  they   treat   the   transactions   consistently.   To   utilize   the   special   rule,   the parties   must   memorialize   their   intent   in a   written   agreement   prior   to the date   on   which   the   nontransferor   spouse   files   his   or   her   first   timely   filed  federal   income   tax   return   for   the   year   that   includes   the   date   of the   stock  redemption   but   no   later   than   the   due   date   of   the   return   (including  extensions). 130  If the   regulations   had   applied   to the   redemption   in the Arnes   case   and the   parties   had   not   elected   to utilize   the   special   rule,   which   spouse   would  have   been   taxed?  Planning.   In   light   of   these   permissive   regulations,   how   should   the parties   plan   a   divorce-related   redemption?   For   example,   how   should   a  redemption   be   structured   if the   parties   wish   to minimize   their   overall   joint  tax liability and   preserve   more   dollars   for the family?   What   is the best advice  to   a   transferor   or   nontransferor   spouse   who   wishes   to   avoid   tax   on   the redemption?   In   what   circumstances   would   the   parties   wish   to   invoke   the “special   rule?”   Is it still possible,   either   through   separate   or joint planning, to structure   a redemption   so that neither   spouse   is taxed?   Do   the regulations eliminate   all legal   controversies   over   the   proper   tax   treatment   of divorce-  related   redemptions?  PROBLEM H   and   W,   a married   couple   on   the   verge   of divorce,   each   own   50   of the 100   outstanding   shares   of common   stock   (the   only   class   outstanding)   of  Family   Corp.   (“F’),   which   has a total   value   of $1   million   and   $500,000   of  accumulated   earnings   and   profits.   H and   W   each   have   a   $100,000   basis   in  their F stock.   H and W   have   agreed that on the effective   date   of their divorce,  H   will   own   all the   stock   of F and   W   will   receive   $500,000   for her   50   shares.  Consider   the tax consequences   of the following   proposals   to meet   these   goals:  (a) H buys   W’s stock for $500,000 cash. (b) Hand   W agree   that F will redeem W’s   stock for $500,000 cash.  (c) How would   you   advise   each of  the   parties to structure   the  transaction?  129   Reg.   § 1.1041—2(c).  130   Reg. § 1.1041—2(c)(3).  271

272   ART   2 TAXATION   OF C CORPORATIONS   P  3.   CHARITABLE   CONTRIBUTION   AND   REDEMPTION  Grove   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Second   Circuit,   1973.  490   F.2d   241.  m KAUFMAN,   CHIEF   JUDGE:  We   are   called   upon,   once   again,   to wrestle   with   the tangled   web   that is   the   Internal   Revenue   Code   and   decipher   the   often   intricate   and ingenious   strategies   devised   by taxpayers   to minimize   their   tax burdens. We   undertake   this   effort   mindful   that   taxpayer   ingenuity,   although  channelled   into   an   effort to reduce   or eliminate   the incidence   of taxation,  is ground   for neither   legal   nor   moral   opprobrium.   As   Learned   Hand   so eloquently   stated,   “any one   may   so arrange   his affairs   that his taxes   shall be   as   low   as   possible:   he is not   bound   to choose   that   pattern   which   will  best   pay   the Treasury:   there   is not   even   a patriotic   duty to increase   one’s taxes   * * * .” Helvering   v.   Gregory,   69   F.2d   809,   810   (2d   Cir.1934),   affd  293   U.S.   465,   55 S.Ct.   266,   79 L.Ed.   596   (1935).  **K*  1  A full recitation of the undisputed facts underlying this controversy will aid in placing the   legal issues   raised on appeal in their proper  context.  Philip Grove received an engineering   degree in 1924 from Rensselaer  Polytechnic Institute, a private, tax-exempt educational institution. During the Depression,   he founded what is now   Grove Shepherd Wilson & Kruge, Inc. and at all times since has   controlled a majority of its  shares. The balance of the Corporation’s shares, with the exception of  those   held by RPI, are owned by officers and employees of the  Corporation or their   relatives.  The Corporation’s   business is building airfields, highways, tunnels, canals, and other   similar heavy construction projects in both the United  States and foreign   countries. These projects usually   involve   the investment of large sums of money over   an extended period of time   and involve a high   degree of risk. Since,   in  this industry,   contract payments normally are made only after specified   levels   of progress are achieved, a  firm must   always   commit substantial amounts of its own funds, whether borrowed or internally   generated, to  a project. Moreover, a company can  determine an acceptable   contract   price based   only on its best estimate of  the cost  to complete the  project. A bad   “guess” or unforeseen   contingency  may require a firm to complete a project   while   incurring a   loss. Not surprisingly,   the   mortality   rate   in   this industry is high.   To   protect  against   such   adverse   developments,   successful   firms   seek to maintain liquidity by  holding   ample   cash or other   assets   easily   converted to  cash.

--- Page 343 ---

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS   273  One   method of conserving cash, adopted by the Corporation, is to retain all earnings   and refrain from   paying dividends.  As   we   have   noted,   RPI,   like   all universities   and   colleges,   pursued   its  alumni   with   a wide   variety   of contribution   plans.   One   plan employed   “life income   funds,”   and   its terms   were   simple.   An   alumnus   would   make a gift  of securities   to   RPI   and   retain   a   life   interest   in   the   income   from   the donated   securities.   Whatever   dividends   and   interest   were   paid   during the   donor’s   life would   belong   to the   donor,   while   any   capital   appreciation would   inure   to RPI.   Upon   the   death   of the   donor,   RPI   would   obtain   full title to the   securities. In   1954,   Dr.   Livingston   Houston,   RPI’s   president,   suggested   to  Grove   that   he   make   a   gift   under   the   “life   income   funds”   plan.   Grove explained   that   his   only   significant   holdings   were   shares   of   his   own  corporation,   but   expressed   a willingness   to donate   some   of these   shares  under   the   plan,   with   certain   qualifications.   The   Corporation,   he   stated, could   not   agree   to any   obligation   or understanding   to redeem   shares   held by RPI.   This   condition,   of course,   stemmed   from   a fear   that   RPI   might  seek   redemption   at   a   time   when   the   Corporation   was   hard   pressed   for cash,   which,   as   we   have   noted,   was   an   asset   crucial   to a company   in the  heavy   construction   business.   Moreover,   since   Grove   at   that   time   was  unsure   of   RPI’s'   money-management   qualifications,   he   further conditioned   his   gift on   a requirement   that   if RPI   disposed   of the   shares,  any   proceeds   would   be   invested   and   managed   by   an   established  professional   firm.  RPI   found   these   terms   acceptable   and   on   December   30,   1954,   Grove  made   an   initial   gift   of   200   shares,   valued   at   $25,560.   A   letter  accompanying   the   donation   set   forth   the   conditions   we   have   recited. Moreover,   in addition   to retaining   an   interest   in the income   from   the gift  for   his   life,   Grove   specified   that   in the   event   he   should   predecease   his  wife   Harriet,   she   would   receive   the   income   until   her   death.  On   the   same   day,   the   Corporation   and   RPI   signed   a   minority shareholder   agreement.   RPI   agreed   not   to “sell, transfer,   give,   pledge   or hypothecate,   or   in   any   way   dispose   of   the   whole   or   any   part   of the common   stock of the Corporation   now   or hereafter   owned   * * * until   [RPI]  shall   have   first offered   the   Corporation   the   opportunity   to purchase   said shares   upon   the   terms   and   conditions   hereinafter   provided.”   The  redemption   price was   established   at book   value   of the shares   as noted   on the   Corporation’s   most   recent   certified   financial   statement   prior   to the  offer.   Pursuant   to   the   contract,   the   Corporation   was   “entitled   (but   not  obligated)   to purchase   all or   any   part   of the   shares   of stock   so offered.”   If  the   Corporation   did not   exercise   its option   to purchase   within   sixty days, RPI   could   transfer   the   shares   to any   other   party   and   the   Corporation’s

274  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  right   of first   refusal   would   not   subsequently   attach   to such   transferred shares. The   1954   gift was   the first in a series   of annual   contributions   to RPI by Grove.   From   1954   to 1968,   Grove   donated   to RPI   between   165   and   250 shares   of the Corporation   each   year,   reaching   a cumulative   total of 2,652 shares,   subject   to terms   substantially   similar   to those   noted   earlier. Generally,   RPI   offered   donated   shares   to   the   Corporation   for redemption,   between   one   and   two   years   after   they   were   donated   by Grove.   The   transactions   followed   a similar   pattern.   On   each   occasion,   the  Finance   Committee   of RPI’s   Board   of Trustees   first   authorized   the   sale  of specific   shares   of the   Corporation.   RPI’s   treasurer   or controller   would then   write   to Sidney   Houck,   the   Corporation’s   treasurer,   informing   him of RPI’s   desire   to dispose   of the shares.   Upon   receipt   of this letter,   Houck would   call   a   special   meeting   of the   Corporation’s   board   of directors   to consider   whether   or not to exercise   the Corporation’s   right of first refusal. The   Board   would   adopt   a resolution   authorizing   redemption   and   Houck  would   so inform   RPI’s   financial   officer,   enclosing   a company   check   for the  amount   due.   By   return   mail,   RPI   would   forward   the   appropriate   stock  certificate   to the   Corporation   for cancellation.  At the time of the first redemption, in December, 1955, RPI   opened  an investment account at the Albany, New York, office of Merrill Lynch,  Pierce, Fenner & Beane (“Merrill Lynch”). The account   was   captioned “Rensselaer   Polytechnic Institute (Philip H. Grove   Fund) Account.” In accordance with   Grove’s wishes   concerning the management of disposition proceeds, RPI authorized Merrill Lynch to act directly upon  investment recommendations   made by Scudder, Stevens, & Clark,  Grove’s personal investment adviser. RPI deposited the proceeds of each  redemption transaction into   this account   which, pursuant to Scudder,  Stevens & Clark’s   instructions, were   generally   invested in securities of large corporations whose shares   traded on organized stock exchanges. Merrill Lynch paid the income from these   investments to RPI on a  monthly basis. RPI, in   turn, made quarterly remittances to Grove,  accompanied   by an analysis of all account   transactions. On his personal income tax return for 1963, Grove reported as  taxable income   dividends of $4,939.28   and interest   of $2,535.73   paid to  him   by RPI   from the   Merrill Lynch account.   For   1964, Grove   reported  $6,096.05 in dividends   and   $3,540.81 in   interest. The   Commissioner, however,   assessed deficiencies   in Grove’s   taxable incéme for these   years,  asserting   that Grove “realized   additional   dividends in   the amounts of  $29,000   and   $25,800 in 1963   and 1964,   respectively, as the   result   of  the  redemption of   stock by   Grove   Shepherd   Wilson & Kruge, Inc.”  Accordingly,   the Commissioner increased   Grove’s   taxable   income   by  ie A  % Other   minority   shareholders of  the Corporation   signed   similar   agreements,   which, in effect put in writing   the   Corporation’s   practice   of redeeming,   when financial   conditions  permitted,   any   minority-owner   shares   offered to it, for example, by a departi  deceased   employee’s   widow. pace   secre eared

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL LIQUIDATIONS  these amounts and demanded payment of additional taxes—in excess of $13,000 for each year. Grove refused to pay and petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of  his tax liability. The Court, concluding that  Grove   had made a bona fide gift to RPI, ruled in favor of the taxpayer  and the Commissioner appealed.  II.  The   Commissioner’s   view   of this case   is relatively   simple.   In essence,  we   are   urged   to disregard   the   actual   form   of the   Grove-RPI-Corporation  donations   and   redemptions   and   to   rewrite   the   actual   events   so   that  Grove’s   tax   liability   is seen   in a wholly   different   light.   Support   for this position,   it   is   argued,   flows   from   the   Supreme   Court’s   decision   in  Commissioner   of Internal   Revenue   v.   Court   Holding   Co.,   324   U.S.   331,  65   S.Ct.   707,   89   L.Ed.   981   (1945),   which,   in   language   familiar   to   law  students,   cautions   that   “[t]he   incidence   of taxation   depends   upon   the  substance   of   a   transaction   ***.   To   permit   the   true   nature   of   a  transaction   to   be   disguised   by   mere   formalisms,   which   exist   solely   to  alter   tax   liabilities,   would   seriously   impair   the   effective   administration of the tax   policies   of Congress.”   Id. at 334,   65   S.Ct.   at 708.   In an   effort to bring   the   instant   case   within   this   language,   the   Commissioner   insists  that   whatever   the   appearance   of   the   transactions   here   under consideration,   their   “true   nature”   is quite   different.   He   maintains   that  Grove,   with   the   cooperation   of RPI,   withdrew   substantial   funds   from   the  Corporation   and   manipulated   them   in   a   manner   designed   to   produce  income   for   his   benefit.   In   the   Commissioner’s   view,   the   transaction   is  properly   characterized   as a redemption   by the Corporation   of Grove’s,   not  RIP’s   shares,   followed   by a   cash   gift to RPI   by Grove.   This   result,   it is said,   more   accurately   reflects   “economic   reality.” The   Commissioner’s   motives   for insisting   upon   this   formulation   are easily   understood   once   its   tax   consequences   are   examined.   Although Grove   reported   taxable   dividends   and   interest   received   from   the Merrill  Lynch   account   on   his   1963   and   1964   tax   returns,   amounts   paid   by the  Corporation   to redeem   the donated   shares   from   RPI   were   not taxed   upon  distribution.   If,   however,   the   transactions   are   viewed   in   the   manner  suggested   by   the   Commissioner,   the   redemption   proceeds   would   be taxable   as   income   to Grove.   Moreover,   because   the   redemptions   did   not  in substance   alter   Grove’s   relationship   to the   Corporation—he   continued throughout   to   control   a   majority   of the   outstanding   shares—the   entire proceeds   would   be   taxed   as   a   dividend   payment   at   high,   progressive  ordinary-income   rates,   rather   than   as a sale   of shares,   at the   fixed,   and  -relatively   low,   capital   gains   rate.   See,   26   U.S.C.   § 302;   United   States   v.  Davis,   397   U.S.   301,   90 S.Ct.   1041,   25 L.Ed.2d   323   (1970).  Clearly,   then,   the   stakes   involved are   high. We do  not   quarrel   with the maxim that   substance   must   prevail   over   form,   but this proposition marks the  beginning,   not   the   end,   of our   inquiry.   The   court   in Sheppard  v. United   States,   361   F.2d   972,   176   Ct.Cl.   244   (1966)   perceptively  remarked   that   “all  such   ‘maxims’   should   rather   be called   ‘minims’   since  275

Each   case   requires   detailed   consideration   of its unique   facts. Here,   our   aim   is to determine   whether   Grove’s   gifts of the   Corporation’s shares   to   RPI   prior   to   redemption   should   be   given   independent  significance   or   whether   they   should   be   regarded   as   meaningless intervening   steps   in   a   single,   integrated   transaction   designed   to   avoid tax   liability by the   use   of mere   formalisms. The   guideposts   for our   analysis   are   well   marked   by earlier   judicial  encounters   with   this   problem.   “The   law   with   respect   to   gifts   of  appreciated   property   is well   established.   A   gift of appreciated   property  does   not   result   in income   to the   donor   so   long   as   he   gives   the   property away   absolutely   and parts   with   title thereto   before   the property   gives rise  to   income   by   way   of   sale.”   Carrington   v.   Commissioner   of   Internal  Revenue,   476   F.2d   704,   708   (5th Cir.1973),   quoting   Humacid   Co., 42 T.C.  894,   913   (1964).   As noted   below   by the Tax   Court,   the   Commissioner   here  “does   not   contend   that   the   gifts   of stock   by   [Grove]   to RPI   in   1961   and 1962   were   sham   transactions,   or that they were   not completed   gifts when made.”   If   Grove   made   a   valid,   binding,   and   irrevocable   gift   of   the Corporation’s   shares   to   RPI,   it would   be   the   purest   fiction   to   treat   the  redemption   proceeds   as having   actually   been   received   by Grove.   The   Tax  Court   concluded   that   the   gift was   complete   and   irrevocable   when   made.  The   Commissioner   conceded   as   much   and   we   so find.9 It is argued, however, that notwithstanding the conceded validity of  the gifts, other circumstances establish   that Grove employed   RPI   merely  as a convenient conduit for withdrawing funds   from the Corporation for his personal use without   incurring tax  lability. The Commissioner would have us infer from the systematic   nature of the gift-redemption cycle that Grove   and   RPI   reached a mutually beneficial understanding:   RPI   would  permit   Grove to use its tax-exempt status to drain funds   from the Corporation in return for a donation of a future   interest in such funds.  We are not persuaded   by this argument and the totality   of the facts and   circumstances lead us  to a contrary conclusion. Grove testified before  the Tax   Court   concerning the circumstances of these gifts. The court, based on the evidence   and the witnesses’ credibility,   specifically found that   “[t]here was no informal agreement   between [Grove] and   RPI that  RPI   would offer the   stock in question to the corporation for redemption  or that, if offered,   the corporation would   redeem it.” Findings of fact by  the Tax Court, like those of the district   court,   are binding   upon us unless they are clearly erroneous,   26  U.S.C. § 7482(a): Rule 52, F.R.Civ:Pand  “the rule *  * * applies also to factual   inferences   [drawn]   from   undisputed  9 The Commissioner   might   have   argued that at least   that   portion of  the redemption proceeds allocable to Grove’s   retained life income interest was   taxable as   a dividend. He chose not to do so and the Tax   Court   “express[ed] no opinion   upon the   question, if it were   properly presented,   whether petitioner   derived   taxable   income   upon   the redemption of  stock to the  extent of  the life estate which   he retained * *  * .” Since   the Commissioner   has   bypassed this   aspect, it  would   be   inappropriate in  our   discussions   of  the gif i ignifi  ina) s gilts   to attach any special  retained life interest   feature. oe   ey ence da   the

It cannot seriously  be contended that   the Tax Court’s findings   here are “clearly erroneous”  and no tax liability can be predicated upon a nonexistent agreement between Grove   and RPI or by a fictional one created by the  Commissioner.  Grove,   of course,   owned   a substantial   majority   of the   Corporation’s  shares.   His   vote   alone   was   sufficient   to insure   redemption   of any   shares  offered by RPI.   But   such   considerations,   without   more,   are   insufficient   to  permit   the   Commissioner   to   ride   roughshod   over   the   actual  understanding   found   by the   Tax   Court   to   exist   between   the   donor   and  the   donee.   Behrend   v. United   States   (4th   Cir.1972),   73-1   USTC   § 9123,  is particularly   instructive.   There,   two   brothers   donated   preferred   shares of a corporation   jointly controlled   by them   to a charitable   foundation   over which   they   also   exercised   control.   The   preferred   shares   were subsequently   redeemed   from   the   foundation   by the   corporation   and   the Commissioner   sought   to   tax   the   redemption   as   a   corporate   dividend payment   to the   brothers.   The   court,   in denying   lability,   concluded   that although   “it was   understood   that   the corporation   would   at intervals   take  up   the preferred   according   to its financial   ability * * * , this factor   did not  convert   into   a constructive   dividend   the   proceeds   of the   redemption   * * *  [because]   the   gifts   were   absolutely   perfected   before   the   corporation  redeemed   the   stock.”   Id.  Nothing   in   the   December,   1954,   minority   shareholder   agreement between   the   Corporation   and   RPI   serves   as   a   basis   for   disturbing   the conclusion   of the   Tax   Court.   Although   the   Corporation   desired   a right   of first   refusal   on   minority   shares—understandably   so,   in order   to reduce  the   possibility   of unrelated,   outside   ownership   interests—it   assumed   no  obligation   to   redeem   any   shares   so   offered.   In   the   absence   of such   an  obligation,   the   Commissioner’s   contention   that   Grove’s   initial   donation  was   only   the   first   step   in   a   prearranged   series   of transactions   is little more   than   wishful   thinking   grounded   in a shaky   foundation.   * * * We are   not so naive as   to believe   that   tax considerations   played no role   in Grove’s   planning.   But foresight and   planning do not transform a non-taxable event into one   that is taxable. Were we to adopt the  Commissioner’s view, we   would be required to recast two actual  transactions—a gift by  Grove to RPI   and a redemption from   RPI   by the  Corporation—into two   completely fictional transactions—a   redemption from   Grove   by the Corporation   and a   gift by  Grove to RPI. Based   upon “the  facts  as found   by the Tax Court,   we   can   discover no  basis for elevating  the Commissioner’s “form”   over   that employed   by the taxpayer in good  faith. “Useful as the   step   transaction   doctrine may be   in   the  interpretation   of  equivocal   contracts   and   ambiguous events, it cannot  generate   events   which   never   took   place  just so an   additional   tax  liability  might   be   asserted.”   Sheppard v. United   States,   supra,   at   978.   In   the absence   of  any   supporting   facts   in the   record   we   are   unable   to  adopt   the  277

278   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Commissioner’s   view;   to do so would   be to engage   in a process   of decision that   is   arbitrary,   capricious   and   ultimately   destructive   of traditional notions   of judicial   review.   We   decline   to embark   on   such a course.  Accordingly,   the judgment   of the Tax   Court   is affirmed.  mg OAKES,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE   (dissenting): Review   of the   tax   consequences   of a business   transaction   requires consideration   of the   economic   realities   of the   entire   transaction.   See  Gregory   v.   Helvering,   293   U.S.   465,   55   S.Ct.   266,   79   L.Ed.   596   (1935);  South   Bay Corp. v. Commissioner   of Internal   Revenue,   345   F.2d   698,   703,  705   (2d Cir.1965).   Whether   a transaction   should   be viewed   as two   or more  steps   or as one   integrated   transaction   may   result   in entirely   different   tax  consequences.   * * *  Here, as I see it, the form of the transaction was two-step: a gift of stock followed by a redemption of the   stock by the donor controlled  corporation. The   substance of the transaction, however, was a payment  out of corporate earnings   and profits to a charity designated by the donor  who retained a life interest in the gift.  The factors which distinguish the RPI-Grove transactions from other charitable donations of securities and which   persuade   me to treat this as an integrated   transaction are two: first, the gifts made by the Groves were of stock in a closed corporation that was inevitably redeemed annually; second, by virtue of retaining a life income from the reinvested proceeds and by retaining a measure of control   over how those proceeds should be reinvested (by designating the investment adviser who was also the Groves’ personal adviser),   the Groves   were able to achieve a bail- out from their non-dividend-paying closed corporation.  **K*  The majority   opinion relies heavily on two cases which I  believe are readily distinguishable   from the situation here. One is Carrington v.  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 476   F.2d   704 (5th Cir.1973), relied on for the proposition that “[a] gift of appreciated   property does not  result in income to the donor so long as he gives   the property away absolutely and parts with title before   the property gives rise to income   by  way of sale.” Here the Groves did   not   part with all interest   in the construction  company stock. The reservation of a life interest   in the   stock (or its  reinvested   proceeds), when coupled   with   taxpayer’s right, however indirect, to direct the manner in which   proceeds would be invested,   gave  the Groves a very   great continuing interest and control, a fact   of  not  inconsiderable tax   significance. Cf. Corliss v. Bowers, 281   U.S.   376,   378, 50   8.Ct.   336,   74   L.Ed.   916   (1930) (Holmes, J.) (“taxation is not so much  concerned   with   the refinements of title  as  it  is with   actual command over the   property   taxed. *  *  * ”). More   importantly,   Carrington   involved   only one   contribution   of  stock and   one redemption;   there   was no pattern   of redemption of  stock as was   clearly   established   here at  least by  the   time of  the tax  years   in  question.

CHAPTER   5   REDEMPTIONS   AND   PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  In Behrend   v. United   States,   CCH   1973   Stand.Fed.Tax   Rep.   § 9123  (4th   Cir.1972),   also   relied   upon   by   the   majority,   the   proceeds   of the redemption   were   used   wholly   for the benefit   of the charitable   foundation  which   was   the   recipient   of the   stock;   there   was   no   life estate   reserved   for  the   personal   benefit   of the   donors.   See   1973   Stand.Fed.Tax   Rep.   4 9123 at   80,067   (“[P]redominant   force”   in   Behrend   decision   is   “indisputable  fact”   that   the   taxpayers   therein   “did   not   participate   whatsoever   in the  beneficence   of the   foundation’).  Thus,   I believe   that   when,   as   here,   the   nature   and   conditions   of the  charitable   gift and   the   pattern   of donor-charity   behavior   are   such   as   to  make   it for all practical   purposes   inevitable   that   the   stock   given   will be  offered   for   redemption   and   accepted   by   the   closely   held   corporation,  resulting   in providing   the   equivalent   of a safe pension   fund   for the donor  stockholders,   then   the   transaction   must   be   treated   as   a   distribution   of  dividends   under   §§ 301(a),   301(c)   and   316(a)   of the   Internal   Revenue Code   of   1954.   The   majority   opinion   refers   to   an   “absence   of   any  supporting   facts   in the record”   for the   Commissioner’s   position,   but omits to rely upon   the   one   most   important   fact   on   which   the   case   should   turn:  the   pattern   of redemption   over   years   of giving.   I accordingly   dissent.  NOTE  The Grove case   illustrates   an effective charitable   giving technique for the shareholders of a closely held corporation   with the   financial capacity to  repurchase its stock. After   losing   several   similar cases, the Service stopped  challenging “charitable bailouts,” announcing in Revenue Ruling 78-197131 that a charitable   contribution of stock followed by a redemption   would be  treated as a dividend to the donor only if the donee is legally bound or can   be compelled   by the corporation to surrender the shares for redemption.!3?  Although they may not be legally obligated to do so, most charities will be highly motivated to offer the shares for redemption in order to convert the stock into a more liquid and diversified investment. One desirable   aspect of the transaction in Grove   was Mr.   Grove’s ability to retain a life income interest in a diversified   portfolio managed by his personal investment advisor. This format is no longer   available to the  philanthropic   shareholder unless   certain   additional requirements are met.  In  general, a donor who wishes to retain a life income interest in contributed property will not   qualify for charitable income   and gift tax deductions unless the gift  is made to a qualified   charitable remainder   annuity trust or unitrust or   a pooled income fund.!83  131   1978-1   C.B.   83.  1382 See also Palmer v. Commissioner, 62   T.C. 684 (1974), affirmed on another issue, 523  F.2d   1308 (8th   Cir.1975), where the gift was made to   a private   foundation controlled by the taxpayer.   The Service, however,   may continue to challenge   transactions   where the donated property is later reacquired   by the   donor, or where the  charity   uses   the redemption   proceeds to  acquire   other  property from   the donor, pursuant to an  informal  prearranged   understanding.   See Blake v. Commissioner,   697   F.2d   473   (2d Cir.1982). 133 See   LR.C.   §§  170(f)(2),   (8); 664;   2522(c)(2).  a  279

280  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  PROBLEM  Philanthropist   (“P”) owns   25,000   shares   of Family   Corporation.   The fair  market   value   of P’s Family   stock   is $2,500,000   ($100   per   share);   P’s basis   is  $25,000   ($1 per   share).   Family   has   100,000   shares   of common   stock   (its only class)   outstanding;   the   remaining   shares   are   owned   by   P’s   spouse   and children.   Family   has   ample   accumulated   earnings   and   profits.   The   Family bylaws   require   all   shareholders   to   grant   the   corporation   a   right   of first refusal   to buy   their   stock   at fair market   value   before   the   shares   are   offered for   sale   to   an   outsider,   but   the   corporation   is not   required   to   redeem   the stock.  On   the occasion   of his 25th   college   reunion,   P wishes   to make   a $100,000  contribution   to State   University   (“SU”).   Consider   the tax consequences   of the following   alternative   plans: (a)   Family   Corporation   distributes   $100,000   to P in redemption   of  1,000   shares   of stock.   P then   contributes   $100,000   to SU.  (b) P contributes 1,000 shares of Family stock to SU. Two   months  later, pursuant to an oral understanding, Family distributes  $100,000 to SU in redemption of its 1,000   shares. SU was not  legally obligated to surrender the shares for redemption.  (c) Same as (b), above, except that P contributes   250   shares of  Family stock to SU in each of the   four years following his  reunion. (Assume that   the value of the   stock was $100 per  share throughout this period.) Two   months after each contribution, Family distributes $25,000 to SU in redemption of the 250 shares.  G. REDEMPTIONS   THROUGH RELATED   CORPORATIONS  Code: § 304(a); (b)(1), (2), (3)(A) & (B); (©).  Regulations:   §§  1.804—2(a), (c) Examples (1) & (3), —3(a). Section   304 is an   intricate statutory watchdog designed to prevent  an end run around Sections   301 and 302. Despite its complexity, the basic purpose of Section 304—to prevent controlling shareholders   from  claiming basis recovery   and capital gain treatment on transactions that  result   in a “bailout”   of corporate   earnings   without a significant reduction  in control—can be   illustrated by a simple   example. Assume that Shareholder A owns all of  the common stock   (the only class outstanding) of X Corporation   and Y Corporation,   and   both   corporations   have   ample earnings   and profits. Having read   the Davis case, A   knows that a  redemption of  either   her X or Y stock will result   in a dividend   and no recovery of basis. But   what if A sells some of her X shares to Y or vice versa? Because this  is a “sale” rather   than a redemption or  a distribution,  A hopes to extract   cash   while   enjoying   exchange   treatment,   but   in  substance A’s   “gale”   is indistinguishable   from a dividend.   Section   304  ensures   this   result   requiring shareholder   sales   involving   “brother- sister” and   “parent-subsidiary”   corporations to  satisfy   one of the   tests   in

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  Section 302 in order to qualify for capital gain status and recovery of  _hasis.—  Section   304   is another   area   where   the tax   stakes   are   less significant as   long   as   dividends   and   long-term   capital   gains   are   taxed   at the   same preferential   rates.   As   with   conventional   redemptions   and   other  transactions   to be   studied   later   in this   text,   the   importance   of dividend  classification   will   depend   on   variables   such   as   the basis   of the   stock   and the   type   of shareholder   (individual   vs.   corporate)   involved.  Brother-Sister   Acquisitions.   Section   304(a)(1)   applies   when   one   or more   persons   who   are   in   “control”   of each   of two   corporations   transfer  stock   of   one   corporation   (the   “issuing   corporation”)   to   the   other   (the “acquiring   corporation”)   in   exchange   for   cash   or   other   property.134  “Control”   for this   purpose   is defined   as   at least   50   percent   ownership   of  either   the   corporate   voting   power   or   of the   total   value   of all classes   of  stock.135   In   determining   control,   the   Section   318   attribution   rules   are  applicable   with   certain   modifications   relating   to shareholder-corporation  attribution.!36   In   the   case   of a   corporation   with   more   than   one   class   of  stock,   the   value   prong   of the   “control”   test   is applied   to   the   aggregate  value   of all classes   of stock,   not class-by-class.137   Thus,   a shareholder   who  owns   50   percent   or   more   of the   value   of all the   corporation’s   stock   has “control”   even   if   that   shareholder   owns   less   than   50   percent   of   a  particular   class.  If Section   304(a)(1)   applies,   Congress   devised   an   intricate   method   to  ‘test the   “sale”   for dividend   equivalence.   Returning   to the example,   when A   sells   X   Corporation   stock   to Y   Corporation   for   cash,   A   is treated   as having   received   a distribution   of cash   in redemption   of Y stock   (Y being  the   “acquiring   corporation”).138   This   hypothetical   redemption   is   then tested   under   Section   302(b)   to   determine   whether   A   may   treat   the  transaction   as   an   exchange.   Dividend   equivalence   is   determined   by  reference   to A’s   stock   ownership   of X (the “issuing   corporation”—1.e.,   the  company   whose   stock   is sold) before   and   after   the   transaction.189   To   the  extent   that   Y’s purchase   of X stock   from A   for cash   is characterized   as   a distribution   to   which   Section   301   applies,   A   is   treated   as   having  transferred   the   X   stock   to Y   (the acquiring   corporation)   in exchange   for  Y stock   in a tax-free   Section   351(a)   transaction,   and   then Y is treated   as having   redeemed   (from A) the Y stock   that   it hypothetically   issued   in the  134 For this purpose,   “property”   does   not include   stock of  the acquiring   corporation.

282  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Section   351   exchange.!4°   If the   distribution   is treated   as   an   exchange under   Section   302(a),   Y is treated   as   purchasing   the   stock   of X.141 In the   example,   A   owned   100   percent   of the   X   stock   before   the   sale to Y. After   the   sale,   A continued   to own   100   percent   of the   stock   directly  and   constructively   by virtue   of her   ownership   of Y. Because   the   sale   does not   reduce   A’s   interest   in X   (the   “issuing   corporation”),   it fails   to satisfy  any   of the Section   302(b)   tests   for exchange   treatment   and   thus   is treated  as   a Section   301   distribution   from   Y to A.   Section   304(b)(2)   requires   the  distribution   to   be   treated   as   a   dividend   received   by   A   from   Y   (the  “acquiring   corporation”)   to the extent   of Y’s earnings   and   profits   and   then from   X to the   extent   of its earnings   and   profits.   Thus,   the   earnings   and  profits   of both   corporations   are   available   to characterize   the   distribution  to A as   a dividend.142 Parent-Subsidiary   Acquisitions.   Section   304(a)(2)   applies   similar  principles   when   a controlled   subsidiary   acquires   stock   of its parent   from a shareholder   of the parent   in return   for property.   The   parent-subsidiary relationship   is defined   by the   same   50   percent   “control”   test   described above.!43   The   “property”   used   to   make   the   acquisition   is   treated   as   a distribution   in redemption   of the   parent’s   stock   for   purposes   of testing dividend   equivalency   under   Section   302.144   If the   redemption   fails   to qualify   as   an   exchange   and   thus   is treated   as   a Section   301   distribution, the   amount   and   source   of any   dividend   is first   determined   by reference to the   earnings   and   profits   of the   acquiring   (subsidiary)   corporation   and then,   if necessary,   by   the   earnings   and   profits   of the   issuing   (parent) corporation.!45   If the   constructive   redemption   is treated   as   an   exchange, the   selling   shareholders   recognize   gain   or   loss   under   normal   fax principles.  If  a transaction is both a brother-sister and a parent-subsidiary  acquisition,   the parent-subsidiary rules take   precedence.!46 But   because the attribution rules transform   most actual brother and _ sister  corporations into a constructive   parent   and subsidiary,   the regulations provide that   an   actual   brother-sister   relationship   takes precedence over  a constructive parent-subsidiary affiliation, causing Section   304(a)(1) to govern   acquisitions by related nonsubsidiary corporations. 147 Collateral Tax   Consequences. In the   basic Section   304(a)(1)   brother-  sister acquisition example above, where the amount paid by Y for A’s X  stock is treated as   a Section   301   distribution, A is deemed to have  40 T.R.C. § 304(a)(1).

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 283  transferred the X stock to Y in exchange for Y stock in a hypothetical  Section 351(a) exchange,   and Y is treated as having redeemed the Y stock  it hypothetically issued in that exchange. Y thus   takes a transferred  basis from A in the X stock under Section 362, and A’s basis in the Y stock  received in the hypothetical Section 351 exchange is equal to A’s basis in  the X stock   that A actually transferred to X.148 To the extent the  distribution is a dividend, the reduction in earnings   and profits   logically should follow the ordering rules in Section 304(b)(2)—i.e., first reduce the acquiring corporation’s earnings   and profits insofar as they are the  source of the dividend and then, if necessary, reduce the issuing corporation's earnings   and profits.  If Section   304(a)(1)   applies   and   A’s   sale   of X Corporation   stock   to Y  Corporation   is treated   as   an   exchange   under   Section   302(a),   Y is treated  as having   acquired   the X stock   by purchase   and   it thus   takes   a cost basis  under   Section   1012,   and   A’s   original   basis   in   his   Y   stock   remains  unchanged.   The   theory,   based   on   various   fictional   transactions   (i.e., A is  deemed   to receive   Y stock   in exchange   for X stock   and   then   Y is deemed to redeem   that Y stock   from   A for cash   or other   property)   is that A “sold” Y   stock   (to Y)   with   a   basis   equal   to   the   basis   of the   X   stock   actually  transferred   by A to Y. As   in any   actual   sale   or exchange,   the basis   of the  (hypothetical)   Y   stock   “sold”   by A   is fully recovered   in determining   gain  or   loss on   the   sale,   and   thus   A’s basis   in her   remaining   Y stock   should   be  the   same   as   it was   before   the transaction.!49  In the   brother-sister   scenario   where   the   redemption   is treated   as   an  exchange,   any   reduction   of earnings   and   profits   is limited   by   Section  312(n)(7)   to an   amount   not in excess   of the redeemed   stock’s   ratable   share  of   earnings   and   profits.59   The   more   difficult   question   is   which  corporation’s   earnings   and   profits?   The   Code   and   regulations   are   silent on   this   technical   teaser.   Possibilities   include   the   acquiring   corporation’s (the   transaction   is   treated   as   a   constructive   redemption   of   acquiring  corporation   stock   and   the   distributed   “property”   comes   from   that   entity), the   issuing   corporation’s   (the   redemption   is tested   by   reference   to   its  stock),   neither   (the   transaction   is simply   a purchase,   not   a reduction   of either   corporation’s   wealth),   or both   (pro rata?).15!   One   defensible   answer  is   that   the   required   reduction   should   be   made   first   to   the   acquiring  corporation’s   earnings   and   profits   and,   if necessary,   then   to the   issuing corporation’s   earnings   and   profits. << Ina parent-subsidiary acquisition, if the  constructive redemption of the  parent’s   stock is treated as  a dividend,   the  selling shareholder’s basis ‘in the parent stock   transferred to the   subsidiary is added to the basis   in  148 [.R.C. § 304(a)(1).   Reg. § 1.304-2(c) Example (1) reaches this   result using a different approach   based on   the   statute   before it was amended in  1997. 149 Reg. § 1.304—2(c) Example 3   reaches this   result   using   the approach that   preceded  statutory amendments to Section   304   in  1997.  150   See   Section   E2   of this chapter,   supra.  151 See   Bittker   &  Eustice,   supra   note  2,  J  9.24[3].

If the   redemption  is treated   as   an   exchange,   the   selling   shareholder   recovers   his   basis   in  the   transferred   parent   stock   and   recognizes   capital   gain   or   loss   under normal   tax   principles.   The   subsidiary   takes   a cost   basis   in the   acquired  parent   stock.   If the   constructive   redemption   is treated   as   an   exchange,  Section   312(n)(7)   again   should   apply,   but it is unclear   which   corporation’s  earnings   and   profits   are   reduced,   leaving   taxpayers   to   apply   any reasonable   approach.  Coordination   with   Section   351.   Enactment   of an   intricate   statute such   as   Section   304   inevitably   whets   the   appetite   of   tax   lawyers.  Consider   the   sole   shareholder   of a profitable   company   with   a   desire   for cash   and a distaste   for dividends   at a time   when   dividends   were   taxed   at  much   higher   rates   than   capital   gains.   Assume   that   the   shareholder  borrows   against   his stock   for valid business   reasons   and   then   contributes  the stock   to a newly   formed   holding   company   in exchange   for the holding  company’s   stock   plus   its   assumption   of the   shareholder’s   hability.   Or  assume   that   the   shareholder   transferred   all the   stock   of the   operating  company   to a wholly   owned   holding   company   in exchange   for additional  stock of the holding   company   plus cash.   Are   the tax consequences   of these  transactions   determined   under   Section   351?   Or   should   they be governed by Section   304?   Initially,   the courts   disagreed   on   which   provision   should  control   in these   overlap   situations.154 In   an effort   to strengthen the anti-bailout   objectives of Subchapter C, Congress settled the overlap issue by providing that Section   304 generally will take   precedence.455 The Joint Committee on Taxation  explained the amendment as follows:156  The Act extends the anti-bailout rules   of sections 304 * * *  to the   use   of corporations,   including   holding companies,   formed  or availed of to avoid   such rules. Such rules are made applicable  to   a transaction that otherwise qualifies as   a tax-free  incorporation   under section   351.  a  152 Reg. § 1.304—3(a).  153 Cf. Rev.

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 285  Section   351   generally   will   not   apply   to   transactions  described   in   section   304.   Thus,   section   351,   if   otherwise applicable,   will   generally   apply   only   to   the   extent   such  transaction   consists   of an   exchange   of stock   for   stock   in   the  acquiring   corporation.   However,   section   304   will   not   apply   to debt   incurred   to acquire   the   stock   of an   operating   company   and  assumed   by   a   controlled   corporation   acquiring   the   stock   since  assumption   of   such   debt   is   an   alternative   to   a   debt-financed  direct   acquisition   by the   acquiring   company.   This   exception   for acquisition   indebtedness   applies   to   an   extension,   renewal,   or  refinancing   of such   indebtedness.   The   provisions   of section   357  (other   than   sec.   357(b))   and   Section   358   apply   to   such acquisition   indebtedness   provided   they   would   be   applicable   to such   transaction   without   regard   to   section   304.   In   applying  these   rules,   indebtedness   includes   debt   to   which   the   stock   is  subject   as   well   as   debt   assumed   by the   acquiring   company.  **e*  This   rule,   like   several   other   anti-bailout   measures   in Subchapter   C,  is much   less   significant   as   long as   dividends   and   long-term   capital   gains  are   taxed   at the   same   low   rate.  Niedermeyer   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Tax   Court,   1974. 62 T.C.   280,   affirmed   per   curiam   535   F.2d   500   (9th Cir.1976), cert.   denied   429   U.S.   1000,   97   S.Ct.   528   (1976).  =   STERRETT,   JUDGE:   * * *  [In   1966,   the   taxpayers,   Bernard   and   Tessie   Niedermeyer,   owned  22.58%   of the common   stock of American   Timber   & Trading   Co., Inc.   “AT &   T”).   They   also   owned   125   of the   2,136   outstanding   shares   of AT   &   T  preferred   stock.   Two   of the   taxpayers’   sons,   Bernard,   Jr.   and   Walter,  owned   67.91%   of the common   stock   of AT   & T.  Lents   Industries (“Lents”) was   another   corporation controlled by the Niedermeyer family.   In   1966,   the taxpayers   and their   sons, Bernard, Jr.  and   Walter, did   not own any stock of Lents,   but   three   other   sons   (Kd,  Linus   and Thomas) each owned   22%% of  the Lents common stock.  On   September 8, 1966,   the taxpayers sold   their AT   &   T stock to  Lents for $174,975.12,   but   they   retained all their preferred stock   until  December 28,   1966, when they   contributed the   preferred to   a family  foundation.   After this contribution,   the taxpayers   ceased to have   any  interest   in AT   & T. Since   the   time of their   sale   of AT   &  T  common stock,  neither   of   the   taxpayers   was   an officer, director or employee of  the  company.  The   Niedermeyer   family   had   long   been   active   in   the   business   of manufacturing   special   wood   products   in  Oregon.   During   1963,   a  family

286   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  dispute   arose   between   Bernard,   Jr.   and   his   brothers,   Ed,   Linus   and  Thomas.   The   brothers   had   been   partners   in   Niedermeyer-Martin   Co., another   wood   product   enterprise,   but the dispute   caused   the partnership to   incorporate.   During   the   mid-1960’s,   Bernard,   Jr.,   as   controlling shareholder   of AT   &   T, refused   to allow   AT   &   T to do any   business   with  Niedermeyer-Martin   Co., which   became   a competitor.   The   acquisition   by  Lents   of the taxpayers’   common   stock   in AT   & T was   part   of an   effort by Ed, Linus   and   Thomas   Niedermeyer   to gain   control   of AT   & T. On   their   joint   federal   income   tax   return   for   1966,   the   taxpayers reported   a long-term   capital   gain   of $168,321.58   on   the   sale   of their   AT  &   T   common   stock   to   Lents.   The   Commissioner   determined   that   the  entire   proceeds   of the   sale   were   taxable   as   ordinary   income   because   the transaction   was   covered   by Section   304(a)   and   was   essentially   equivalent to a dividend.   Ed.]  OPINION  The ultimate   question to be decided in this case is whether  petitioners   realized a capital gain or received a dividend on the sale   of  their AT   & T common stock to Lents in 1966. The resolution of this  question depends on whether the sale   in question was a redemption  through the   use of a related corporation under the provisions of section 304(a)(1) and, if so, whether the distribution by Lents to petitioners is  to be  treated as in exchange for the redeemed stock under the provisions of  section 302(a) or as of property to which section 301 applies.  Section 304(a)(1) provides, in pertinent part,   that, if one or more  persons are in “control” of each of two   corporations and if one of those corporations   acquires stock in the   other corporation   from the person or persons in control, then the transaction shall be  treated as   a distribution  in redemption for purposes of section 302. Section 304(c)(1) defines   the  term “control” as “the ownership of stock possessing at least 50 percent  of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock   entitled to vote,  or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock.”  Section 304(c)[(3)] then states that   the constructive ownership of stock rules contained in section   318(a) shall apply for the purpose of determining “control,” except that   the 50-percent limitations of sections 318(a)(2)(C) and 318(a)(3)(C) shall be disregarded for such   purpose.  It  is clear   that by its terms section   304(a)(1)   applies to the   factual  situation of   this   case. Prior to the transaction   ,here in question, petitioners, husband and wife, together   actually owned 1,083.117   shares  out  of  the 4,803.083   outstanding   shares of AT   &  T common stock, its only class   of  stock   entitled to  vote. Two of  petitioners’   sons owned 3,263.072 shares. Thus a   total   of 4,346.189   shares, or 90.49   percent,   of   the  outstanding   voting   stock   of AT   &  T  was   actually or constructively owned by petitioners. Three of  petitioners’   other   sons owned 48  out of  72 shares, or 67   percent,   of  the   outstanding   stock   of  Lents,   the ownership of  such stock   being   constructively   attributable   to   petitioners.   Consequently,  under   section   304(c)(1),   either   petitioner,   or   both,   are   regarded   as   the

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS 287  person   or   persons   in   control   of both   AT   &   T   and   Lents   prior   to   the transaction   in   question.   Accordingly,   under   section   304(a)(1)   the  transaction   in which   Lents   acquired   petitioners’   AT   &   T common   stock  must   be treated   as a redemption.   The   fact that neither   petitioner   actually owned   stock   in the   acquiring   corporation   is of no   concern   here.   * * *  Petitioners   object   to   the   applicability   of section   304   on   the   ground that   the   attribution   rules   of section   318(a)   should   not   be   applied   in this  case.   They   base   this   position   upon   what   they   term   the   “bad   blood” exception   to   the   attribution   rules   as   applied   in   Estate   of Arthur   H.  Squier,   35 T.C.   950   (1961).   In Squier,   a case   under   section   302   involving  the   question   of whether   a   distribution   was   essentially   equivalent   to   a  dividend,   this   Court   decided   that,   based   in   part   on   a   “sharp   cleavage”  between   the   executor   of the   taxpayer   estate   and   members   of the   Squier  family,   and   notwithstanding   the attribution   rules,   the redemption   in fact resulted   in a crucial   reduction   of the estate’s   control   over   the corporation.  The   Court   held that the distribution   there   was   not essentially   equivalent  to   a   dividend   and   implicit   in   this   conclusion   was   the   belief   that   the attribution   rules   were   not   conclusive   in   all   events   in   determining  whether   there   had been   a significant   change   of control   which   would   allow  the   conclusion   that   the   distribution   was   not   essentially   equivalent   to   a dividend.   We   note   that in Robin   Haft   Trust,   61 T.C.   398   (1973),   this Court  decided   that,   in light of United   States   v. Davis,   397   U.S.   301   (1970),   the rationale   of Squier   was   no   longer   applicable   to section   302(b)(1).  Besides   here,   as   was   not   the   case   with   Squier,   no   evidence   was  adduced   to   show   that   there   were   any   disputes   or   cleavage   between petitioners   and   any   of their   sons.   The   falling out was   apparently   between petitioners’   sons.   Apparently,   petitioners   would   have   us   infer   from   the disagreements   between   Bernard   E.   Niedermeyer,   Jr.,   majority  shareholder   of AT   &   T, and   three   other   of their   sons,   who   together   were  majority   shareholders   of Lents,   that   petitioners   did   not   in fact   control  either   corporation.   We   are   unwilling   to   make   this   assumption   and  consequently   petitioners’   argument   fails on   its facts. Moreover, we are   of the opinion that   the   “control” test of sections 304(a)(1) and 304(c) requires that   the   attribution rules be   applied in every case. Congress expressly   indicated that   the   attribution rules   of section   318 are to be   applied in determining “control” for section 304  purposes.   Section 304(c)(2)   states   that   “Section   318(a)   (relating to the constructive ownership of  stock)   shall apply for purposes of determining control under   paragraph (1).” (Emphasis supplied.) Under section  ~304(c)(1)   “control” is defined   only as the ownership (either   actually or  constructively) of  certain amounts of  stock. Through the   use   of  precise rules   of   attribution   Congress   intended to remove the   uncertainties existing   under prior   law, which   had no   specific   statutory   guidance for  constructive   ownership of  stock   in  the area   of  corporate   distributions   and adjustments,   in   the   administration   of  the   provisions   where   attribution  was   deemed   appropriate.

288  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  (Pub.L. No. 591), 83d Cong., 2d Sess., p. A96 (1954). See also Coyle v. United States, supra at 490. We think the attribution rules require,  through their employment in section 304, that petitioners   be treated as in actual   control of both AT   & T and Lents, notwithstanding any “bad blood” between petitioners’ sons.  Petitioners   assert   that   even   though   the   sale   is to   be   treated   as   a  distribution   in redemption   of Lents’   stock   under   section   304(a)(1),   they  are   entitled   to treat   the   distribution   as   in full payment   in exchange   for their   stock   under   section   302(a)   by meeting   one   of the   tests   contained   in  section   302(b).   The   determination   under   section   302(b)   is to be   made   by  reference   to the issuing corporation’s   stock,   here   the AT   & T stock,   except that   the   50-percent   limitations   of sections   318(a)(2)(C)   and   318(a)(3)(C) are   to be   disregarded   in applying   the   attribution   rules   of section   318(a). Sec.   304(b)(1).  Section   302(b)   sets   forth   certain   conditions   under   which   a  redemption   of stock   shall   be   treated   as   an   exchange.   If none   of those  conditions   are   met,   section   302(d)   provides   that   the   distribution   will then  be treated   as one   to which   section   301   applies.   Petitioners   do not   contend that   section   302(b)(2)   or   302(b)(4)   is applicable   but   they   argue   that   the  transaction   in   question   meets   the   test   of   either   section   302(b)(1)   or  302(b)(8).  The test of section   302(b)(1) requires that   the redemption be “not  essentially equivalent to   a dividend.” To meet the test of nondividend equivalency the redemption must, after application of the attribution rules of section 318(a) to the   stock ownership interests as they existed both before and after the redemption, result in  “a meaningful reduction  of the shareholder’s proportionate interest in the corporation.” United  States v. Davis, supra at 313. In resolution of the question of dividend equivalency, the fact that   the transaction in issue may have   had a bona  fide business   purpose is no longer relevant. United States v. Davis, supra at 312. Furthermore, the   applicability of the attribution rules   in section 302(b)(1) is not   affected by any   “bad   blood” between petitioners’ sons. Robin   Haft Trust, supra at 402—403.  As stated   above, prior to the redemption petitioners owned, either actually or constructively,   90.49   percent of the outstanding common stock  of AT   & T. After   the redemption, petitioners   actually owned no AT   & T common stock, although   they did own 125 shares out   Ol gelac  outstanding   shares of that   corporation’s   preferred stock. However,  petitioners   constructively owned 82.96   percent of the outstanding  common stock   of AT   &  T comprised as follows: 3,055.221   shares   actually owned   by their   son Bernard E. Niedermeyer, Jr., 207.851   shares   actually owned   by their   son Walter E. Niedermeyer,   and   67   percent of   the  1,083.117   shares, or 725.688   shares,   actually owned   by   Lents   and  constructively owned   by their   sons   E. Us   Wiel   Smt ceeds Niedermeyer.  Sec.   318(a)(5)(A). We do not   think a reduction   in ownership of  the AT   &  T   common stock   from   90.49   percent   to   82.96   percent   constitutes   a

--- Page 359 ---

ys “s  CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS  meaningful reduction of petitioners’ proportionate interest in AT   & T in  the instant case. See Friend v. United States, 345   F.2d 761, 764 (C.A.1, 1965); Stanley F. Grabowski Trust,   58 T.C. 650, 659 (1972); Fehrs  Finance Co., supra at 185-186. With such a small change in a high percentage interest, petitioners’   control and ownership of AT   & T is  essentially unaltered   and   cannot be considered to have undergone a meaningful reduction. An 82.96-percent interest   clearly is sufficient to dominate and control   the policies of the corporation.  Petitioners   next   assert,   under   several   theories,   that   they terminated  their   interest   in AT   &   T as   contemplated   in section   302(b)(3).   The   test  provided   therein   allows   the   redemption   to be treated   as   an   exchange   “if the   redemption   is   in   complete   redemption   of   all   of   the   stock   of   the corporation   owned   by the   shareholder.”   Unless   the   conditions   of section 302(c)(2)   are   satisfied   to exempt   petitioners   from   application   of the family attribution   rules   of section   318(a)(1),   these   rules   apply   in their   entirety in   determining   whether   there   has   been   a   redemption   of   petitioners’ complete   stock   interest   in AT   & T.  Petitioners   sold   all   their   AT   &   T   common   stock   to   Lents   on  September   8, 1966,   and   contributed   all their   AT   &   T preferred   stock   to  the   Niedermeyer   Foundation   on   December   28,   1966.   On   September   24, 1968,   petitioners   filed   an   amended   return   for the   calendar   year   1966   to  which   was   attached   the   agreement   called   for in section   302(c)(2)(A)(i11).  It is clear   that,   if they   are   to   meet   the   requirements   of the   test   of  section   302(b)(3),   petitioners   must   show   that   they completely   terminated  their   stock   interest   in AT   & T and   in so   doing   they   must   be able   to effect a waiver   of the   family   attribution   rules   of section   318(a)(1)   through   use  of section   302(c)(2). While   section   1.302—4(b),   Income   Tax   Regs.,   states   that   the agreement   specified   in   section   302(c)(2)(A)(iii)   must   be   attached   to   a  return   timely   filed   for the   year   in which   the   distribution   occurs,   several  cases   have   held   that   some   delay   in filing the   agreement   does   not   vitiate it, and   we   find   those   cases   to be   applicable   here   where   petitioners   filed the   agreement   upon   discovering   their inadvertent   failure   to do so earlier.  United   States   v.   G.W.   Van   Keppel,   321   F.2d   717   (C.A.10,   1963);   Georgie  S. Cary,   41   T.C.   214   (1963). However, the fact that a proper agreement was filed alone   does   not effect   a waiver of   the   family   attribution rules unless   the   other  requirements of   section   302(c)(2)   are   satisfied. The only   other  requirement in question   here is that   petitioners must   have   had no interest   in AT   & T, other   than an   interest as  a creditor, immediately after  the   distribution   referred to   in   section   302(b)(3).   In   the   instant case,  however,   petitioners   retained   their   125   shares of AT   &  T  preferred stock,  at  least   until December 28,   1966,   after   the redemption of all their AT   &  T  common stock   on September 8,  1966.  289

--- Page 360 ---

290  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Petitioners   contend   that   ownership   of these   125   shares   of AT   &   T  preferred   stock   until   December   28,   1966,   does   not   prevent   application   of  the   exemption   provided   in   section   302(c)(2)   and   consequently qualification   under   section   302(b)(3)   as   having   completely   terminated  their   stock   interest   in AT   & T. Petitioners   make   the following   arguments  to   show   that   the   AT   &   T   preferred   stock   retained   until   December   28,  1966,   was   not   the   retention   of an   interest   other   than   that   of a   creditor  and   implicitly   was   not the retention   of a stock   interest   in AT   & T: (1) The  preferred   stock was   actually   debt;   (2)   a de minimis   rule should   be applied; (3) the   relinquishment   of their   preferred   stock   interest   in   AT   &   T   on  December   28,   1966,   was   “immediately   after”   the   sale   of their   AT   &   T  common   stock   on   September   8, 1966;   and   (4) at   the   time   of the   sale   of their   AT   &   T   common   stock   they   intended   to   donate   their   AT   &   T  preferred   stock   to charity   before   the   year’s   end.  While   citing   no   cases   in their   support,   petitioners   first   argue   here that the characteristics   of the AT   & T preferred   stock   are   those   commonly associated   with   debt   instruments.   We   do not   agree.   A number   of factors have   been   considered   in resolution   of this question   of fact, see   O.H.   Kruse  Grain   &   Milling   v.   Commissioner,   279   F.2d   123,   125-126   (C.A.9,   1960),  affirming   a Memorandum   Opinion   of this   Court;   Wilbur   Security   Co.,   31  T.C.   938,   948   (1959),   affd.   279   F.2d   657   (C.A.9,   1960);   however,   we   see   no  useful   purpose   in   reciting   all   the   factors   but   will   confine   discussion herein   only to those   we   think   relevant.  While it is true   that   the preferred   stockholders had no right to  participate in the management of the corporation, such fact is not so uncharacteristic of preferred stock   rights as to be   conclusive, standing  alone, of the question at hand. John Kelley Co. v. Commissioner, 326 U.S. 521, 530 (1946). We think that   the following facts   are indicative of the  equity flavor   of the preferred stock: There   was no unconditional obligation to pay a principal sum certain on or before a fixed maturity  date;   the timing of preferred   “dividends” was   discretionary   with the  corporate directors; upon liquidation   the preferred   stockholders would be  paid   “from the money and/or property available for distribution to  shareholders,” which indicates to us that   the preferred stock was subordinated in   priority to the general creditors; AT   & T’s   articles   of amendment to the articles   of incorporation   used the terms   “dividends,” “preferred stock,” and   “shareholders”   with   reference to the instruments  in question; and the preferred stock was   created   during a reorganization by a transfer of earned   surplus to AT   & T’s capital   account.  We think   petitioners’ second argument   attempting to interject a de minimis rule allowing the   retention of some   small   stock   interest   while  qualifying   under section   302(b)(3) is wholly   without merit.   Section 302(b)(8)   clearly   requires   no   less than a complete   termination of all petitioners’   stock   interest   in  the  corporation. Petitioners   next   assert   that   they   had no   interest   in AT   &   T  “immediately after   the   distribution,”   as   the   phrase is used   in   section

--- Page 361 ---

CHAPTER 5 REDEMPTIONS AND PARTIAL   LIQUIDATIONS   291  302(c)(2)(A)(@), because the December 28, 1966, contribution   should be  considered to have occurred immediately after the September 8, 1966,  redemption. We assume petitioners believe   that if they satisfy this  requirement of having no interest “immediately after” the redemption,  they will also satisfy the requirement in section   302(b)(3) of having  completely terminated their stock   interest in AT   & T. While we express  no opinion on petitioners’ apparent belief, we think the words  “immediately after” must be given their ordinary meaning and that  consequently December 28 cannot be considered “immediately after”  September 8. Cf. Commissioner v. Brown, 380 U.S.   563, 570-571 (1965).  Petitioners’   final   argument   to   satisfy   the   requirements   of sections  302(b)(3)   and   302(c)(2)(A)(i)   is that,   at the time   of the transfer   of their AT  & T common   stock   to Lents,   they intended   to donate   their   remaining   AT &   T preferred   stock   to charity   by the   end   of 1966.   Petitioners   did in fact  contribute   their   125   shares   of AT   & T preferred   stock   to the Niedermeyer  Foundation   on   December   28,   1966.  While   petitioners’   contention   in this regard   is not entirely clear, their argument   appears   to be that the September   8, 1966,   transfer   was   but one step   in a plan   to terminate   completely   their   interest   in AT   & T, the final step   in   such   plan   being   their   December   28,   1966,   contribution   of their remaining   preferred   stock.   The   only   case   cited   by petitioners,   Arthur   D.  McDonald,   52   T.C.   82   (1969),   involved   the   question   of whether   a   plan,  calling for the redemption   of that taxpayer’s   E & M   preferred   stock which was   followed   by a reorganization   in which   the   taxpayer   exchanged   his   E  &   M   common   stock   for   Borden   stock,   resulted   in   a   distribution   with  respect   to   the   preferred   stock,   which   was   essentially   equivalent   to   a  dividend   under   section   302(b)(1).   The   Court   concluded   that,   after  completion   of the   plan,   the   taxpayer’s   direct   interest   in   E   &   M   was  terminated   and   consequently   the   redemption   was   not   essentially equivalent   to a dividend.   Petitioners   have   not   urged,   and   we   consider   it wise   since   the   attribution   rules   would   frustrate   them,   that   their  intention   to donate   the AT   & T preferred   stock   by year’s   end   shows   that  the   redemption   comes   within   the   provisions   of section   302(b)(1).   Rather, they   apparently   contend   that   their   intentions   to   donate   the   AT   saad   he  preferred   stock   constituted   a plan   to terminate   their   interest   in AT   & T  which,   with   use   of   section   302(c)(2)(A),   satisfies   the   requirements   of  section   302(b)(8).  Where   redemptions were   executed   pursuant to  a plan to terminate one’s   interest   in a corporation, it has   been   held  that   dividend   equivalency  “may be   avoided   where the   individual redemptions are component parts of a single   sale or exchange of  an   entire   stock   interest.

292   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  of several   steps,   one   involving   the   redemption   of stock   that   results   in a complete   termination   of the   taxpayer’s   interest   in a corporation,   section 302(b)(3)   may   apply.   Otis   P. Leleux,   54   T.C.   408   (1970);   Estate   of Oscar L. Mathis,   47   T.C.   248   (1966).   However,   the   redemption   must   occur   as  part   of a plan   which   is firm   and   fixed   and   in which   the   steps   are   clearly  integrated.   Otis P. Leleux,   supra   at 418.  We   regard   the   evidence   presented   on   petitioners’   behalf   as   too  insubstantial   to prove   the existence   of such   a plan.   Petitioner   Bernard   E. Niedermeyer’s   self-serving   statement   during   the trial that   at the   time   of  transfer   of the AT   & T common   stock   on   September   28,   1966,   he intended  to   donate   the   AT   &   T   preferred   stock   to   charity   by   year’s   end,   and petitioners’   prior history of contributions   do not   establish   to us   a firm   and  fixed   plan   in which   all the   steps   are   clearly   integrated. The   plan   certainly   was   not   in writing   and   there   was   no   evidence   of communication   of petitioners’   asserted   donative   intention   to the   charity  or   to   anyone.   One   of   petitioners’   sons   testified   that   Lents   acquired  petitioners’   AT   & T common   stock   in an   attempt   to gain   control   of AT   & T.   However,   no   mention   at   all   was   made   by   this   son   of any   desire   on petitioners’   part   to terminate   their   total   interest   in AT   &   T. Petitioners  could   easily have   changed   their minds   with regard   to any intent   to donate  the   preferred   stock.   Clearly   petitioners’   decision   to donate   the   preferred stock   has   not been   shown   to be in any   way   fixed   or binding.   * *   * We   note that Arthur   D. McDonald,   supra,   cited   by petitioners,   involved   a written  plan which   was   fixed as to its terms   and   apparently   binding.   By the above discussion   we   do not   mean   to indicate   that   all such   plans   need   to be   in writing,   absolutely   binding,   or communicated   to others,   but   we   do think that   the   above-mentioned   factors,   all of which   are   lacking   here,   tend   to  show   a plan   which   is fixed   and   firm.  Since   petitioners have not established that   the redemption is to be  treated as an exchange   under section   302(a), the proceeds are to be treated as   a distribution of property to which section   301   applies and as a dividend as determined   by the respondent. Decision will be  entered for the respondent.  PROBLEMS  1.   The   Niedermeyer case is  a good example of a tax planning blunder. It illustrates   the need for sensitivity to provisions   such as § 304.   In reading the case, make sure you   can answer the  following   questions:  (a) Why did § 304   apply to the sale by the taxpayers of  their AT   & T common stock to Lents?

294  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  even   if the   transaction   does   not   come   within   one   of the   Section   302(b)  tests.   If   several   detailed   requirements   are   met,   distributions   in  redemption   are   treated   as   a sale   or   exchange   rather   than   a dividend   up  to   the   sum   of federal   and   state   death   taxes   and   allowable   funeral   and  administrative   expenses.459   Curiously,   however,   the   estate   is   not  required   to use   (or even   need)   the   redemption   proceeds   to pay   taxes   and  expenses.  To   qualify   under   Section   308,   the   value   of the   redeemed   stock   must  be included   in determining   the   decedent’s   gross   estate   for federal   estate  tax   purposes.!60   The   other   principal   requirements   relate   to   the  relationship   of the   decedent’s   holdings   in   the   corporation   to   his   total  gross   estate   and   the   timing   of the   distribution. Relationship   of Stock   to Decedent’s   Estate.   Congress   concluded   that income   tax   relief   was   justified   only   when   a   decedent’s   holdings   in   the  corporation   represented   a substantial   portion   of his   gross   estate.   Section 303(b)(2)   requires   that   the   value   of   all   the   stock   of   the   distributing  corporation   included   in   the   decedent’s   gross   estate   must   exceed   35 percent   of   the   total   gross   estate   less   certain   expenses   deductible   for  federal   estate   tax   purposes.   A   special   rule   permits   the   stock   of two   or  more   corporations   to be aggregated   for purposes   of this   35 percent   test   if 20   percent   or   more   in value   of each   such   corporation’s   total   outstanding stock   is   included   in   the   gross   estate.   For   purposes   of   the   20   percent requirement,   stock held by the decedent’s   surviving   spouse   as community property,   or   held   with   the   decedent   prior   to   death   in   joint   tenancy, tenancy-by-the-entirety,   or   tenancy-in-common,   is treated   as   if it were included   in determining   the   value   of the   decedent’s   gross   estate.161   If a decedent’s   holdings   are   close   to the   35 percent   mark,   it may   be desirable to engage   in various   lifetime   and   post-mortem   maneuvers   to ensure   that  Section   303   will be available.  Timing of the Redemption. Section   303   applies   only to amounts distributed   within a reasonable time after the decedent’s death. The  redemption   must occur within 90 days after the expiration of the   three  year assessment period for federal   estate   taxes.162 If the   estate becomes embroiled in a controversy   with the Service and files   a petition for  redetermination of  estate   tax with the Tax Court,   the period is extended  to 60 days after the Tax Court’s   decision becomes final.163 A further extension is provided if the estate is eligible and elects to pay estate   taxes in installments over   the extended period   (up to 15 years) provided   by  Section   6166.164 But if the redemption occurs more   than four   years after  death,   the amount that   can   qualify for Section   303 treatment is limited  159   LR.C. §   303(a).  160   Id.  161 L.R.C. § 303(b)(2)(B). 1 LR.C. § 303(b)(1)(A).

Although   Section   303   is most   commonly   used  by the   decedent’s   estate,   other   shareholder-beneficiaries   sometimes   are  eligible   for its benefits   if their   interest   “is reduced   directly   (or through   a  binding   obligation   to   contribute)   by   any   payment”   of   death   taxes   or administrative   expenses.166   In the normal   case   where   the   decedent’s   will provides   that   taxes   and   expenses   are   payable   out   of the residuary   estate, specific   legatees   of stock   (including   a spouse   receiving   a bequest   eligible for the   unlimited   marital   deduction)   are   not   eligible   to use   Section   303.  Distributions   of Appreciated   Property.   The   most   likely   asset   for   a  Section   303   redemption   is   cash,   but   a   corporation   that   distributes appreciated   property   to redeem   its shares   must   recognize   gain under   the now   familiar   rule   in Section   311(b).  PROBLEM  George   died   last   year   and   his   gross   estate   is   $14,000,000.   George’s estate   expects   to   incur   a   total   of   $600,000   of death   taxes   and   allowable deductions   for expenses   and   losses   under   §§ 2053   and   2054.   George’s   gross  estate   includes   stock   in X   Corporation   (fair market   value—$1,200,000)   and Y   Corporation   (fair market   value—$2,400,000).   The   fair market   value   of all of the outstanding   X and Y   stock   is $8,400,000   and   $9,600,000,   respectively.  George’s   wife, Adele,   also   owns   $1.200,000   of X stock.   (She   and   George   held  a total   of $2,400,000   of X stock   as   tenants-in-common   during   his life.)  If   Y   Corporation   redeems   shares   from   George’s   estate,   will   the redemption   qualify   for exchange   treatment   under   § 303?  165   JT.R.C. § 303(b)(4).  166   T.R.C.   § 303(b)(3).

CHAPTER   6  STOCK   DIVIDENDS   AND  SECTION   306   STOCK  A.   INTRODUCTION  Code:   Skim   §§ 305;   306;   317(a).  It   should   be   evident   by   now   that   Subchapter   C   has   been   the  backdrop   for a continuing   cops   and   robbers   saga.   The   goals of the robbers  are   clear   enough,   even   if their   methods   may   be a bit obscure.   When   they  ran   out   of ideas   to avoid   the   double   tax,   the   robbers   shifted   their   focus   to  bailing   out   corporate   earnings   at the   least   tax   cost.   The   cops   were   quick to respond,   but   they   sometimes   lacked   direction   and   even   were   known   to engage   in isolated   acts   of police brutality.   Nowhere   does   this drama   have a richer   history   than   in the   area   of stock   dividends   and   Section   306   stock. But   for   many   of   these   skirmishes,   the   operative   word   may   now   be “history,”   at   least   as   long   as   dividends   and   long-term   capital   gains   are taxed   at the   same   preferential   rate. The   evolving   plot is best   appreciated   by first putting   the underlying transactions   into perspective.   A   k dividend   is simply   a distribution   of  stock   (or rights   to   acquire   stock)!   by a   corporation   to some   or   all of its  shareholders.   the   distributed   stock   is   of   the   same   class   as   the shareholder’s   underlying   holdings,   a stock   dividend   is similar   to what   is known   as   a   “stock   split.”   The   only   difference   is that   a   stock   dividend  requires   the corporation   to transfer   an   appropriate   amount   from   retained earnings   to   paid-in   capital   while   a   stock   split   usually   increases   the  number   of outstanding   shares   without   any   adjustment   to the   corporate  capital   account.?   A stock   dividend,   however,   need   not be of the   same   class  of   stock   as   the   shareholder’s   existing   interest   in   the   corporation. Preferred   stock   may   be distributed   with   respect   to common   or vice versa,  and   more   complex   capital   structures   present   the   opportunity   for  countless   variations. Stock   dividends   accomplish a variety of business objectives. Some public companies periodically   pay   small “common on common” stock  dividends   instead of cash   ostensibly to provide their shareholders   with  some tangible   evidence of   their   interest in corporate   earnings   while  1 TLR.C. § 305(d)(1)   defines   the term “stock” to include   rights to acquire   such stock. 2 A “reverse”   stock split decreases the number of shares   outstanding.   Apart   from the  financial accounting distinctions,   the line   of demarcation   between a stock dividend   and a stock split usually is drawn   by the   relationship of  the number of shares   distributed to the  previously outstanding shares.   To   better   inform   shareholders,   the   rules   of  the New York   Stock Exchange  provide   that a distribution   of   less than   25   percent of  the   shares   outstanding prior to the distribution will   be a stock   dividend.   Larger   distributions (e.g., distributions   of  one   share for each   share   held)   are   labelled   splits. New   York   Stock   Exchange   Listed Company   Manual,  § 703.02.  297

298  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  allowing the corporation to retain cash for use in the business. Although  these distributions may have an incidental impact on the price   of the stock, they are more of a shareholder public   relations gesture than an  event of any financial consequence. Stock splits often are prompted by a desire to increase the number of outstanding shares and thus reduce the price   per share in an attempt to increase the marketability (and market  value) of the stock on a listed exchange by making it more attractive to  smaller investors.  The   business   objectives   may   be different   in the case   of a closely held corporation.   In that   setting,   stock   distributions   frequently   are   a vehicle  to shift   corporate   control.3   To   illustrate,   assume   that   all the   outstanding  stock of Family   Corporation   is owned   by Mrs.   Older   and   has   a fair market  value   of $1,000   per   share.   Mr.   Younger,   Older’s   son,   has   been   employed by Family   for several   years   and   Older   expects   to gradually   shift   control  of the business   to Younger.   Older’s   plan   faces   several   obstacles.   Gifts   of Family   common   stock   to Younger   may   not   be desirable   because   Older   is unwilling   to part   with   that   much   wealth   or   the   gift tax   liability   may   be prohibitive.   Younger   also may   not be able to afford   a significant   purchase  of stock   from   his   mother   because   the   current   price   of   Family   common stock   is too high. As   an   alternative,   Family   might   distribute   a new   class   of preferred  stock   to   Older.   The   preferred   stock   could   be   structured   with   dividend  rights   and   a liquidation   preference   so   that   its value   absorbs   most   of the net   worth   of the   company,   leaving   the   common   stock   with   only   nominal  value.   The   distribution   of preferred   stock   to Older   will be tax-free‘   and,  since   the value   of the common   stock   will be substantially   reduced,   Older more   easily   may   shift   control   to Younger   through   gifts   or   even   sales   of  common   stock.5  The tax consequences of the   stock distribution to Older in   our  example are governed   by Section 305, which generally   provides that  gross income does not include a distribution of stock by a corporation to  its shareholders with   respect to its stock. This   exclusion, however, is  subject to various   exceptions, the most important of which are found in  Section 305(b). Consequently, the   applicability of the   Section   305(b) exceptions is the critical inquiry in analyzing the   tax consequences of a  stock   distribution. These   exceptions are examined more closely   in   the next   section   of  this chapter. It   is sufficient for now to note   that   the preferred stock   distribution to Older is not a taxable   stock   dividend.  What do  you   suppose is the   rationale for that   result?  ’ A recapitalization   frequently is an   alternative method for making   adjustments to the  corporation's   capital   structure.   In   certain   situations, a recapitalization may provide   more favorable   income tax   results, See   Chapter 11, infra.  *   LR. § 305(a). The   preferred stock, however,   would   be   Section   306   stock assuming  Family   has   earnings   and profits. See   Section   C of this chapter, infra.  * But see   I.R.C.   §§ 2701 et   seq., which limits   the   estate   planning   advantages of this  strategy.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  Lest   we   forget the cops   and   robbers   saga,   there   is one   other   aspect   of the   previous   example   to consider.   Recall   that   Older   owns   100   percent   of the   outstanding   Family   common   stock,   and   Family   makes   a   tax-free  distribution   of a   new   class   of preferred   stock   to   Older.   Assume   further that   Family   has   ample   earnings   and   profits.   If   Older   retained   her common   stock   rather   than   giving   it   to   her   son,   the   preferred   stock  distribution   historically   provided   her   with   an   opportunity   for   tax  avoidance.   She   could   sell the   preferred   stock   to Facilitator   for cash   and,  after   a   short   period   of time,   the   corporation   could   redeem   the   preferred  stock,   paying   Facilitator   an   appropriate   premium   for the   shares.   When  the   dust   settled,   this   series   of   transactions   had   virtually   the   same  economic   effect   as   a cash   distribution   by Family   to Older:   Older   has   cash  in hand,   Family’s   corporate   treasury   has   been   depleted,   and   Older   still  owned   100   percent   of the   company.   But   the   tax   consequences   appeared to   be   dramatically   different.   Rather   than   being   stuck   with   a   taxable  dividend,   Older   hoped   to enjoy   “sale”   treatment   on   the   disposition   of the preferred   stock   to   Facilitator.   A sale   enabled   Older   to recover   her   basis  in   the   preferred   stock   and   to   recognize   a   long-term   capital   gain   to   the extent   the   amount   realized   on   the   sale   exceeded   her   basis.§   A   closer  examination   reveals   that   this   potential   loophole   (is it still?)   was   closed  by   Section   306,   which   was   the   legislative   response   to   Older’s   tax  avoidance   plan—the   so-called   “preferred   stock   bailout.”   In   our   simple  example,   the   preferred   stock   will   bear   the   taint   of “Section   306   Stock,”  and   Section   306(a)(1)   will   characterize   Older’s   amount   realized   on   the  sale to Facilitator   as ordinary   (dividend?)   income.’   The   last section   of this  chapter   explores   the   details   of Section   306   and   evaluates   its continuing  significance.  B.   TAXATION   OF   STOCK   DIVIDENDS   UNDER   SECTION   305  Code:   §§ 305(a)—(d);   307;   312(d)(1)(B),   (f)(2);   1223/4).  Regulations: §§ 1.305—1, —2,  —3(a), (b), (c), (e) Examples (1)—-(4),   (8), (10) &   (11), —4, —5(a),   —6, —7(a);   1.3807-1.  The current scheme for taxing stock   distributions is  a distant   cousin  of statutes fashioned   during the infancy of  the income tax and is the product of a checkered legislative   history. The Revenue Act of 1916  provided that a “stock dividend shall be considered   income, to the amount  of its cash value.”8   In   1920,   the Supreme Court   considered the  6 This assumes that Older   had a long-term   holding   period in the Family common stock,  which could   be  tacked in determining the holding   period of  the  preferred. I.R.C. § 1223(5).  7 LR.C. § 306(a)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A). Prior to the enactment of Section   306 as part  of  the   1954  Code,   the   Service argued that   in substance   these   transactions   were   equivalent to   a cash distribution. The   argument   met   with   sporadic success. Compare   Chamberlin v. Commissioner,  207   F.2d   462   (1953), cert. denied,   347   U.S.   918,   74   S.Ct. 516   (1954),   with   Rosenberg v.

Eisner,   245   U.S.   418,   38  S.Ct.   158   (1918),   the  Supreme   Court   concluded   that   a   stock   dividend   was   not “meome” or “dividends”   under   the  Revenue   Act   of 1913.  299

300   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  constitutionality   of   this   provision   in   Eisner   v.   Macomber.9   Mrs.  Macomber,   a common   shareholder   of a corporation   with   no   other   class   of stock   outstanding,   received   a   proportionate   distribution   of   additional  common   stock.   The   Supreme   Court   held   that   the   distribution   was   not  taxable   because   it did   not   constitute   “income”   within   the   meaning   of the  16th   Amendment   to   the   Constitution.   Although   the   Court’s  constitutional   commentary   has   been   discredited,!®9   the   result   in Macomber   is eminently   logical   and   has   been   codified   in   Section   305(a). Whatever   reshuffling   may   occur   in   the   corporation’s   capital   account,   a  common-on-common   stock   dividend   does   little   more   than   crowd   the  shareholder’s   safe   deposit   box   (or   brokerage   account)   with   additional  stock   certificates   or   book   entry   shares   evidencing   the   same   ownership interest   held   before   the   distribution.  An~obedient Congress swiftly responded to the Supreme Court’s  interpretation of the 16th Amendment with a primitive   declaration that  stock dividends “shall not be  subject to tax.”!! The stock dividend terrain  remained calm until the Supreme Court generated a minor   tremor in  1936   with its decision in Koshland v. Helvering.!2 Corinne   Koshland, a  shareholder who   owned cumulative   nonvoting preferred stock, received  a distribution of voting common stock. She subsequently disposed of her preferred stock and asserted that   she was entitled to use   the stock’s full cost basis in determining her gain. Since the   prior common stock  distribution was received tax-free, the Service contended that a  proportionate amount of Mrs. Koshland’s basis in her preferred   shares should be   allocated to the common, thereby   increasing the gain on the disposition of her preferred stock. The Supreme Court   agreed   with the  shareholder’s   contention   and in the course of its opinion   shed additional light  on the meaning of Hisner v. Macomber:13  Although Eisner v. Macomber affected only the taxation of dividends   declared in the same stock as that presently   held by the taxpayer, the Treasury gave the   decision a broader interpretation which   Congress followed in the Act of 1921. Soon after the passage of that   Act, this court pointed out   the distinction between a stock dividend which   worked no change in the corporate entity, the same interest in the same corporation being   represented after the   distribution by   more shares of precisely   the same character, and   such a dividend where there  had either been   changes of corporate   identity or   a change in the  nature of   the shares   issued as dividends whereby the  9 252 U.S.   189, 40 S.Ct. 189   (1920). ae tng Bittker & Eustice, Federal Income   Taxation of Corporations   and   Shareholders 1 Revenue Act of  1921, § 201(d).  12 298   U.S.   441,   56  S.Ct. 767   (1936). 8 298   U.S. at 445—46,   56  S.Ct.   at 769-70 In Helvering v.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  proportional interest of the stockholder after the distribution  was essentially different from his former interest. Nevertheless  the successive statutes and Treasury regulations   respecting taxation of stock dividends remained unaltered. We give great  weight to an administrative interpretation long and consistently followed, particularly when the Congress, presumably.with that  construction in mind, has reenacted the  statute without change.  The question here, however, is not merely of our adopting the  administrative construction but whether it should be adopted if  in effect it converts an income tax into a capital levy. We   are   dealing   solely   with   an   income   tax   act.   Under   our decisions   the   payment   of a   dividend   of new   common   shares, conferring   no   different   rights   or interests   than   did the old—the new   certificates,   plus   the   old,   representing   the   same  proportionate   interest   in the net   assets   of the corporation   as   did  the   old—does   not   constitute   the   receipt   of   income   by   the stockholder.   On   the   other   hand,   where   a   stock   dividend   gives  the stockholder   an   interest   different   from   that which   his former  stock   holdings   represented   he   receives   income.   The   latter   type  of   dividend   is   taxable   as   income   under   the   Sixteenth  Amendment.   Whether   Congress   has   taxed   it as of the time   of its receipt,   is immaterial   for present   purposes.  Koshland   at   least   educated   Congress   on   the   subtleties   of taxing stock   dividends,   but the legislators   were   not yet up to the task of devising a precise   statutory   solution.   Instead,   they   tossed   the   ball   back   into   the judiciary’s   court   by   providing   in   the   Revenue   Act   of   1936   that   a distribution   of stock   or rights   to acquire   stock   was   not   to be treated   as   a  dividend   to   the   extent   it did   “not   constitute   income   to   the   shareholder  within   the   meaning   of the   Sixteenth   Amendment   to the   Constitution.”!4 The   Supreme   Court   declined   the   invitation   to   reconsider   Kisner   v.  Macomber,   preferring   to   develop   a   “proportionate   interest   test,”   under  which   a   stock   dividend   was   taxable   if it   increased   a   shareholder’s  proportionate   interest   in the   corporation.15  It was   back   to   the   drawing   board,   however,   with   the   enactment   of  the Internal   Revenue   Code   of 1954.   Seeking   a simple   approach,   Congress enacted   the   predecessor   of current   Section   305,   largely   as   an   expression  of   dissatisfaction   with   the   proportionate   interest   test.   A   far   more elaborate   system   was   adopted   in   the   Tax   Reform   Act   of   1969.   The  following   excerpt   of legislative   history describes   the   1954   Code   provisions  14 Revenue Act of  1936, § 115(f)(1). This test was carried   over to the   1939   Code.  15 See   the   legislative   history in  the   text   at p. 302, infra. See also Helvering v. Sprouse,  318   U.S.   604,   63 S.Ct.   791   (1943), where the Supreme Court   decided   that a pro  rata   distribution of nonvoting common stock to   a shareholder   owning voting common stock   was   nontaxable  because it did not change the   proportionate   interests   of  the   shareholders,   and   Strassburger v.  Commissioner,   318   U.S.   604,   63   S.Ct.   791   (1943), where the   Court   held   that a distribution   of  cumulative   nonvoting   preferred   stock   to   the   corporation’s   sole shareholder   was   not   taxable  because   “[bJoth   before   and   after  the   event   he  owned   exactly   the   same   interest   in  the net   value  of the  corporation   as  before.”   Id.  at 607,   63.S.Ct.   at 792.  301

302   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  and   explains   the   1969   amendments,   which   added   the key elements   of the  current   version   of Section   305.  Senate   Finance   Committee   Report  on   Tax   Reform   Act   of 1969  S.Rep.   No.   91-552,   91st   Cong.,   1st   Sess.   150-54   (1969).  Present   law.—In   its   simplest   form,   a   stock   dividend   is   commonly  thought   of as   a mere   readjustment   of the   stockholder’s   interest,   and   not  as   income.   For   example,   if   a   corporation   with   only   common   stock  outstanding   issues   more   common   stock   as a dividend,   no basic   change   is  made   in the position of the corporation   and   its stockholders.   No corporate  assets   are   paid   out,   and   the   distribution   merely   gives   each   stockholder more pieces of paper to represent the same interest in the corporation.  On the other hand, stock dividends may also be used in a way that  alters the interests of the stockholders.   For example, if  a corporation   with  only common stock outstanding declares a dividend payable at the  election of each   stockholder, either in additional common stock or in cash,  the stockholder who receives a stock dividend is in the same position as if he   received a taxable   cash dividend and purchased additional stock with the proceeds.   His interest in the corporation is increased relative to the interests of stockholders who took dividends in cash.  Present   law (sec. 305(a)) provides that if   a corporation   pays a  dividend to its shareholders in its own stock (or  in rights to acquire its stock), the shareholders are not required to include the value of the dividend in income. There are two   exceptions to this general rule.   First, stock dividends   paid in discharge of preference   dividends for the current or immediately preceding taxable   year are taxable. Second, a stock  dividend is taxable if any   shareholder may elect to receive his dividend  in cash or other property   instead of  stock.  These provisions   were   enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1954. Before   1954 the   taxability of stock dividends   was determined  under the “proportionate interest test,” which   developed out   of a series   of  Supreme Court cases, beginning with   Eisner y. Macomber, 252   U.S.   189 (1920) [T.D. 3010,   C.B, 3;  25]: In  these   cases   the Court held,   in general, that a stock dividend   was   taxable if  it increased   any   shareholder’s proportionate interest in the   corporation. The lower courts   often had difficulty   in applying the test   as formulated in these cases, particularly  where   unusual   corporate   capital   structures   were   involved.  Soon after  the proportionate interest test was   eliminated in  the   1954 Code,   corporations   began to develop methods   by   which   shareholders could,   in   effect, be   given a choice between receiving   cash   dividends or  increasing their proportionate   interests   in  the   corporation in much the  same   way as if they  had   received   cash   dividends   and   reinvested   them in  the   corporation.   [The   report   then   described   those   methods in detail   and  summarized   the  initial   response   of  the   Treasury   Department.   Ed.]

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  **E*  On January 10, 1969,   the Internal Revenue Service   issued final  regulations under   which a number of methods of achieving the effect of a cash dividend to some shareholders   and a corresponding increase in the  proportionate interest of other shareholders are brought   under the  exceptions in section 305(b), with the result that shareholders who  receive increases in proportionate interest are treated as receiving taxable distributions.  General   reasons   for change.—The   final regulations   * * * do not cover  all   of the   arrangements   by   which   cash   dividends   can   be   paid   to   some  shareholders   and   other   shareholders   can   be   given   corresponding  increases   in proportionate   interest.   * * *  Methods   have   also   been   devised   to   give   preferred   stockholders   the equivalent   of dividends   on   preferred   stock   which   are   not   taxable   as   such  under   present   law.   For   example,   a corporation   may   issue   preferred   stock for $100   per   share   which   pays   no   dividends,   but which   may   be redeemed  in   20   years   for   $200.   The   effect   is   the   same   as   if the   corporation distributed   preferred   stock   equal   to 5 percent   of the   original   stock   each year   during   the   20-year   period   in lieu   of cash   dividends.   The   committee  believes   that   dividends   paid   on   preferred   stock   should   be taxed   whether  they   are   received   in   cash   or   in   another   form,   such   as   stock,   rights   to  receive   stock,   or   rights   to   receive   an   increased   amount   on   redemption.  Moreover,   the   committee   believes   that   dividends   on   preferred   stock  should   be   taxed   to   the   recipients   whether   they   are   attributable   to   the  current   or immediately   preceding   taxable   year   or to earlier taxable   years. Explanation   of provisions.—The   bill continues   (in sec.   305(b)(1))   the provision   of present   law   that   a stock   dividend   is taxable   if it is payable  at the   election   of any   shareholder   in property   instead   of stock.  The   bill provides   (in sec.   305(b)(2))   that   if there   is a distribution   or  series   of distributions   of stock   which   has   the result   of the receipt   of cash or   other   property   by   some   shareholders   and   an   increase   in   the proportionate   interests   of other   shareholders   in   the   assets   or   earnings  and   profits   of the   corporation,   the   shareholders   receiving   stock   are   to be  taxable   (under   sec.   301).  For example, if a corporation   has   two classes   of common stock,   one paying   regular   cash   dividends   and the   other paying   corresponding stock  dividends   (whether in common or preferred stock), the   stock dividends  are   to be taxable.  On the   other   hand, if a corporation   has a single   class   of common stock and a class   of preferred   stock which   pays   cash   dividends   and is not  convertible,   and it distributes a pro-rata common stock   dividend   with respect to  its common stock,   the   stock   distribution is not  taxable   because the   distribution   does   not   have   the   result   of  increasing   the   proportionate interests   of  any   of the   stockholders.  303

304  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Indetermini isproportionate distribution, any  security convertible into stock or_any right to acquire stock is to be  treated   as   outstand]   ock.   For   example,   if a corporation   has   common  stock   and   convertible   debentures   outstanding,   and   it pays   interest   on   the  convertible   debentures   and   stock   dividends   on   the   common   stock,   there  is   a   disproportionate   distribution,   and   the   stock   dividends   are   to   be taxable   (under   section   301)_1n addition, in determining   whether meres  a disproportionate   distribution   with   respect   to a shareholder,   each   class  The   committee   has   added   two   provisions   to   the   House   bill   (secs.  305(b)(3)   and   (4))   which   carry   out   more   explicitly   the   intention   of the House   with   regard   to   distributions   of common   and   preferred   stock   on common   stock,   and   stock   distributions   on   preferred   stock.   The   first   of these   provides   that   if a   distribution   or   series   of distributions   has   the result   of the receipt   of preferred   stock by some   common   shareholders   and  the   receipt   of common   stock   by   other   common   shareholders,   all   of the shareholders   are   taxable   (under   sec.   301)   on   the   receipt   of the   stock.  The second of the provisions added   by the committee (sec. 305(b)(4)) provides that distributions of stock with respect to preferred stock are  taxable (under sec. 301). This   provision   applies to all distributions on preferred stock except   increases in the conversion ratio   of convertible preferred stock made solely to take account of stock dividends or stock  splits with respect to the   stock into which the convertible stock is convertible. The bill provides (in section   305(b)(5))   that a distribution of  convertible preferred stock is taxable (under sec. 301)   unless it is  established to the  satisfaction of the Secretary or his delegate that it will  not have the   result of a disproportionate distribution described above. For example, if a corporation makes a pro rata distribution on its common  stock of preferred stock convertible into common stock at a price   slightly higher   than the market price of the common stock on the   date of  distribution, and the period during   which the   stock must be converted is 4 months, it is likely that a distribution would   have the   result   of a  disproportionate distribution. Those   stockholders who wish to increase  their interests in the corporation would convert their   stock   into common  stock at the end of the 4-month period, and those stockholders who wish  to receive   cash would sell their   stock or have it redeemed. On the   other hand, if the   stock were   convertible for a period of 20  years   from the   date of issuance,   there would be a likelihood   that substantially all of the stock would be  converted into common stock, and   there would be no change in  the proportionate interest   of  the common shareholders.  The bill provides (in sec. 305(c))   that under   regulations   prescribed by the   Secretary or his   delegate, a change in conversion ratio, a change  in redemption price,   a difference between   redemption price and   issue price,   a redemption   treated as   a section   301   distribution, or any  transaction   (including a recapitalization)   having a   similar   effect   on   the

--- Page 375 ---

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  interest of any shareholder is to be treated as a distribution with respect  to each shareholder whose proportionate interest is thereby increased. The purpose of this provision is to give   the Secretary authority to deal  with   transactions that have the effect of distributions, but in which stock  is not actually distributed.  such   methods   as   increasing   the   ratio   at   which   his   stock,   convertible  securities,   or   rights   to   stock   may   be   converted   into   other   stock,   by  decreasing the   ratio at   which other stock, convertible securities, orrights  redemption   of stock   owned   by other   shareholders.   It is not   clear   under  present   law   to   what   extent   increases   of this   kind   would   be   considered  distributions   of stock   or rights to stock.   In order   to eliminate   uncertainty, the   committee   has   authorized   the   Secretary   or   his   delegate   to prescribe regulations   governing   the   extent   to   which   such   transactions   shall   be treated   as   taxable   distributions. For   example,   if a   corporation   has   a   single   class   of common   stock which   pays   no   dividends   and   a class of preferred   stock which   pays   regular  cash   dividends,   and   which   is convertible   into   the   common   stock   at   a  conversion   ratio that   decreases   each   year   to adjust   for the payment   of the cash   dividends   on   the   preferred   stock,   it   is   anticipated   that   the  regulations   will provide   in appropriate   circumstances   that   the   holders   of  the   common   stock   will be treated   as receiving   stock   in a disproportionate distribution   (under   sec.   305(b)(2)).  It   is   anticipated   that   the   regulations   will   establish   rules   for  determining   when   and   to   what   extent   the   automatic   increase   in proportionate   interest   accruing   to stockholders   as a result   of redemptions under   periodic   redemption   plan are   to be treated   as taxable   distributions.  A periodic   redemption   plan   may   exist,   for example,   where   a corporation  agrees   to redeem   a small   percentage   of each   common   shareholder’s   stock  annually   at the election   of the shareholder.   The   shareholders   whose   stock is   redeemed   receive   cash,   and   the   shareholders   whose   stock   is   not  redeemed   receive   an   automatic   increase   in their   proportionate   interests. However,   the committee   does   not   intend   that this regulatory   authority   is to   be   used   to   bring   isolated   redemptions   of   stock   under   the disproportionate   distribution   rule   (of sec.   305(b)(2)).   For   example,   a   30  percent   stockholder   would   not   be   treated   as   receiving   a   constructive  dividend   because   a 70 percent   stockholder   causes   a corporation   to redeem 15 percent   of its stock   from   him.

Advice   has   been   requested   whether   under   section   302(a)   of   the  Internal   Revenue   Code   of  1954   the   stock   redemptions   described   below  305

Corporation   Z has only one   class   of stock   outstanding.   The   Z common stock   is held   by 24 shareholders,   all of whom   are   descendants,   or spouses  of descendants,   of the   founder   of Z. In   1975,   when   Z had   6,000   shares   of common   stock   outstanding,   the  board   of directors   of Z adopted   a plan   of annual   redemption   to provide   a  means   for its shareholders   to   sell   their   stock.   The   plan   provides   that   Z will   annually   redeem   up   to 40   shares   to its outstanding   stock   at a price established   annually   by the   Z board   of directors.   Each   shareholder   of Z is   entitled   to   cause   Z   to   redeem   two-thirds   of   one   percent   of   the shareholder’s   stock   each   year.   If   some   shareholders   choose   not   to participate   fully in the   plan   during   any   year,   the   other   shareholders   can cause   Z to redeem   more   than   two-thirds   of one   percent   of their   stock,   up  to the maximum   of 40 shares.  Pursuant to the plan of annual   redemption, Z redeemed 40 shares of its stock in 1976. Hight shareholders participated in the redemptions. The following table shows the ownership interests of the Z shareholders  before and after the 1976 redemptions. [The table has been omitted. It shows that none of the 24 shareholders owned 13 percent or more of the corporation’s stock   before or after the redemption and, after the redemption, each   shareholder’s actual and constructive ownership was at least 97 percent of its ownership prior to the redemption. Ed.]  Issue   1  Section   302(a) of the Code provides that if  a corporation redeems its stock, and if section   302(b)(1), (2) or (3) apphes, the redemption will be treated as  a distribution in part or  full payment in exchange for the stock.  Section   302(b)(1) of the Code provides that   section   302(a) will apply  if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend.   Section 302(b)(2) provides that   section   302(a) will apply if the redemption is  substantially   disproportionate   with   respect to the shareholder unless the redemption is made pursuant to a plan the purpose or effect   of which, in  the aggregate, is not substantially   disproportionate   with   respect to the  shareholder.   Section   302(b)(3) provides that   section 802(a) will apply if all of the stock   of  the corporation owned   by the shareholder is redeemed.  Section   318(a)   contains rules   of constructive   stock ownership to be applied to those   provisions of subchapter   C to which   they are expressly  made applicable.   Section   302(c)(1)   provides,   with   an exception   not relevant   here,   that   the   constructive   ownership rules   of  section   318(a)  apply in determining the ownership of  stock   for purposes of  section   302.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  Section 302(d)   of the Code   provides   that a stock   redemption   to which  section   302(a)   does   not   apply   will be treated   as   a distribution   of property to which   section   301   applies.  None   of the redemptions   here   qualified   under   section   302(b)(3)   of the Code   because   all of the shareholders   who   participated   in the redemptions  continue   to own   stock   of Z. Moreover,   none   of the   redemptions   qualified  under   section   302(b)(2)   because   none   of   the   shareholders   who  participated   in   the   redemptions   experienced   a   reduction   in   interest   of  more   than   20   percent,   as   section   302(b)(2)(C)   requires.   Therefore,   the  first   question   is   whether   the   redemptions   were   “not   essentially equivalent   to a dividend”   within   the   meaning   of section   302(b)(1).  Section   1.3802—2(b)   of   the   regulations   provides   that   the   question  whether   a   distribution   in   redemption   of   stock   is   not   essentially equivalent   to a dividend   under   section   302(b)(1)   of the   Code   depends   on  the   facts   and   circumstances.  In United   States   v. Davis,   397   U.S.   301   (1970),   rehearing   denied,   397  U.S.   1071   (1970),   1970-1   C.B.   62,   the   Supreme   Court   of   the   United  States   said   that   for a redemption   to qualify   as   not   essentially   equivalent  to   a   dividend   under   section   302(b)(1)   of the   Code,   the   redemption   must  result   in   a   meaningful   reduction   of   the   shareholder's   proportionate  interest in   the corporation. The Court held that the business purpose of  é   redemption   is   irrelevant   to   this   determination   and   that   the  ownership   attribution   rules   of section   318(a)   apply. Several   of   the   shareholders   of Z   experienced   reductions   in   their proportionate   interests   in   Z   (taking   into   account   constructive   stock ownership   under   section   318   of   the   Code)   as   a   result   of   the   1976 redemptions.   If their   reductions   were   “meaningful,”   they   are   entitled   to  exchange   treatment   for their   redemptions   under   section   302(a).   Whether  the   reductions   in proportionate   interests   were   ‘meaningful’   depends   on  the facts-and Circumstances. aa ae  In this case, an important fact is that   the 1976 redemptions were not isolated occurrences but   were undertaken   pursuant to an ongoing   plan  for Z to redeem 40   shares of its stock each year. None of  the reductions  in proportionate interest experienced   by Z shareholders as a result   of the  76 redemptions was “meaningiul because   the reductions   were   small  and each shareholder has the power to recover the lost interest_by  electing  not to participate in the redemption plan in later   years. Accordingly,   none of  the 1976 redemptions qualified for exchange  treatment   under section   302(a)   of  the   Code. All  of  the redemptions are to  be treated as distributions   of property to which section   301   applies.  Issue   2  Section   305(b)(2)   of  the   Code   provides   that   section   301   will apply to a distribution   by a corporation   of its stock if the   distribution, or   a  series of   distributions   that   includes   the   distribution,   has   the   result   of   the receipt   of   property   by   some   shareholders,   and   increases   in   the  307

308  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  proportionate   interests   of other   shareholders   in   the   assets   or   earnings  and   profits   of the   corporation.  Section   305(c)   of the   Code   authorizes   regulations   under   which   a  redemption   treated   as   a   section   301   distribution   will   be   treated   as   a  section   301   distribution   to any   shareholder   whose   proportionate   interest  in the earnings   and profits or assets   of the corporation   is increased   by the  redemption.  Section   1.305—7(a)   of the   Income   Tax   Regulations   provides   that   a  redemption   treated   as   a section   301   distribution   will generally   be treated  as   a distribution   to which   sections   305(b)(2)   and   301   of the   Code   apply   if  the   proportionate   interest   of any   shareholder   in the   earnings   and   profits  or   assets   of the   corporation   deemed   to have   made   the   stock   distribution is   increased   by   the   redemption,   and   the   distribution   has   the   result described   in section   305(b)(2).   The   distribution   is to be   deemed   made   to any   shareholder   whose   interest   in the   earnings   and   profits   or   assets   of the   distributing   corporation   is increased   by the   redemption. Section   1.305-3(b)(3) of the regulations   provides that for a distribution of property to meet the requirements of section   305(b)(2) of the Code, the distribution must be made to a shareholder in the capacity as   a shareholder   and must be a distribution to which section 301 [or one  of several   other specified   sections]   applies. A distribution of property incident to an   isolated redemption will not cause section   305(b)(2) to apply even though the redemption distribution is treated as   a section 301 distribution.  Section   305 of the Code does not make the constructive stock  ownership rules of section 318(a) applicable to its provisions.  The 16 shareholders of Z   who did   not tender   any stock for redemption in 1976 experienced increases in their proportionate interests of the earnings   and profits and assets of Z (without   taking into  account   constructive stock ownership   under section 318 of the Code)   asa  result of the redemptions.   Shareholders B and X, who   surrendered small  amounts of  their stock for redemption in 1976, also experienced increases  in  their proportionate interests. The 1976 redemptions were not   isolated  but were undertaken   pursuant to an ongoing   plan of annual stock  redemptions. Finally,   the 1976 redemptions are to be   treated as  distributions of property to which section   301 of the Code applies.  Accordingly, B, X and the   16 shareholders of Z   who did   not  participate in the 1976 redemptions are deemed to have   received   stock  distributions to which sections   305(b)(2) and 301 of  the Code apply.   See  examples (8) and (9) of  section   1.305—8(e) of the  regulations for  a method  of computing the amounts of  the deemed distributions.  NOTE  . Collateral   Tax   Consequences.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  depend   upon   whether   or   not   the   distribution   is taxable   to the   shareholders.  Taxable   distributions   are   governed   by the   rules   in Section   301.   The   amount  of the   distribution   is the   fair   market   value   of the   stock.16   The   shareholder  takes   a   fair   market   value   basis   in   the   distributed   stock,   and   his   holding  period   runs   from   the   date   of the   distribution.!7   The   distributing   corporation recognizes   no   gain   or   loss   under   Section   311(a)(1),   and   it may   reduce   its earnings   and   profits   by the   fair market   value   of the   distributed   stock.18 If   a   stock   distribution   is   nontaxable   under   Section   305(a),   the  shareholder   must   allocate   the basis   in the stock held prior to the distribution  between   the   old   and   new   stock   in   proportion   to   the   relative   fair   market  values   of each   on   the   date   of distribution,!®   and   the holding   period   of the old shares   may   be tacked   on   in determining   the holding   period   of the distributed stock.2°   The   distributing   corporation   recognizes   no   gain   or   loss   on   the distribution   of its stock?!,   and   it may   not   reduce   its earnings   and   profits.??  Stock   Rights   Distributions.   Section   305   also   governs   distributions   of stock   rights   (sometimes   called   warrants).   Public   companies   occasionally issue   rights   to   acquire   additional   stock   at   a   favorable   price   as   a   means   of  raising   equity   capital.2*   Like   stock   dividends   generally,   rights   distributions  are   not   taxable   unless   they   come   within   one   of   the   Section   305(b)  exceptions.”4   In the   case   of a nontaxable   rights   distribution,   Section   307(a) generally   requires   an   allocation   of basis   between   the   underlying   stock   and the rights   in proportion   to their relative   fair market   values   on   the date   of the  distribution.25   In   most   cases,   however,   such   an   allocation   is   unnecessary  because   of an   administrative   convenience   exception   in Section   307(b),   which  provides   that   the   rights   shall   take   a zero   basis   if their   fair market   value   is  less than   15 percent   of the value   of the stock   with   respect   to which   they were distributed.   Taxpayers   with   time   on   their hands   (or the incentive   to make   an  allocation)   may   elect   to   use   the   allocation   method   prescribed   in   Section  307(a).26   Taxable   rights   distributions   are   treated   as   Section   301 distributions;   as   such,   their   value   (if any)   is a dividend   to the   extent   of the distributing   corporation’s   earnings   and   profits.  16 Reg. § 1.305—1(b)(1).   This rule also applies to corporate   shareholders.   Reg. § 1.301— 1(d)(1)(ii). In the   case   of noncorporate shareholders,   taxable stock dividends may be “qualified”  and eligible for the preferential rates under Section 1(h)(11).  17   Reg.   § 1.301—1(h).  18   Reg.   § 1.312-1(d). 19   1-R.C.   § 307(a);   Reg.   § 1.307-1.  20   T.R.C.   § 1223(4). =   21   J.R.C.   § 311(a)(1). 22   T.R.C.   § 312(d)(1)().  23 See, e.g., Rev.   Rul. 72-71,   1972-1 C.B. 99.  24 See   LR.C. § 305(d)(1), which treats   rights as “stock” for purposes of Section 305.  25 But the   regulations   permit this   allocation   only if the   rights   are exercised (in which  event   the basis   allocated to the   rights is added to the   cost   of  the new stock   acquired) or   sold.   If  the   rights   simply lapse,   the   shareholder   recognizes   no   loss but   the   basis   returns to the  underlying stock.   Reg.   §  1.307—1(a).  26   1.R.C.   § 307(b)(2).  309

ry  310   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  PROBLEMS  1.   Hill   Corporation   is organized   with   two   classes   of voting   common   stock:  Class   A   and   Class   B.   Shares   in each   class   of stock   have   an   equal   right   to  ioe   es   Hill’s   assets   and   earnings   and   profits.   Frank   owns   100   shares   of Class   A  , Vas yo   stock,   and   Fay   and   Joyce   each   own   50 shares   of Class   B stock.  ns   Assuming   that   Hill   Corporation   has   ample   earnings   and   profits,  determine   whether   the   following   distributions   are   taxable   under   § 301   or  Hl   excludable   under   § 305(a): (a)   A   pro   rata   distribution   of nonconvertible   preferred   stock   to  both   classes   of shareholders.  (b)   A pro   rata   distribution   of Class   A   stock   on   Class   A   and   Class B   on   Class   B.   The   Class   B   shareholders   also   are   given   the  option   to take   cash   in lieu   of additional   Class   B shares.   Joyce exercises   this   option.  (c) A pro   rata distribution of Class A stock on Class A and a cash  distribution on Class B.  () Assume that Class B is   a class   of nonconvertible preferred stock which pays   regular   cash dividends and Hill distributes Class B stock to the Class A shareholder.  (e) Same as (d), above, except that Hill distributes a class   of  nonconvertible preferred stock which has rights to assets and earnings   and profits subordinate to those of the existing   Class B stock (i.e., “junior” nonconvertible   preferred stock) to the  Class A shareholder.  (f) Assume that Hill has   only one class   of common stock  outstanding   and also has   issued a series   of 10 percent  debentures convertible into common stock at the rate   of one  share of common stock for each   $1,000   debenture. Hill makes an annual interest payment to the debenture holders and one  month later distributes a “common on common” stock dividend to the common shareholders   without   adjusting the conversion  ratio on   the debentures.  (g) Same as (f), above,   except that   the debentures are convertible preferred stock. The corporation   declares a one-for-one split on  the common stock (i.e., each shareholder receives   one new  share of common stock for each old share) and the conversion  ratio   of the preferred is doubled. (h) Assume again that   Class A and Class B are both classes   of  voting common stock.   Hill makes a pro   rata   distribution of Class A on Class A and a distribution of newly issued   shares  of nonconvertible   preferred   stock   on Class   B.  (i) Same as   (h), above,   except   that   the   preferred   stock which is distributed is convertible   into   Class B stock   over   20   years at  Class   B’s market price  on   the   day of  the   distribution.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  2.   Z   Corporation   has   one   class   of   common   stock   outstanding   held   by  unrelated   individuals   A (500 shares),   B (300 shares),   and   C (200 shares).   Will § 305(c)   create   any   tax   problems   if Z agrees   to redeem   annually   50 shares   of  stock   at the   election   of each   shareholder,   and   A   makes   such   an   election   for two   consecutive   years?  C.   SECTION   306   STOCK  1.   THE   PREFERRED   STOCK   BAILOUT  As   previewed   earlier   in this   chapter,   Section   306   is one   of several  provisions   in   Subchapter   C   that   are   much   less   significant   as   long   as dividends   and   long-term   capital   gains   of   noncorporate   taxpayers   are  taxed   at   the   same   preferential   rates.   The   specific   target   of Section   306  was   the   preferred   stock   bailout,   a   device   used   by   shareholders   in   the “good   old days”   to withdraw   corporate   earnings   at very   favorable   capital gains   rates.   In the   classic   transaction,   a profitable   C corporation   would  make   a   tax-free   distribution   of   preferred   stock   to   its   common  shareholders,   who   then   sold   the   preferred   stock   to   an   accommodating investor   (often   a   lightly-taxed   insurance   company)   and   reported   long- term   capital   gain   on   the   sale.   The   investor   collected   dividends   on   the preferred   stock   and,   a   few   years   later,   the   corporation   redeemed   the  preferred   stock   from   the   investor.   The   net   effect   was   the   receipt   of cash by   the   shareholders   on   the   sale   of the   preferred   stock   and,   after   the  redemption   from   the   investor,   there   would   be   no   reduction   of   their  proportionate   interest   in the   corporation. In   Chamberlin   v.   Commissioner,27   the   Service   contended   that   the  preferred   stock   dividend   was   taxable   as   ordinary   income   on   these   facts. The   Sixth   Circuit   disagreed,   using   language   dear   to   the   hearts   of  taxpayers:   “[t]he   general   principle   is well   settled   that   a taxpayer   has   the legal right to decrease   the   amount   of what   otherwise   would   be his taxes, or   altogether   avoid   them,   by   means   which   the   law   permits.”   The   court  found   that   the   buyer   of the   preferred   stock   (the “investor”)   made   a bona fide   investment,   the   preferred   stock   dividend   was   legally   paid,   the  subsequent   redemption   was   a   distribution   to   the   investor   (not   the common   shareholders),   and   nothing   in the statute   permitted   the common  shareholders’   gain   on   the   sale   of   the   preferred   stock   to   be   taxed   as  ordinary   income.  The   Chamberlin case was decidedunder the 1939   Code. Left  unchecked, the   court’s endorsement of  the preferred stock   bailout would have   encouraged other   closely   held   corporations to engage in   similar  profitable   end   runs around the   distribution rules. Although the result   in  Chamberlin possibly   would   have   been   overturned in subsequent litigation,   the Treasury   wisely   sought a prompt legislative   solution. The central   issue   facing   the   drafters   of  the   1954   Code   was   whether to attack  27 207   F.2d   462   (6th  Cir.   1953),   cert.  denied,   347   U.S.   918,   74  S.Ct.   516   (1954).  311

312   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  the   bailout   by   taxing   all   “preferred   on   common”   stock   dividends   or to defer the punishment   until the shareholder   disposed   of stock with bailout  potential.  Common   shareholders   who   receive   a   proportionate   preferred   stock  dividend   have   not   increased   their   interest   in   the   corporation.   They   ~ simply   have   a tax opportunity   which   they may   choose   to forego   for nontax  reasons.   For   example,   there   may   be valid   business   reasons   (e.g.,   a shift  of control   from   older   to younger   generation   shareholders)   for a preferred stock   dividend.   Recognizing   these   and   other   nontax   objectives   served   by  preferred   stock   dividends,   Congress   concluded   that   the   receipt   of   the  dividend   was   not   the   appropriate   occasion   for punitive   action.28   Instead, it chose   to label   stock   with   bailout   potential   as   “Section   306   stock”   and   to require   a shareholder   to report   ordinary   income   rather   than   capital   gain  when   Section   306   stock   is sold   or   redeemed.   In   the   case   of a   sale,   the  ordinary   income   amount   is generally   determined   by   the   amount   that would   have   been   a dividend   at the   time   of the   stock   distribution   if cash rather   than   stock had been   distributed.?9   In the case   of a redemption,   the  ordinary   Income   amount   is   determined   at   the   time   of   the   cash  distribution.39   Other   operational   and   planning   aspects   of Section   306   are  examined   below.  Whenever dividends and   long-term capital gains are taxed at the  same low rate, the advantages to be achieved   from a bailout of corporate  earnings at “capital gains rates” have diminished considerably. As with  redemptions and a few other classic bailout transactions to be   studied later, the only remaining tax advantages to noncorporate   shareholders of  a sale   of stock rather than a dividend are recovery of stock   basis and, in special   situations,   the ability to offset capital gains (but   not   qualified dividends)   with capital losses. Section   306 nonetheless remains in the Code, in an extended period of semi-hibernation until the   distinction  between dividends   and capital gains is restored or Congress decides   that  Section   306 is no longer   necessary. 2. THE   OPERATION OF SECTION 306  a. SECTION 306 STOCK   DEFINED  Code: § 306(c)—(e).  Regulations: § 1.306—3(a)—(c), (e).  The definition   of Section   306   stock is consistent   with the   original  anti-bailout   objectives of the   statute. The principal   category is stock distributed to   a shareholder as   a tax-free   stock dividend   under Section 305(a)—other   than “common on common.”31 Ordinarily, this is preferred  28 S.Rep.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK 313  stock   distributed   to common   shareholders   by a corporation   with   earnings  and   profits.   As   the   Chamberlin   case   illustrates,   preferred   stock   is the  primary   vehicle   for a bailout   because   it can   be   sold   without   diminishing  the   shareholder’s   control   or   right   to   share   in   future   corporate   growth. “Common”   stock   is excepted   because   it lacks   bailout   potential;   it may   not be   sold   without   diminishing   the   shareholder’s   control   and   interest   in  corporate   growth.32 Although   the   Service   has   not   defined   “common   stock”   for Section   306  purposes,   its published   rulings   focus   on whether a sale of the stock would  cause   a   reduction   of the   shareholder’s   equity   position   in   the   company.  The   fundamental   inquiry   is thus   whether   the   stock   has   a realistic   and  unrestricted   opportunity   to   participate   in   the   growth   of   corporate  equity.33 ieee  liquidation,   it is   not   “common”   stock   for   Section   306   purposes.34   But voting   common   stock   that   is   subject   to   the   issuing   corporation’s   first  refusal   right   to   purchase   the   stock   at   net   book   value   whenever   a  shareholder   wishes   to make a transfer   is common   stock   because,   upon   a  transfer,   the   shareholder   will   part   with   some   or   all of his   interest   in the  future   growth   of the corporation   vis a vis other   shareholders.*5 Congress   also   concluded   that   a tax-free   stock   dividend   issued   by a corporation   with   no   current   or   accumulated   earnings   and   profits   for the year   of the   distribution   has   limited   bailout   potential.   If cash   instead   of  stock   had   been   distributed,   the   shareholder   would   not   have   realized  ordinary   income   whenever   the   distributing   corporation   has   no   earnings  and profits.   Consequently,   Section   306   stock   does   not include   stock which would   not   have   been   treated   as   a dividend   at the   time   of distribution   if cash   had   been   distributed   in lieu of the   stock.36  To   prevent an easy purge of the taint, Section   306 stock includes stock with a transferred or substituted basis.37 This   category  encompasses stock received as   a   gift which takes a Section   1015 transferred basis, or stock   received in exchange for Section   306 stock in a tax-free Section   351   transaction.38 But the  exorcist prevails when stock  passes   from a decedent   and thus qualifies for a date-of-death basis under Section 1014.   In that  event,   the  Section   306 taint is buried   along with the  decedent   and her old  basis. An important but more specialized   category is stock (which is not common stock) received in a tax-free corporate   reorganization or division  32 See Walter, “ ‘Preferred Stock’ and ‘Common Stock’: The Meaning of  the Terms and the  ‘Importance of  the  Distinction for Tax   Purposes,” 5 J.

314   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  when   the effect of the transaction   is substantially   the same   as the receipt of a stock   dividend   or when   the   stock   is received   in exchange   for Section  306   stock.   For   example,   preferred   stock   received   by the   shareholders   of  the target   (i.e., acquired)   corporation   in a tax-free   merger   may   be a prime  candidate   for   Section   306   classification.   This   aspect   of Section   306   is  considered   in a later   chapter.®9  The   final   category   of Section   306   stock   was   added   by   Congress   to  thwart   the   use   of a   holding   company   to bail   out   earnings.   Assume,   for  example,   that   Schemer   holds   only   common   stock   in   Profitable   Co.  Finding   that   Section   306   presents   a substantial   roadblock   to a bailout,  Schemer   organizes   Holding   Co., exchanging   her Profitable   common   stock  for   newly   issued   Holding   common   and   preferred   stock   in   a   tax-free  Section   351   transaction.   At   one   time,   the   Holding   preferred   stock   would  not   have   been   Section   306   stock   because   Holding   had   no   earnings   and profits   at the time   of its incorporation.   This   offered   shareholders   the very  bailout   opportunity   that   Congress   was   trying   to prevent!   Schemer   could  sell the   Holding   preferred   stock   to   an   institutional   investor,   recovering her   basis   and   realizing   a   capital   gain,   and   the   stock   later   could   be  redeemed   by   the   corporation—all   without   losing   any   of her   control   or  share   in the   growth   of Profitable. Section 306(c)(3) blocks this maneuver by characterizing the preferred stock of Holding Co. (i.e., preferred stock acquired in a Section 351 exchange) as Section   306 stock if the   receipt of money instead of the  stock would have   been treated as   a dividend to any extent. Of course,  Holding Co. has no earnings   and profits so that a distribution of cash would not have   been a dividend. To make the   statute achieve its objective, Section   306(c)(3)(A) borrows the   rules   of Section   304 (relating to redemptions   through the   use   of   affiliated corporations).   In   our example, the Holding Co. preferred would be   Section   306 stock if  Profitable Co. has any   current or accumulated earnings   and profits. This  is because a cash payment by   Holding Co. for the Profitable common  stock would   have resulted in a dividend to Schemer under Section 304(a)(1).   In effect, this means that we look to the earnings   and profits   of  the   original corporation (Profitable   Co.)   in determining   whether the receipt of cash would   have   been a dividend.40 b. DISPOSITIONS OF SECTION 306 STOCK  Code: § 306(a). Regulations: § 1.306—1.  The tax consequences of a disposition of Section   306   stock   vary  depending on whether the   stock is sold or redeemed.   On a sale   of Section  306 stock,  the amount realized is treated as dividend   income to the  extent  39 See   Chapter 11, infra. 40 In testing   for  the   effect   of  a dividend,   the   Section   318   attributio i  > effect of ; n  rules   1  regard to  the   50  percent   limitation in Sections   318(a)(2)(C)   and   318(a)(8)(C).

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  of the   stock’s   “ratable   share”   of the   amount   that   would   have   been   a dividend   if the   corporation   had   distributed   cash   in an   amount   equal   to the   fair   market   value   of the   stock   at the   time   of the   distribution.‘   This rule   requires   the shareholder   to look back   to the time   of distribution   and determine   to what   extent   a cash   distribution   would   have   emanated   from  the   corporation’s   current   or   accumulated   earnings   and   profits   at   that  time.42   The   balance,   if   any,   of   the   amount   realized   is   treated   as   a  reduction   of the basis   of the   Section   306   stock,   and   any   excess   is treated as   gain   from   the   sale   or   exchange   of the   stock.43   Although   the   ordinary  income   amount   is treated   as   a dividend   received   from   the   corporation   to  allow   noncorporate   shareholder   to qualify   for the   preferred   rates   under  Section   1(h),   it is not   clear   if corporate   shareholders   are   eligible   for the Section   248   dividends   received   deduction,   or   whether   the   corporation   is  entitled   to   reduce   its   earnings   and   profits   when   Section   306   stock   is  sold.44   No   loss   may   be   recognized   if the   shareholder’s   adjusted   basis   in the   stock   exceeds   the   amount   realized,   and   any   unrecovered   basis   must  be allocated   back   to the stock   with   respect   to which   the   Section   306   stock was   distributed. A   shareholder   who   receives   a nontaxable   stock   dividend   of Section  306   stock   that   later   is redeemed   by the   corporation   has   used   two   steps   to  achieve   what   could   have   been   accomplished   in a single   transaction:   the withdrawal   of cash   from   the corporation.   To reflect   that reality   and   treat  the   transactions   as   a   single   event,   Section   306(a)(2)   provides   that   the  amount   realized   on   a   redemption   of Section   306   stock   is treated   as   a  Section   301   distribution,   taxable   as   a   dividend   (likely   a   qualified dividend)   to the extent   of the current   or accumulated   earnings   and profits in   the   year   of redemption.46   The   balance   of the   distribution,   if any,   is treated   as   a   reduction   of basis   and   then   capital   gain   under   the   rules generally   applicable   to nonliquidating   distributions.”  41   T.R.C.   §§ 306(a)(1)(A),   (a)(1)(D).  42 T.R.C. § 306(a)(1)(A). This   provision also applies to other nonredemption “dispositions” such as certain pledges of Section   306 stock where the pledgee can only look to the   stock as security   (an  unlikely scenario), but it does not apply to charitable   contributions of Section   306  stock. Reg. § 1.306—-1(b)(1); Rev. Rul. 57-328,   1957-2 C.B.   229. For   charitable deduction purposes, however, a taxpayer who contributes   appreciated Section   306 stock to   a qualified  donee must reduce the fair market value of the donated stock by the amount that would   have  not have   been   long-term capital gain if the   stock had   been sold rather   than   donated.   See I.R.C.  § 170(e)(1)(A); Pescosolido v. Commissioner, 91 T.C.   52  (1988).  43   T.R.C.   § 306(a)(1)(B).  44 Section   306(a)(1)(D)   provides that any amount treated as ordinary   income on a sale   of  Section   306 stock   shall be treated as a dividend “[flor purposes of  section   1(h)(11) and   such   other  provisions as the Secretary shall   specify *  *  * .” As of early   2019,   the Treasury had not yet  “specified”   and, until it does, it appears that  corporate   shareholders may not  claim   the dividends  received   deduction,   and no earnings   and profit reduction is authorized on a sale   of Section   306 stock. See   Reg. § 1.312-1(e), which says   there is no adjustment to the earnings   and   profits of  the   issuing   corporation   upon a disposition   of  Section   306   stock   unless   such   disposition is a  redemption. 45 T.R.C. § 306(a)(1)(C);   Reg. § 1.306—1(b)(2) Example (8).  46   T.R.C.   § 306(a)(2).  47   See   I.R.C.   § 301(c)(2),   (8).  315

316  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  c.   DISPOSITIONS   EXEMPT   FROM   SECTION   306  Code:   § 306(b).  Regulations:   § 1.306-2.  Section   306   is aimed   only   at bailouts,   and   not   every   disposition   of   .  Section   306   stock   presents   that   opportunity.   For   example,   a shareholder  who   sells   her   entire   interest   in a corporation   (including   her   Section   306  stock)   is not   withdrawing   corporate   earnings   while   preserving   control.  She   is   engaging   in   a   transaction   that   easily   could   have   qualified   for capital   gain   treatment   irrespective   of any   prior   stock   dividend.   Section 306(b)(1)   thus   provides   that   the   punitive   general   rule   of Section   306(a) shall   not   apply   to   nonredemption   dispositions   if   the   shareholder completely   terminates   her   interest   in   the   corporation   and   does   not dispose   of the stock   to a related   person   within   the   Section   318   attribution  rules.48   A   similar   exception   is provided   for   redemptions   of Section   306  stock   that   result   in a complete   termination   of the   shareholder’s   interest  under   Section   302(b)(3)   or   qualify   as   a partial   liquidation   under   Section  302(b)(4).49  Other exempt dispositions include: (1) redemptions of Section   306  stock in a complete liquidation;59 (2) dispositions   that are treated as  nonrecognition transactions,   such as tax-free Section   351 transfers,  contributions to capital and the like;5! and (3) distributions coupled   with subsequent dispositions or redemptions of Section   306 stock if the taxpayer satisfies the Service that either: (a) the distribution and subsequent disposition or redemption, or (b) in the case   of a prior or  simultaneous disposition of the underlying common stock, just the  disposition or redemption,   was not made pursuant to a plan having tax  avoidance as one of its principal   purposes.52  Although Section   306 is aimed primarily at closely held companies,  the   Service’s hard line position is that holders of Section   306 stock issued  by public companies are not automatically entitled to relief under the “no tax avoidance”   exception in Section 306(b)(4).53 The “no   tax avoidance”  exception is explored in the Fireoved case, which follows.  ‘8   For   purposes   of d   ini   es  Section   318   attrition rasan,   TRE   ate   Py emanate.   deans   Hones  49   LR.C.   § 806(b)(1)(B). 50   LR.C.   § 306(b)(2). 51   T.R.C.   § 806(b)(3). 52   L.R.C.   § 806(b)(4).  53 Rev.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  Fireoved   v.   United   States  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Third   Circuit,   1972.  462   F.2d   1281.  a ADAMS,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE.  This   appeal   calls   into   question   the   application   of section   306   of the  Internal   Revenue   Code   of   1954   and   the   “first   in-first   out   rule”   to   a redemption   of preferred   stock   in   a   corporation   by   plaintiff,   one   of its  principal   shareholders.   In particular   we   are   asked   to decide   whether   the  transaction   here   had   “as   one   of its principal   purposes   the   avoidance   of  Federal   income   tax,”   whether   a prior   sale   of a portion   of the   underlying common   stock   immunized a like   proportion   of the   section   306   stock   from  treatment   as   a   noncapital   asset,   and   whether   another   block   of   the  redeemed   stock   should   be   considered   to   represent   stock   not   subject   to  section   306. I.   Factual   Background  On   November   24,   1948,   Fireoved   and   Company,   Inc.   was  incorporated   for   the   purpose   of printing   and   selling   business   forms.   At  their   first   meeting,   the   incorporators   elected   Eugene   Fireoved,   his wife,  Marie,   the   plaintiffs,   and   a   nephew,   Robert   L.   Fireoved,   as   directors   of  the   corporation.   Subsequently,   the   directors   elected   Eugene   Fireoved   as President   and   Treasurer   and   Marie   Fireoved   as   Secretary.   The  corporation   had   authorized   capital   stock   of 500   shares   of $100   par   value non-voting,   non-cumulative   preferred   stock   and   100   shares   of   $1   par  value   voting   common   stock.   On   December   31,   1948,   in consideration   for  $100   cash,   the corporation   issued   Eugene   Fireoved   100   shares   of common  stock;   for   $500   cash,   it issued   him   five   shares   of preferred   stock;   and   in  payment   for automotive   equipment   and   furniture   and   fixtures,   valued   at  $6,000,   it issued   him   an   additional   60   shares   of preferred   stock. In   1954, when Mr.   Fireoved   learned that his nephew, Robert, was  planning to leave   the business,   he began discussions   with Karl  Edelmayer and Kenneth Craver   concerning the   possibility   of combining  his business   with their partnership,   Girard   Business   Forms, that had been printing and selling business   forms for some time prior to 1954. Messrs.   Fireoved, Edelmayer and   Craver   agreed that   voting control   of the new enterprise   should   be   divided   equally among the   three of them. Because Mr.   Fireoved’s   contribution to capital would be approximately  $60,000   whereas the partnership could   contribute   only   $30,000, it was decided   that   preferred stock should   be   issued to Mr.   Fireoved to  compensate for the   disparity.   In furtherance of  this   plan,   the   directors and   shareholders of Fireoved   and   Company, in  late 1954   and early   1955, held   several   meetings at which the   following   corporate   changes   were accomplished:   The   name of  the company was   changed to Girard   Business  Forms;   the   authorized   common stock   was   increased   from   100 to 300  shares   and   the   authorized   preferred   stock   was   increased to 1000   shares; Mr.   Fireoved   exchanged   his   100   shares   of common   and   65   shares   of  317

318   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  preferred   stock   for   equal   amounts   of the   new   stock;   an   agreement   of  purchase   was   authorized   by which   the company   would   buy   all the   assets  of the   Edelmayer-Craver   partnership   in return   for 200   shares   of common and   298   shares   of preferred   stock;   and   Mr.   Fireoved   was   issued   535 shares   of the   new   preferred   stock   as   a   dividend®   on   his   100   shares   of   .  common   stock,   thereby   bringing   his   total   holding   of preferred   stock   to  600   shares   to indicate   his   $60,000   capital   contribution   compared   to the  $29,800   contributed   by the   former   partnership. As   the   business   progressed,   Mr.   Edelmayer   demanded   more   control  of the   company.   In response,   Mr.   Fireoved   and   Mr.   Craver   each   sold   24  shares   of common   stock   in the   corporation   to him   on   February   28,   1958. On   April   30,   1959,   the   company   redeemed   451   of Mr.   Fireoved’s   600 shares   of preferred   stock   at $105   per   share,   resulting   in net   proceeds   to  him   of $47,355.7   The   gain from   this   transaction   was   reported   by Mr.   and Mrs.   Fireoved   on   their   joint   return   for   the   year   1959   as   a   long   term  capital   gain.   Subsequently,   the   Commissioner   of   Internal   Revenue (Commissioner)   assessed   a deficiency   against   the Fireoveds   of $15,337.13 based   on the   Commissioner’s   view   that the proceeds   from   the redemption  of   the   451   shares   of   preferred   stock   should   have   been   reported   as  ordinary   income   and   the   tax   paid   at that   rate   based   on   section   306.   Mr.  and   Mrs.   Fireoved   paid the   assessment   on   March   14,   1963,   but   on   March  10,   1965,   filed   a claim   for a refund   with   the   Commissioner. After   the Commissioner disallowed the refund claim on March 8,  1966,   the Fireoveds instituted   the present action against the United  States on August 4, 1967   seeking a refund of the $15,337.13 plus interest on the ground that   the transaction came within an exception to section 306, and that they were therefore entitled to report   the income as   a long term capital   gain. The case was tried to the   court without a jury on stipulated facts.   It  is from the district court’s determination,   318 F.Supp. 138,   on October 29, 1970,   that $8,885.50   should be refunded to the taxpayers that both parties   appeal. II. Background of  Section 306 Because we are the first court of appeals   asked to decide questions  of law pursuant to section   306, it is appropriate that we first examine the  circumstances that led to the  inclusion in 1954 of  this section in the   Code.  Generally, a taxpayer will benefit monetarily if he is able to report income as  a long  term capital gain rather   than as ordinary   income. Under normal   circumstances a cash   dividend   from a corporation   constitutes ordinary   income to the shareholder   receiving   such   money.   Therefore, it  would be to the advantage of a shareholder if  a method could   be   devised by which the money could   be distributed to him,   that would   otherwise   be 6 At   the   time   Mr.   Fireoved   received   his   stock   dividend,   the com   h earnings   and profits   of $52,993.06. sacar sitet 7 In   1959,   the company   had   accumulated   earnings   and profits   of  $48,235.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  paid   out   as   cash   dividends,   in a form   that   would   permit   the   shareholder to report   such   income   as   a long term   capital   gain. A temporarily   successful   plan for converting   ordinary   income   to long term   capital   gain   is described   by the   facts   of Chamberlin   v.   C.I.R.,   207  F.2d   462   (6th Cir.1953).   * * *  The   legislative   reaction   to   the   Chamberlin   decision   was   almost  immediate,   resulting   in the   addition   of section   306   to the   1954   Code,   in  order   to prevent   shareholders   from   obtaining   the   tax   advantage   of such bail-outs   when   such   shareholders   retain   their   ownership   interests   in the  company.  **¥*  Based   on   the history   of section   306   and   its plain   meaning   evidenced  by the provisions,   it is not   disputed   that the   535   shares   of preferred   stock  issued   to Mr.   Fireoved   as a stock   dividend   in 1954   were   section   306 stock.  Additionally,   it is clear   that   in   1959,   when   the   company   redeemed   451 shares   of Mr.   Fireoved’s   preferred   stock,   the general   provisions   of section 306   aside   from   the   exceptions—would   require   that   any   amount   realized by Mr.   Fireoved   be taxed   at ordinary   income   rates   rather   than   long term capital   gain   rates,   because   the   company   had   earnings   at   that   time   of $48,235   more   than   the   $47,355   required   to redeem   the   stock   at $105   per  share.  Thus,   the   questions   to   be   decided   on   this   appeal   are   (1) whether  certain   of the   exceptions   to   section   306   apply   to   permit   the   Fireoveds’  reporting   their   gain as a long term   capital   gain,   and   (2) whether   65 of the  451   shares   redeemed   are   not   section   306   stock because   of the first in-first  out   rule   of Treasury   Regulation   § 1.1012-1(c)   [the   court’s   analysis   and  holding   on   the   second   issue   has   been   omitted.   Ed.]. Il. Was the distribution of the stock dividend “in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes   avoidance of  Federal   income tax?”  Mr.   Fireoved asserts   that   the   entire transaction   should fall within  the exception   established by section   306(b)(4)(A), which provides: “If it is  established to the   satisfaction of the Secretary or his delegate * *  * that the   distribution, and the   disposition or redemption   *** was not   in  pursuance of a plan  having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal   income tax,” then the general rule   of section   306(a) will not  apply. As a threshold   point on   this   issue,   the Government maintains that because Mr.   Fireoved   never attempted to obtain a ruling   from the  “Secretary or his delegate”   the redemption   should   be  covered   by section 306(a), and the   district   court   should not have   reached the   question  whether the   exception   applied to Mr.   Fireoved.   Mr.   Fireoved   urges   that the   district   court   had   the power to consider   the   matter   de   novo,   even without a request   by   the   taxpayer to   the   Secretary or   his   delegate. Because   the  ultimate   result   we   reach   would   not be altered   by whichever  319

320   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  of these   two   courses   we   choose,   we   do not resolve   this potentially   complex  procedural   problem. 1° The   district   court,   based   on   the   assumption   that   it had   the   power   to decide   the   question,   found   that   although   one   of the   purposes   involved   in  the   issuance   of the   preferred   stock   dividend   may   have   been   business related,   another   principal   purpose   was   the   avoidance   of Federal   income  tax.  Mr.   Fireoved’s   analysis   of the   facts   presented   in   the   stipulations  would   reach   the   conclusion   that   the   sole   purpose   of the   stock   dividend  was   business   related.   He   relies   heavily   on   that   portion   of the   stipulation  which   describes   why   the   decision   was   made   to combine   his business   with  the   Edelmayer-Craver   partnership:   “The   partnership   could   provide   the additional   manpower   which   the expected   departure   of Robert   L. Fireoved from   the   Corporation   would   require.   Additionally,   the   partnership needed   additional   working   capital   which   the   Corporation   had   and   could  provide.”   Based   primarily   on   the   latter   sentence,   Mr.   Fireoved   asserts  that   the   district   court   had   no   choice   but   to find   that   the   transaction   was business   related   and   that   it therefore   had   no   avoidance   incentive. In making this argument, however, Mr. Fireoved overlooks the plain import of the language of section 306(b)(4). Whether the   section requires  the   decision to be made by the Secretary or the district court, it is clear that   “one of [the] principal purposes” of the   stock dividend   was not for  “the avoidance of Federal income tax.” The stipulation demonstrates no more   than that   the reorganized company required more capital than  could   be supplied by the partnership alone. The stipulation is completely  in harmony with the following fact situation: After   the partnership   was  combined with the corporation, the business   required the $30,000  contributed by the partnership   and all of the $60,000   Mr.   Fireoved had  in the corporation. Mr.   Fireoved   decided to take   the stock dividend   rather  than to distribute   the cash to himself as   a dividend, and   then to make a  loan to the corporation of the necessary money because if he   took   the  cash, he would subject himself to taxation at ordinary income rates.  Therefore “one of the   principal purposes” of the   stock dividend would be for “the avoidance of Federal income tax.”  In a situation such as the   one presented in  this   case, where the facts  necessary to determine the motives for the issuance of a stock dividend  are peculiarly   within the   control   of the taxpayer, it is reasonable to  require   the taxpayer to come   forward   with the   facts  that would relieve him of his liability. Here the   stipulation   was   equivocal in determining  the purpose of  the dividend   and is quite compatible   with   the thought that “one of  the   principal   purposes”   was   motivated   by “tax avoidance.” We  FA ; ore :  For   the   same   reason,   we   do  not   decide   this   issue in Part II,  infra.

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK  hold then that   the district court did   not err in refusing to apply the exception created by section   306(b)(4)(A).11 IV.   Did the prior   sale   by Mr.   Fireoved   of 24%   of his underlying   common  stock   immunize   such portion   of the section   306 stock   he redeemed   in 1959? The   district   court   construed   section   306(b)(4)(B)   to   mean   that   any  time   a   taxpayer   in   Mr.   Fireoved’s   position   sells   any   portion   of   his  underlying   common   stock   and   later   sells or redeems   his section   306   stock,  an   equivalent   proportion   of the   section   306   stock   redeemed   will   not   be  subject   to the provisions   of section   306(a).   The   Government   has   appealed  from   this   portion   of the   district   court’s   order   and   urges   that   we   reverse it, based   on   the   history   and   purpose   of section   306   and   the   particular facts   here.  The   stipulations   indicate   that,   “On   February   28,   1958,   Fireoved   and  Craver   each   sold   24   shares   of   common   stock   in   the   corporation   to  Edelmayer,”   and   that   appropriate   stock   certificates   were   issued.   From this   fact,   Mr.   Fireoved   reasons   that   his   sale   of 24   of his   100   shares   of common   stock   was   undertaken   solely   for   the   business   purpose   of  satisfying Mr.   Edelmayer’s   desire   for more   control   of the corporation,   and  therefore   he   should   be   given   the   benefit   of   section   306(b)(4)(B).   In  addition,   Mr.   Fireoved   contends   that   the   disposition   of his   section   306  stock   was   related   to   a   business   purpose   because   he   used   part   of the  proceeds   to pay   off a $20,000   loan   that   the company   had   made   to him.  Mr.   Fireoved   has   the   same   burden   here   of showing a lack   of a tax  avoidance   purpose   that   he   had   in section   III   supra.   It is clear   from   the  limited   facts   set forth in the   stipulations   that he has   not established   that the   disposition   of 24%   of the   535   shares   of the section   306   preferred   stock he   owned   “was   not   in pursuance   of a plan   having   as   one   of its principal purposes   the   avoidance   of   federal   income   tax.”!2   More   important, however,   is   that   an   examination   of   the   relevant   legislative   history  11 It is important to note   that apparently both   Mr.   Fireoved, in prosecuting this action for  a refund, and the Government, in its defense, assumed that if the   distribution and redemption  of the preferred stock were not controlled by § 306(a), the gain would be subject to taxation asa long term capital   gain. This is not necessarily the  case at all. Whether or not § 306 governs the transaction, it nonetheless involves a redemption of stock by a corporation to which § 302   could apply. Under the tests set out in §  302(b)—the relevant one of which   appears to be § 302(b)(1)— Mr.   Fireoved, who had the burden of  proof, may well have   been   unable to show that   the redemption was not “essentially equivalent to  a dividend.” United States v. Davis,   397   U.S.   301,  90 S.Ct. 1041,   25 L.Ed.2d 323 (1970). We hold, however, that it is now too   late   for the  Government to raise this  issue.  Z 12 Consistent   with   Mr.   Fireoved’s sale   of 24   shares of common stock in 1958   could have  been his knowledge that one   year later he would be  selling  his section 306 stock and a desire   on  his part to avoid   taxation at ordinary   income rates. As  noted later in  the  opinion,   the  sale of  just  24  shares   was   enough so that  he retained effective control—in the form of  veto power—over the corporation.   Moreover, the fact that   Mr.   Fireoved   needed   $20,000 of  the proceeds to pay off  a  loan to the   corporation   would not meet his burden.   The   proceeds of  the redemption totaled $47,355.   Thus,   although   $20,000 of  the redemption   may not have   been to avoid   taxes, we   can  ascribe   no purpose   other   than   tax   avoidance to the receipt   of  the   additional   $27,355.   Therefore,  since   one   of  the   principal   purposes   of the   redemption of  451   shares   of  preferred   stock   was   “the avoidance   of  Federal   income tax,”  Mr.   Fireoved   may not  take   advantage of §  306(b)(4)(B)   for any part   of the   redemption.  321

--- Page 392 ---

322   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  indicates   that   Congress   did not   intend   to give capital   gains   treatment   to a portion   of the   preferred   stock   redeemed   on   the   facts   presented   here. It   is   apparent   from   the   reaction   evinced   by   Congress   to   the Chamberlin   case,   supra,   that   by   enacting   section   306   Congress   was particularly   concerned   with   the   tax   advantages   available   to persons   who   —  controlled   corporations   and   who   could,   without   sacrificing   their   control,  convert   ordinary   income   to long   term   capital   gains   by the   device   of the preferred   stock   bail-out.   The   illustration   given   in   the   Senate   Report which   accompanied   section   306(b)(4)(B)   is helpful   in determining   the sort  of transactions   meant   to be exempted   by section   306(a):  Thus   if a shareholder   received   a distribution   of 100   shares  of   section   306   stock   on   his   holdings   of   100   shares   of   voting common   stock   in   a   corporation   and   sells   his   voting   common stock   before   he disposes   of his section   306   stock,   the   subsequent disposition   of   his   section   306   stock   would   not   ordinarily   be considered   a tax   avoidance   disposition   since   he   has   previously parted   with   the   stock   which   allows   him   to   participate   in   the ownership   of the   business.   However,   variations   of the   above  example   may   give   rise   to tax   avoidance   possibilities   which   are  not   within   the   exception   of   subparagraph   (B).   Thus   if   a corporation   has   only one   class   of common   stock   outstanding   and  it   issues   stock   under   circumstances   that   characterize   it   as  section   306   stock,   a   subsequent   issue   of   a   different   Class   of common   having   greater   voting   rights   than   the   original   common will   not   permit   a   simultaneous   disposition   of the   section   306  stock   together   with   the   original   common   to   escape   the   rules   of subsection   (a) of section   306.  Thus, it  is reasonable to assume that Congress realized   the general lack of a tax avoidance   purpose when a person sells all of  his control in a  corporation and then either simultaneously or subsequently disposes of  his section 306 stock. However, when only a portion of the underlying  common stock is sold, and the taxpayer retains   essentially all the   control he had previously, it would be   unrealistic to conclude that Congress  meant to give   that taxpayer the advantage of section 306(b)(4)(B) when  he  ultimately sells his section 306 stock. Cf. United States v. Davis,   397  U.S.   301,   90 S.Ct. 1041,   25 L.Ed.2d 323   (1970).  Shortly after Fireoved’s   corporation   had   been combined with the Kdelmayer-Craver partnership, significant changes   to the by-laws   were made.   The   by-laws   provided that corporate   action   could   be   taken   only  with   the unanimous consent of all the   directors.   In  addition,   the by-laws  provided that   they   could   be amended either by a vote   of 76% of  the  outstanding common shares or   a unanimous vote   of  the   directors. When  the  businesses   were   combined in late   1954,   each of  the   directors   held  of   the   voting   stock, thereby   necessitating a unanimous vote   for amendment to  the  by-laws.   After   Messrs.   Fireoved   and   Craver   each   sold 24 shares   of common stock   to Mr.   Edelmayer,   Mr.   Fireoved   held   254% of

--- Page 393 ---

CHAPTER 6 STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SECTION 306 STOCK 323  the common (voting) stock, Mr. Craver 254% and Mr. Edelmayer 49%%.  It is crucial to note   that   the by-laws   provided for a unanimous vote for  corporate action, and after the common stock   transfer,   the by-laws   were  capable of amendment only by a unanimous vote because no two  shareholders could vote more than   74%4% of the common stock and 76%  of the common stock was   necessary for amendment. Thus, although Mr. Fireoved did sell   a portion of  his voting stock prior to his disposition of  the section 306 stock, he   retained as much control in the corporation following the sale of  his common stock as he had prior to the sale. Under  these circumstances it is not consonant with the history of the legislation  to conclude that Congress intended such a sale   of underlying common stock to exempt the proceeds of the disposition of section 306 stock from  treatment as ordinary income.   Accordingly, the district court erred when  it held that any of the preferred   shares   Mr. Fireoved redeemed were not  subject to section 306(a) by virtue of section   306(b)(4)(B).14  KR KK  PROBLEMS Prete)  1.   Inyear   one,   Argonaut   Corporation   distributed   nonconvertible   nonvoting  preferred   stock.worth   $1,000   to   each   of its   two   unrelated   equal   common   CON  shareholders,   Jason   and   Vera.   The   Argonaut   common   stock   owned   by each  of the shareholders   had a basis   of $2,000   prior to the distribution   and   a value  of $3,000   immediately   after   the   distribution.   At   the   time   of the   distribution,  Argonaut   had   $2,000   of earnings   and   profits.   In year   three,   Argonaut   had  $3,000   of earnings   and   profits.

We express  no  view  on the situation   in which less than all the  voting shares   are   sold  but  enough are   disposed of  to  relinquish   effective   control   prior  to  or  simultaneous   with   the sale of section   306   stock.

CHAPTER   7  COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  A.   INTRODUCTION  We   have   been   present   at the   creation   of a corporation   and   nurtured the   corporate   entity   as   it engaged   in distributions,   redemptions,   partial  liquidations   and   maneuvers   to   mitigate   the   double   tax.   This   chapter shifts   the   focus   to the   end   of a C corporation’s   life cycle. A   few   definitions   are   in order   to   set   the   stage.   The   Code   does   not define   “complete   liquidation,”   but   the   regulations   provide   that  liquidation   status   exists   for tax purposes   “when   the corporation   ceases   to be a going concern   and   its activities   are   merely   for the purpose   of winding up   its affairs,   paying   its   debts,   and   distributing   any   remaining   balance  to its   shareholders.”!   Legal   dissolution   under   state   law   is not   required  for the   liquidation   to be   complete,   and   a transaction   will be   treated   as   a  liquidation   even   if the corporation   retains   a nominal   amount   of assets   to pay   any   remaining   debts   and   preserve   its legal existence.” Liquidations   often   are   preceded   by   a   sale   of substantially   all of a corporation’s   assets   and   a   distribution   of   the   sales   proceeds   to   the shareholders   in   exchange   for   their   stock.   Alternatively,   the   buyer   of a corporate   business   may   acquire   all the   stock   of the   target   company   and  either   keep   the   old   corporation   alive   or   cause   it to   be   liquidated.   But  liquidations   do not necessarily   involve   sales.   The   corporation   simply   may  distribute   its assets   in kind   to the   shareholders,   who   either   may   sell the  assets   or   continue   to operate   the   business   outside   of corporate   solution.  Or a parent   corporation   may   wish   to rearrange   its holdings   by liquidating or selling the   stock   of a subsidiary.  All these transactions raise challenging tax  issues at the shareholder  and corporate levels. Historically, individual shareholders   have hoped to  emerge from a complete liquidation or the sale   of a profitable corporate  business by realizing a capital gain on   their   stock   and, on an installment sale, by deferring   recognition of   the gain until cash payments are received. At the corporate level, the   goals   generally   have   been to avoid  recognition of gain on a distribution or sale   of  assets while   providing the  shareholders (in  a liquidation) or the purchaser (in an   acquisition)   with  a   fair market value   basis   in  the   distributed or acquired assets. At one  ‘time, most of  these   objectives   could   be met   with   careful planning,   but liquidations of  profitable companies   became far more   expensive after  the  Tax   Reform Act   of 1986   This   chapter   surveys   the   current   landscape,  considering first the   general   shareholder   and   corporate level   tax 1 Reg. § 1.332-2(c).   This   regulation   technically   applies   only to the   liquidation   of   a subsidiary,   but it has   long  been   assumed to apply   also  to ordinary   liquidations. 2 See, e.g., Rev.   Rul.   54-518,   1954-2   C.B.   142.  325

Later   chapters   will  consider   the   closely   related   topic   of   taxable   acquisitions   of   corporate  assets   or   stock,   tax-free   acquisition   techniques   known   as   corporate  reorganizations,   and   the   carryover   of   tax   attributes   following   an  acquisition.  B.   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS   UNDER   SECTION   331  1.   CONSEQUENCES   TO   THE   SHAREHOLDERS  Code:   §§ 331;   334(a);   346(a);   453(h)(1)(A)—(B). Regulations:   §§ 1.331—1(a),   (b), (e); 1.453—11(a)(1),   (2)(),   (8), —11(d).  The   complete   liquidation   of a corporation   presents   an   opportunity   to revisit   several   policy   issues   that   recur   throughout   the   study   of  Subchapter   C.   Consider   the   appropriate   tax   consequences   to   Owner,   a  sole   shareholder   of   X   Corporation,   who   desires   to   liquidate   X   and  continue   to operate   its business   as   a proprietorship.   Assume   that   X has  been   profitable   and   has   ample   earnings   and   profits   at   the   time   of its liquidation.   From   Owner’s   standpoint,   should   the   liquidation   be   treated as:   (1)   a   nonrecognition   transaction   akin   to   an   incorporation,   (2)   a dividend   distribution,   (3)   an   exchange   of the   stock   for   the   distributed  assets   or (4) some   combination   of the   above?  If Owner continues to operate the business as a sole proprietorship,  the liquidation results in a mere change in the form of  his investment. Since Congress   granted   nonrecognition   treatment to Owner   when he transferred the business into corporate solution, is it not also appropriate  to treat the  transfer of those assets back into Owner’s   hands asa tax-free  event?   This analogy has a superficial appeal but Congress has   never seriously considered it except in very   limited   situations.4 Nonrecognition  is inconsistent   with the double tax regime of Subchapter   C   because it would facilitate the   tax-free   bailout of earnings   and profits. Moreover, many complete liquidations   involve   the sale   of a business   followed by a  distribution of the cash   proceeds to the shareholders. Cash distributions do not lend themselves to a nonrecognition   regime   because it   is  impossible to assign money the substituted basis   that would be necessary  to preserve the shareholder’s   gain for recognition at a later   time.  Similarly, any   attempt to preserve the liquidated   corporation’s earnings and profits in the hands of its former   shareholders   would be cumbersome and   inconsistent   with the termination of  the  corporation.  A stronger case   can   be made for treating a liquidating   distribution  as   a dividend to the   extent of  the   corporation’s remaining   earnings   and profits. Because   earnings and_   profits disappear on a complete  liquidation,   this   is the   last chance to tax a shareholder’s   withdrawal of ’ See   Chapters 8, 9, and 12, infra.  4 See, e.g., I.R.C. § 332,   discussed   in  Section   C of this   chapter,   infra.

CHAPTER 7 COMPLETE LIQUIDATIONS  corporate profits as ordinary income. By triggering the distribution rules of Sections   301 and 316, this approach   would focus on the source of the liquidating distribution   rather than the shareholder’s relationship to his  investment. Dividend treatment, however, is inconsistent   with Section  302, which treats a distribution in redemption as an exchange if the  shareholder   completely   terminates or substantially   reduces his interest  in the corporation. Why should a complete   termination of the interests of  all the shareholders be   treated any less favorably? Moreover, if  liquidating distributions were treated as dividends to the extent of the  corporation’s earnings   and profits, a shareholder’s stock   basis might never be recovered.  The   redemption   analogy   suggests   a   third   approach,   which   would treat   a   complete   liquidation   as   a   sale   of stock   by the   shareholder.   This solution   is imperfect,   if only because   it ignores   the   disappearance   of the earnings   and   profits   account,   a clean   sweep   that   does   not   occur   on   a sale  of   stock.   But   after   a   period   of   waffling,>   Congress   opted   to   treat  liquidations   as   exchanges,   an   approach   that   permits   shareholders   to avoid   the   dividend   sting   and   be   taxed   at   capital   gains   rates.   Congress concluded   that   the   dividend   threat   was   “preventing   liquidation   of many  corporations”   because   of the   high   tax   cost   it imposed   and   therefore   was  generating   only   minimal   revenue.®   It regarded   exchange   treatment   as  “consistent   with   the   entire   theory   of the   [Code]”   and   as   “the   only method * * * which   can   be easily   administered.”” The   Congressional   policy   is   codified   in   Section   331(a),   which provides   that   amounts   received   by a shareholder   in complete   liquidation are   treated   as   full payment   in exchange   for the   shareholder’s   stock.   The vast   majority   of shareholders   hold   their   stock   as a capital   asset   and   thus will   recognize   capital   gain   or   loss   in an   amount   equal   to the   difference between   (1) the money   and   the fair market   value   of the property   received and   (2) the shareholder’s   adjusted   basis   in the stock   surrendered.   Section 334(a)   provides   that   the   shareholder’s   basis   in property   distributed   by a  corporation   in a complete   liquidation   that   is taxable   at the   shareholder  level   shall   be   the   fair   market   value   of the   property   at   the   time   of the  distribution.  Computation of a shareholder’s   gain or loss  on a complete liquidation is ordinarily a straightforward affair. The shareholder’s amount realized is the money and the fair market value of all other property   received   from the  liquidating   corporation. If a shareholder   assumes corporate liabilities or  receives   property   subject to  a  liability  in a liquidating   distribution,   the amount realized is limited to the   value of  the property received,   net   of liabilities. In keeping   with   the principles   of  the Crane case, however, it  is  6 Liquidations   were first treated as exchanges in  the Revenue Act   of  1924. Congress  changed its mind briefly from   1934 to 1936   and   then   reinstated   the  present   system.  6 HR.Rep. No.   2475,   74th   Cong.,   2d  Sess.

328  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  assumed   that   the   distributee   shareholder   will   pay   the   liabilities   and   he  thus   obtains   a full fair market   value   basis   in the   property   under   Section  334(a).  Shareholders   who   hold   several   blocks   of stock   with   different   bases  and   acquisition   dates   must   compute   their   gain or loss   separately   for each  block   rather   than   on   an   aggregate   basis.§   This   method   generally   makes a   difference,   however,   only   when   some   shares   are   held   long-term   and  others   short-term;   otherwise,   the   tax   consequences   will   be   identical whether   the   shareholder   uses   a   share-by-share   or   an   aggregate  approach.?  The   timing   of a shareholder’s   gain   or   loss   on   a complete   liquidation raises   thornier   questions.   A   liquidating   corporation   often   is unable   to distribute   all of its property   at one   time   or within   the   same   taxable   year. Recognizing   these   practical   constraints,   Section   346(a)   defines   a  complete   liquidation   to include   a series   of distributions   occurring   over   a period   of time   if they   are   all pursuant   to a plan   of complete   liquidation.  Shareholders   normally   prefer   to   treat   these   “creeping   complete”  liquidations   as   open   transactions   so   they   can   defer   reporting   any   gain until   the   amounts   received   exceed   their   stock   basis.1°   This   cost   recovery  approach   has   been   sanctioned   by the   Service   in the   liquidation   context!  even   though   it would   appear   to   be   foreclosed   by   Section   453,   which  requires   ratable   basis   recovery   as   payments   are   received   even   in cases where   the   selling price cannot   be readily   ascertained.!2   Since   hquidating distributions   are   treated   as   payments   in exchange   for the   shareholders’  stock,   Section   453   technically   seems   to   apply   and,   if so,   shareholders  wishing   to   defer   their   gain   should   be   required   to   use   the   installment  method,   allocating   each   distribution   between   recovery   of   basis   and  taxable   gain.!3   But   taxpayers   who   choose   to   use   the   cost   recovery  8 Reg. § 1.331—1(e). For example, assume that Shareholder (“S”) holds   60 shares of X,  Inc. stock long-term with a $30,000 basis and 40 shares short-term with a $50,000 basis. If §  receives $100,000 in complete liquidation of X, he must allocate   the amount realized ratably  between the two blocks as follows:  Long-Term   Short-Term 60   shares   40   shares  AR.   $60,000   AR.   $40,000 A.B.   30,000   A.B.   50,000  LTCG $30,000 STCL $10,000  _* For the problems of valuation of the liquidating   distribution and   handling   contingent claims, see Bittker & Eustice, Federal Income   Taxation of Corporations & Shareholders  4 10.22/2).  _ 10 See,   eg., Burnet v.

CHAPTER 7 COMPLETE LIQUIDATIONS  approach are not likely to be challenged in light   of the   Service’s  longstanding position in published rulings. A   different   issue   is presented   when a   liquidating   corporation   sells certain   assets   for   installment   obligations   and   then   distributes   the obligations   in complete   liquidation.   In that   situation,   shareholders   who  receive   the   installment   obligations   may   be   able   to   defer   part   of their  Section   331(a)   gain   on   the   liquidation   by using   the   installment   method of   reporting   under   Section   4538.   Installment   sale   reporting   is accomplished   by   treating   the   shareholders’   receipt   of payments   on   the  distributed   installment   obligations   as   if they   were   received   in exchange for   the   shareholder’s   stock.14   To   qualify   for   this   treatment,   the  obligations   must   have   been   acquired   by the   corporation   in respect   of a sale   or   exchange   of property   during   the   12-month   period   beginning   on  the   date   a   plan   of complete   liquidation   is adopted   and   the   liquidation  must   be   completed   within   that   12-month   period.'5   Installment obligations   arising   from   the   sale   of inventory   or   other   “dealer”   property by the corporation   are   eligible for installment   sale treatment   in the hands of the distributee   shareholders   only if the obligation   resulted   from   a bulk  sale—i.e.,   the   sale   was   to   one   person   in   one   transaction   and   involves  substantially   all of the property   attributable   to a trade   or business   of the corporation.!6   Installment   sale reporting   is not   available,   however,   if the stock   of   the   liquidating   corporation   is   publicly   traded,”   or   if   the  shareholder   elects   out   of Section   453.18  PROBLEM  A   owns   100   shares   of   Humdrum   Corporation   which   he   purchased several   years   ago   for   $10,000.   Humdrum   has   $12,000   of   accumulated earnings   and   profits.   What   are   the   tax   consequences   to A on   the   liquidation  of Humdrum   Corporation   in the following   alternative   situations: (a) Humdrum distributes $20,000 to A in exchange for his stock?  should not apply when a shareholder of a public company receives a series   of distributions straddling   two or more taxable years. See also I.R.C. § 453(d), which   permits a taxpayer to “elect  out”   of installment sale treatment. In  the case   of a liquidation,   an   election   out would require the  shareholder to report his entire gain in the  year of the first distribution except, perhaps, where  the value of future   distributions is unascertainable.   See   Reg. § 15A.453—1(d). 144 T.R.C. § 453(h)(1)(A);   Reg. § 1.453-11. A shareholder who receives liquidating  distributions   that   include installment obligations in more   than one taxable   year must  reasonably   estimate the gain   attributable to distributions   received in each   taxable   year based  on   the   best   available information   and allocate   his stock   basis   pro   rata   over all payments to be  received. When the   exact amount of gain is subsequently   determined,   any adjustment is made  in the  taxable   year in which that determination is made. Alternatively,   the shareholder may file  an amended return for the  earlier   year.   I.R.C. § 453(h)(2);   Reg. § 1.453-11(d).  16   Td. See   Reg.   § 1.453-11(¢).  16 L.R.C. § 453(h)(1)(B);  Reg. § 1.453-11(0)(4). 17 LR.C.   § 453(k)(2);   Reg. § 1.453-11(a)(2)@).   But if  a nonpublicly   traded   liquidating corporation   distributes   an   installment   obligation   arising   from a corporate-level sale   of  publicly  traded   stock,   the   obligation   generally   qualifies   for installment sale   reporting   under   Section  453(h).

Would   there   be   any  problem   if Humdrum   does   not   adopt   a formal   plan   of complete liquidation   in year   one?  (c)   Humdrum   distributes   $8,000   cash   and   an _ installment  obligation   with   a   face   and   fair   market   value   of   $12,000,  payable   $1,000   per year   for 12 years   with   market   rate   interest.  The   installment   obligation   was   received   by   Humdrum   two  months   ago,   after   the   adoption   of the   plan   of liquidation,   on  the   sale   of   a   capital   asset.   Would   the   result   be   different   if  Humdrum’s   stock   were   publicly   traded?   See   I.R.C.   § 453(k).

Compare   this   with   the   result   if  the   judgment   had   been   rendered   and   paid   by the   corporation  prior to the liquidation.   See Arrowsmith   v.

It should come as no surprise at this juncture that Subchapter   C requires property distributions by corporations to their shareholders to  be analyzed at both the corporate and   shareholder levels. Earlier chapters   have chronicled the gradual erosion of the General Utilities19  doctrine, under   which a corporation   generally did   not recognize   gain on  nonliquidating distributions of appreciated property. We have seen   that recognition of gain (but   not loss) is now the statutory norm in the  nonliquidation setting.2° Should the same rules apply to liquidating distributions and sales of  assets by a liquidating   corporation? Once again,  a brief  historical interlude is appropriate before considering the current answers to what was once a debated question.  a.   BACKGROUND  Although the General Utilities case involved a distribution of appreciated   property   by an ongoing business,   the  doctrine also applied to liquidating   distributions.   Until   the enactment of the 1986   Code, a corporation   generally did not recognize   gain or loss  on the  distribution of property in complete liquidation.21   Prior to the 1954   Code,   however, sales of  assets by a liquidating   corporation   were fully  taxable.  19 General Utilities &   Operating Co. vy. Helvering,   296   U.S. 200, 56   S.Ct   185 (1935);  Chapters   4D1   and   5E1,   supra. saiciche  208 LR.CS 81a ah).  ve IR.C.   § 836(a)   (pre-1987).   This   general   nonrecognition rule   was   subject to various  exceptions,   such as  the   statutory   recapture   of  depreciation   provisions   and   the judicially   created

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  To illustrate   the   disparate   tax treatment   of liquidating   distributions and   sales   under   the   pre-1954   regime,   assume   that   A   is   the   sole  shareholder   of Target   Corporation   (“T”)   and   has   a $100,000   basis   in her T stock.   T’s only   asset   is a parcel   of undeveloped   land   (“Gainacre”)   with  a fair market   value   of $400,000   and   a zero   adjusted   basis.   Purchaser   (“P”)  wishes   to acquire   Gainacre   for $400,000   cash.   If T distributed   Gainacre to   A   in   complete   liquidation,   it recognized   no   gain   under   the   General  Utilities   doctrine,   and A took   Gainacre   with   a $400,000   fair market   value  basis.   On   a sale   of Gainacre   to P for $400,000   following   the   liquidation,  A thus   would   recognize   no   gain.   If, instead,   T had   sold   Gainacre   directly to P, it would   have   recognized   $400,000   gain under   the   pre-1954   regime. In either   case,   A recognized   gain on   the liquidation   of T, measured   by the  difference   between   the   amount   of   the   distribution   and   her   $100,000  adjusted   basis   in the T stock.  The   different   tax   results   of   these   economically   equivalent transactions   prompted   savvy   taxpayers   to “postpone”   sales   of corporate assets   until   after   a liquidation   in order   to avoid   a corporate-level   tax. The  ignorant   did   what   came   naturally—and   often   was   a practical   necessity  for   large   corporations   with   many   assets   and   shareholders—by   selling assets   at the   corporate   level   prior   to the   liquidation.   With   such   high   tax  stakes,   the   courts   were   called   upon   to determine   who   in substance   made  the   sale—an   inquiry   that   engendered   some   anomalous   results,   as  evidenced   by the two   Supreme   Court   decisions   that   follow.  Commissioner   v.   Court   Holding   Co.  Supreme   Court   of the   United   States,   1945.  324.5.   331.   65.5:Ct-   707.  = MR.   JUSTICE   BLACK   delivered   the   opinion   of the   Court. An   apartment house, which was the sole asset of the respondent corporation, was   transferred in the form of a liquidating   dividend to the corporation’s   two   shareholders. They in turn formally conveyed it toa  purchaser who had originally negotiated for the purchase from the  corporation. The question is whether the   Circuit Court of Appeals properly   reversed the Tax Court’s conclusion that   the corporation   was taxable under § 22 of  the   Internal Revenue Code for the gain which accrued   from the sale. The   answer   depends   upon   whether the  findings of the Tax   Court that   the whole   transaction showed a sale by the corporation   rather   than   by the stockholders   were final and   binding   upon tthe Circuit Court of Appeals. It  is unnecessary to  set  out   in detail   the   evidence   introduced   before the Tax   Court or   its findings.   Despite   conflicting   evidence,   the   following  findings   of  the Tax   Court are supported   by the record:  tax   benefit   rule   and   assignment   of  income   doctrine.   See, e.g., Hillsboro   National   Bank v.  Commissioner,   460   U.S.   370,   103   S.Ct.   1134   (1983).  331

332   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  The   respondent   corporation   was   organized   in 1934   solely to buy   and hold   the   apartment   building   which   was   the   only property   ever   owned   by  it. All   of its   outstanding   stock   was   owned   by   Minnie   Miller   and   her  husband.   Between   October   1,   1939   and   February,   1940,   while   the  corporation   still had   legal   title   to the   property,   negotiations   for its   sale took   place.   These   negotiations   were   between   the   corporation   and   the lessees   of the property,   together   with   a sister   and   brother-in-law.   An   oral  agreement   was   reached   as   to   the   terms   and   conditions   of sale,   and on  February   22,   1940,   the   parties   met   to reduce   the   agreement   to writing. The   purchaser   was   then   advised   by the   corporation’s   attorney   that   the  sale could   not be consummated   because   it would   result   in the imposition  of a large   income   tax   on   the   corporation.   The   next   day,   the   corporation declared   a “liquidating   dividend,”   which   involved   complete   liquidation   of  its   assets,   and   surrender   of all outstanding   stock.   Mrs.   Miller   and   her husband   surrendered   their   stock,   and   the   building   was   deeded   to them. A   sale   contract   was   then   drawn,   naming   the   Millers   individually   as  vendors,   and   the   lessees’   sister   as   vendee,   which   embodied   substantially  the   same   terms   and   conditions   previously   agreed   upon.   One   thousand dollars,   which   a month   and a half earlier   had been   paid to the corporation  by the   lessees,   was   applied   in part   payment   of the   purchase   price.   Three days   later,   the   property   was   conveyed   to the   lessees’   sister.  The   Tax Court concluded   from these facts   that, despite the  declaration of a “liquidating dividend”   followed by the transfers of legal  title, the corporation had not abandoned the sales negotiations;   that these were mere formalities designed “to make the transaction appear to  be   other than what it was” in order to avoid tax   lability. The Circuit Court of Appeals   drawing different inferences from the   record, held   that  the corporation had “called off’ the sale, and treated   the stockholders’  sale as unrelated to the   prior negotiations. There   was   evidence to support the findings of the Tax Court, and its  findings must therefore   be accepted by the courts. Dobson v.  Commissioner, 320 U.S.   489; Commissioner v. Heininger,   320   U.S.   467;  Commissioner v. Scottish American   Investment Co., 323   U.S. 119. On the  basis of these   findings,   the Tax   Court   was justified   in attributing the gain  from the sale to respondent corporation. The incidence of taxation  depends   upon the substance of a transaction. The tax consequences which arise from   gains   from a sale   of property are   not   finally to be determined solely by the means   employed to transfer legal title. Rather,  the transaction must be viewed as   a whole,   and   each step, from the  commencement of negotiations to the consummation of   the sale,   is  relevant. A sale by one person   cannot   be transformed for tax purposes into a sale by  another   by  using   the   latter   as   a conduit   through   which to  pass title. To   permit the   true nature of a transaction to be   disguised   by  mere   formalisms,   which exist   solely   to   alter   tax liabilities, would seriously   impair   the   effective administration of   the   tax   policies   of Congress.

CHAPTER 7 COMPLETE LIQUIDATIONS   333  It   is urged   that   respondent   corporation   never   executed   a   written  agreement,   and   that   an   oral   agreement   to sell land   cannot   be enforced   in  Florida   because   of the   Statute   of Frauds,   Comp.Gen.Laws   of Florida,  1927,   vol.   3,   §   5779.   But   the fact that   respondent   corporation   itself never  executed   a   written   contract   is unimportant,   since   the   Tax   Court   found  from   the   facts   of the   entire   transaction   that   the   executed   sale   was   in substance   the sale of the corporation.   The   decision   of the   Circuit   Court   of Appeals   is reversed,   and   that   of the Tax   Court   affirmed.  It is so   ordered.  United   States   v.   Cumberland   Public   Service   Co.  Supreme   Court   of the   United   States,   1950.  338   U.S.   451,   70 S.Ct.   280.  ms MR.   JUSTICE   BLACK   delivered   the   opinion   of the   Court. A corporation   selling its physical   properties   is taxed   on   capital   gains resulting   from   the   sale.   There   is   no   corporate   tax,   however,   on  distribution   of   assets   in   kind   to   shareholders   as   part   of   a   genuine  liquidation.   The   respondent   corporation   transferred   property   to   its shareholders   as   a   liquidating   dividend   in   kind.   The   shareholders transferred   it to a purchaser.   The   question   is whether,   despite   contrary  findings   by the   Court   of Claims,   this   record   requires   a holding   that   the  transaction   was   in   fact   a   sale   by   the   corporation   subjecting   the corporation   to a capital   gains   tax.  Details   of the   transaction   are   as   follows.   The   respondent,   a closely held   corporation,   was   long   engaged   in   the   business   of generating   and  distributing   electric   power   in three   Kentucky   counties.   In   1936 a local  cooperative   began   to distribute   Tennessee   Valley Authority   power   in the  area   served   by   respondent.   It   soon   became   obvious   that   respondent’s  Diesel-generated   power   could   not   compete   with   TVA   power,   which  respondent   had   been   unable   to   obtain.   Respondent’s   shareholders,  realizing   that   the   corporation   must   get out   of the   power   business   unless  it obtained   TVA   power,   accordingly   offered   to sell all the   corporate   stock  to   the   cooperative,   which   was   receiving   such   power.   The   cooperative refused   to   buy   the   stock,   but   countered   with   an   offer   to   buy   from   the  corporation   its   transmission   and   distribution   equipment.   The  corporation   rejected   the   offer   because   it would   have   been   compelled   to pay   a   heavy   capital   gains   tax.   At   the   same   time   the   shareholders, desiring   to   save   payment   of the   corporate   capital   gains   tax,   offered   to “acquire   the transmission   and   distribution   equipment   and then   sell to the cooperative.   The   cooperative   accepted.   The   corporation   transferred   the transmission   and   distribution   systems   to   its   shareholders   in   partial liquidation.   The   remaining   assets   were   sold   and   the   corporation  dissolved.   The   shareholders   then   executed   the   previously   contemplated  sale to the cooperative.

334   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Upon   this   sale by the   shareholders,   the   Commissioner   assessed   and collected   a   $17,000   tax   from   the   corporation   on   the   theory   that   the  shareholders   had   been   used   as   a mere   conduit   for effectuating   what was  really   a   corporate   sale.   Respondent   corporation   brought   this   action   to  recover   the amount   of the tax. The   Court   of Claims   found   that the method  by   which   the   stockholders   disposed   of   the   properties   was   avowedly  chosen   in order   to reduce   taxes,   but   that   the   liquidation   and   dissolution genuinely   ended   the corporation’s   activities   and   existence.   The   court   also  found   that   at   no   time   did   the   corporation   plan   to   make   the   sale   itself. Accordingly   it found   as   a fact that the sale was   made   by the shareholders  rather   than   the   corporation,   and   entered   judgment   for respondent.   One judge   dissented,   believing   that   our   opinion   in   Commissioner   v.   Court Holding   Co., 324 U.S.   331, required   a finding that the sale had been   made  by   the   corporation.   Certiorari   was   granted,   338   U.S.   846,   to   clear   up  doubts   arising   out   of the   Court   Holding   Co.   case.  Our Court Holding Co. decision   rested on findings of fact by the Tax Court that a sale had been made and gains realized by the taxpayer corporation. There the corporation had negotiated for sale   of its assets and   had   reached an oral agreement of sale. When the   tax consequences of the corporate sale were   belatedly   recognized, the corporation  purported to   “call off’ the sale at the last minute and distributed the physical   properties in kind to the stockholders. They   promptly   conveyed these   properties to the same persons who had negotiated   with the  corporation. The terms of purchase were   substantially   those of the previous oral agreement. One   thousand dollars already   paid to the corporation   was   applied as part payment of the purchase price. The   Tax Court   found that   the corporation   never really abandoned its sales  negotiations, that it never did   dissolve, and that   the sole purpose of the so-called liquidation was to disguise a corporate sale through use   of mere formalisms in order to avoid tax   lability. The Circuit Court of Appeals took a different view of the evidence.   In this Court the Government  contended that whether a liquidation   distribution was   genuine or merely a sham was traditionally a question of fact. We agreed   with this  contention, and reinstated the Tax Court’s   findings and   judgment. Discussing the evidence which   supported the  findings of fact, we went on to say   that   “the incidence of taxation depends   upon the substance of a  transaction”   regardless of “mere   formalisms,”   and that   taxes on a corporate sale cannot be avoided   by  using the sharehelders as   a “conduit  through   which to pass title.”  This language does   not mean that a corporation   can   be   taxed   even when the   sale has   been made   by its stockholders   following a genuine liquidation   and dissolution.’ While the   distinction between sales by a  emphasizing the  established   principle   that  in  resolving   such   questions as who   made a  sale, fact-  finding   tribunals in tax   cases   can   consider   motives,   intent,   and   conduct   in   addition to what

--- Page 405 ---

CHAPTER 7 COMPLETE LIQUIDATIONS  corporation as compared with distribution in kind   followed by shareholder sales may be   particularly shadowy and artificial when the  corporation is closely   held, Congress has chosen to recognize   such a distinction for tax purposes. The corporate tax is thus aimed primarily at the profits   of a going concern.   This is true despite the fact that gains realized from corporate sales are taxed, perhaps to prevent tax evasions,  even where the cash proceeds are at once distributed in liquidation.4 But  Congress has imposed no   tax on liquidating distributions in kind or on dissolution, whatever may be the motive for such _ liquidation. Consequently, a corporation may liquidate or dissolve without subjecting itself to the corporate gains tax, even though a primary motive is to avoid the burden of corporate taxation. Here,   on   the   basis   of   adequate   subsidiary   findings,   the   Court   of Claims   has   found   that   the sale in question   was   made   by the stockholders  rather   than   the   corporation.   The   Government’s   argument   that   the  shareholders   acted   as   a   mere   “conduit”   for   a   sale   by   respondent  corporation   must   fall before   this   finding.   The   subsidiary   finding   that   a  major   motive   of the   shareholders   was   to reduce   taxes   does   not   bar   this conclusion.   Whatever   the   motive   and   however   relevant   it   may   be   in  determining   whether   the   transaction   was   real   or   a   sham,   sales   of physical   properties   by   shareholders   following   a   genuine   liquidation distribution   cannot   be attributed   to the   corporation   for tax   purposes.  The   oddities   in tax consequences   that   emerge   from   the tax provisions here   controlling   appear   to be   inherent   in the   present   tax   pattern.   For   a  corporation   is taxed   if it sells   all its physical   properties   and   distributes the   cash   proceeds   as   liquidating   dividends,   yet   is   not   taxed   if that property   is distributed   in kind   and   is then   sold   by the   shareholders.   In  both   instances   the   interest   of the   shareholders   in the business   has   been  transferred   to the   purchaser.   Again,   if these   stockholders   had   succeeded  in   their   original   effort   to   sell   all their   stock,   their   interest   would   have  been   transferred   to   the   purchasers   just   as   effectively.   Yet   on   such   a  transaction   the   corporation   would   have   realized   no   taxable   gain.  Congress   having   determined that   different   tax consequences shall flow from different methods   by which the shareholders of a closely held  corporation may dispose of corporate   property,   we   accept its mandate. It  is for the trial court, upon   consideration of   an   entire transaction, to  determine the  factual category in which a particular   transaction   belongs. Here as in  the Court Holding Co.   case we   accept   the ultimate   findings of fact of  the trial tribunal. Accordingly the judgment of  the Court of Claims  is  appears in written   instruments   used   by parties to control   rights as among themselves. See, e.g.,  Helvering v. Clifford, 309   U.S.   331, 335-337;   Commissioner of  Internal Revenue v. Tower,   327 U.S.   280.  4 Tt has   also been   held   that where   corporate   liquidations are   effected through   trustees or  agents,   gains   from   sales   are   taxable to the   corporation as though it were a going   concern.   See, e.g., First   National   Bank v. United   States,   10  Cir.,  86 F.2d   938,   941;  Treas.Reg.   103, §  19.22(a)— 21.  335

336   T2 TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PAR  Affirmed.  = Mr.   JUSTICE   DOUGLAS   took   no   part   in the   consideration   or   decision   of  this   case.  NOTE  The   difficulties   faced   by the   courts   in reconciling   the   results   in   Court Holding   and   Cumberland   influenced   Congress   to   extend   the   General Utilities   doctrine   to liquidating   sales.   Under   the   1954   Code   version   of Section  337,   a   corporation   generally   did   not   recognize   gain   or   loss   on   a   sale   of  property   pursuant   to a plan   of complete   liquidation   except   for recapture   of  depreciation   and   a few   other   items.22   Aptly   named   the   “anti-Court   Holding”  provision,   former   Section   337   usually   ensured   that   the   tax   consequences   of liquidating   sales   and   distributions   were   the   same   regardless   of the   form   of  the   transaction.   In   either   case,   the   corporation   generally   did   not   recognize  gain   or   loss, while   the   buyer   (or distributee   shareholder)   took   a fair   market value   basis   in the   acquired   or   distributed   assets.   As   a result,   the   principal  tax   cost   of   a   complete   liquidation   or   taxable   disposition   of   assets   by   a liquidating   corporation   was   the   capital   gain   recognized   at   the   shareholder  level. Shortly after this extension of the General Utilities doctrine, reformers began calling for its repeal.23 Imposing a tax at the shareholder level, they  argued, did not justify exempting a liquidating corporation from tax   on the disposition of its appreciated property.   Until the 1980's, however,   support for repeal was limited to the academic community and a handful of principled  practitioners. “The   General,” it was said, had the   loyal backing of the  troops—hattalions of legislators and their business   constituents who looked  askance at the double tax.24 One justification for retaining the General  Utilities doctrine was that it provided relief from the double   taxation of corporate earnings by partially integrating the corporate and individual  taxes.*> More specialized pleaders   focused on the adverse impact of the  double tax   on the   “largely inflationary   gains” on long-held assets of small “Mom and   Pop” businesses. 26 Despite these arguments, the movement for legislative reform   gained momentum in the   1980s.27 Eventually, the House of Representatives  2   LR.C.   § 337   (pre-1987).  8   See, e.g., Lewis,   “A Proposed New Treatment for Corporate Distributions   and Sales in Liquidations,”   86th   Cong., 1st Sess., House   Committee on Ways and   Means, 3 Tax Revision  Compendium 1643 (1959).  *4 We are indebted to the late Professor Walter Blum for the military   analogy.   See Blum,  “Behind the General Utilities Doctrine, or Why Does the General Have So Much Support   from the Troops,”   62 Taxes 292 (1984).  25 See,   e.g., Nolan,   “Taxing   Corporate   Distributions of Appreciated Property: Repeal of  the General Utilities Doctrine   and Relief Measures,” 22 San   Diego L. Rev.   97   (1985).  76 See, e.g., “Reform of Corporate   Taxation,” Hearing before   the Committee on Finance,  United   States   Senate,   98th   Cong., 1st Sess.   148,   151,   1538-157, 174-176, 185, 268-270 (Oct. 24  1983).  27 See   Staff  of  the   Senate   Finance   Committee,   The   Subchapter   C  Revision   Act   of  1985: A  Final   Report   Prepared   by the   Staff, 99th   Cong., 1st  Sess.   6-8,   42-44,   52-54,   59-68 (S.Prt. 99— 47,   1985), recommending repeal   of   the   General Utilities   doctrine   except   for   liquidating

CHAPTER 7 COMPLETE LIQUIDATIONS  included   General   Utilities   repeal,   along   with   a   permanent   exception   for certain   closely   held   corporations,   in   its   version   of   the   1986   tax   reform  legislation.?8   The   House   Ways   and   Means   Committee   report   summarized   the rationale   for repeal   in the liquidation   setting:29  The   committee   believes   that   the   General   Utilities   rule, even   in  the   more   limited   form   in   which   it exists   today,   produces   many  incongruities   and   inequities   in the   tax   system.   First,   the   rule   may  create   significant   distortions   in business   behavior.   Economically,   a liquidating   distribution   is indistinguishable   from   a nonliquidating  distribution;   yet the   Code   provides   a substantial   preference   for the former.   A   corporation   acquiring   the   assets   of   a   liquidating  corporation   is able   to   obtain   a   basis   in   assets   equal   to   their   fair  market   value,   although   the   transferor   recognizes   no   gain   (other than   possibly   recapture   amounts)   on   the sale. The   tax benefits   may  make   the   assets   more   valuable   in the hands   of the transferee   than  in   the   hands   of the   present   owner.   The   effect   may   be   to   induce  corporations   with   substantial   appreciated   assets   to liquidate   and  transfer   their   assets   to   other   corporations   for   tax   reasons,   when economic   considerations   might   indicate   a different   course   of action. Accordingly,   the   General   Utilities   rule   may   be responsible,   at least in   part,   for   the   dramatic   increase   in   corporate   mergers   and  acquisitions   in recent   years.   The   committee   believes   that   the   Code  should   not   artificially   encourage   corporate   liquidations   and acquisitions,   and   believes   that   repeal   of the   General   Utilities   rule  is   a major   step   towards   that   goal.  Second,   the   General   Utilities   rule   tends   to   undermine   the  corporate   income   tax.   Under   normally   applicable   tax   principles, nonrecognition   of gain   is available   only   if the   transferee   takes   a  carryover   basis   in the   transferred   property,   thus   assuring   that   a  tax   will   eventually   be   collected   on   the   appreciation.   Where   the General   Utilities   rule   applies,   assets   generally   are   permitted   to leave   corporate   solution   and to take   a stepped-up   basis in the hands of the   transferee   without   the   imposition   of a   corporate-level   tax.  Thus,   the effect of the rule is to grant   a permanent   exemption   from  the   corporate   income   tax. The   Senate   had originally included   General Utilities repeal in its version of  the 1986 bill, but that provision   was later dropped,   reportedly   because of concerns over its adverse   impact on corporate   entrepreneurs. In  reconciling the   two bills, the Conference Committee adopted the House’s   approach.   To the   surprise of even   the  tax reformers, the  conferees went   beyond the  earlier -proposals by   eliminating   any permanent exceptions for closely   held corporations   and   providing   only   limited   transitional relief. The   General, so  it seemed,   had been   deserted   by the  troops   once   the  battle went   behind closed  distributions or   sales   of  certain   long-held   (over five years)   assets by closely   held   corporations with   under   $2  million   in assets. 28 H.R.   3838,   99th   Cong.,   1st  Sess.

338   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  doors.   Against   that   background   we   turn   to   the   current   corporate-level   tax  treatment   of liquidating   distributions   and   sales.  b.   LIQUIDATING   DISTRIBUTIONS   AND   SALES  The   current   version   of Section   336(a)   is the   reverse   of its 1954 Code  predecessor.   The   general   rule   requires   a   liquidating   corporation   to  recognize   gain   or   loss   on   the   distribution   of   property   in   complete  liquidation   as   if the   property   were   sold   to   the   distributee   at   its   fair  market   value.   If the   distributed   property   is subject   to   a liability   or   the  distributee   shareholder   assumes   a   liability   in   connection   with   the distribution,   the fair market   value   of the property   is treated   as being   not less   than   the   amount   of the   liability.3°   In   strengthening   the   double   tax regime   of Subchapter   C,   Congress   greatly   increased   the   tax   cost   of a complete   liquidation.   Whenever   a   corporation   makes   a   liquidating distribution   of appreciated   property,   gain   generally   will be recognized   at  the corporate   level and   the distribution   also will be a taxable   event   to the shareholders.3!  Once   Congress required a liquidating corporation to recognize   gain  or loss on liquidating distributions, it took   the next logical step by conforming the   tax treatment of liquidating sales. A corporation generally must recognize   gain or loss on any sale   of its assets pursuant to a complete liquidation plan.32 As a backstop against creative taxpayer planning, the Treasury was given   authority in Section   337(d) to issue  regulations as necessary or appropriate to prevent circumvention of these  rules.  c. LIMITATIONS ON RECOGNITION OF LOSS  The general rule   in Section   336(a) differs   in one important respect  from the   rules   in Section   311 governing   nonliquidating distributions. It  allows   the distributing corporation to recognize loss as well as gain. Moreover,   although Section   267   disallows losses   on   sales   of property by  a corporation to  a “related” party (e.g., a controlling shareholder), it does not disallow them on liquidating   distributions to related parties.33 This license to recognize   corporate-level losses quickly rattled   the Congressional   nervous   system.

Section   336(d)(1)   partially  reinstates   the   policy   of Section   267   by   providing   that   no   loss   shall   be  recognized   by a liquidating   corporation   on   the   distribution   of property   to a Section   267   related   person   if either:   (1) the   distribution   is not   pro   rata  among   the   shareholders,   or   (2) the   distributed   property   was   acquired   by the   lquidating   corporation   in   a   Section   351   transaction   or   as   a contribution   to capital   within   the   five-year   period   ending   on   the   date   of the distribution.   These   restrictions   thus   initially focus   on   the recipient   of  the   loss   property.   For   this   purpose,   related   persons   usually   will   be  shareholders   who   own   directly,   or   through   the   Section   267   attribution rules,   more   than   50   percent   in   value   of the   stock   of the   distributing  corporation. Neither   the   statute   nor   the   legislative   history   explains   when   a distribution   is   “not   pro   rata”   among   the   shareholders.   Congress presumably   intended   to   single   out   situations   where   a   majority shareholder   receives   an   interest   in loss property   that   is disproportionate to his stock   interest   in the   corporation.36   The   legislative   history   provides scant   illumination   of the   rationale   for   this   rule.   The   conferees   merely  expressed   an   intent   to restrict   the ability of taxpayers   to recognize   losses in   “inappropriate   situations.”37   Perhaps   Congress   believed   that   it was necessary   to   apply   the   loss   disallowance   policy   of   Section   267   to  liquidating   distributions   where   the parties   exercised   a measure   of control  by targeting   distributions   of loss property   to majority   shareholders—but at the   same   time   concluded   that   pro   rata   liquidating   distributions   were  less likely to be motivated   by tax   avoidance.*8  The rationale for limiting losses   on distributions of recently  contributed   property to  a related party is easier to discern—r at least it  was before Congress   imposed limitations on the  transfer of built-in   losses in Section   351   transactions.29   Before the enactment of Section 362(e)(2), taxpayers could   duplicate a single economic loss   for tax purposes   by transferring   property   with a built-in loss  to  a corporation in a Section   351  transaction or   as   a contribution to capital. For example, assume Sole  Shareholder (“Sole”) transferred   Lossacre   (adjusted basis—$1,000; fair market   value—$500) to her wholly owned   X Corporation (“X”)   in  34 See H.R.Rep. No. 99-841,   99th   Cong., 2d Sess. II-200 (1986).  35   T.R.C.   § 267(b)(2),   (c).  ‘e 36 For   example,   assume   X Corporation   has a net worth of $1,000   and is owned   75%   by A and   25%   by five unrelated   shareholders. X distributes Lossacre   (value—$750; basis   $1,000) to A and   $250   cash to the   other   shareholders.   Since   Lossacre   was not   distributed to the  shareholders in proportion to their   respective   stock   interests,   the   distribution ys not   pro   rata  and   X may not   recognize its $250 loss. 37 H_R.Rep.   No.   99-841,   supra   note   34, at  II-200.  38 Even if the   distribution is pro   rata, however, losses may be   disallowed if the   asset  distributed to   a related   person is “disqualified   property”   within   the meaning of   Section  336(d)(1)(B).

340   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  exchange   for $500   of X stock   in a Section   351   nonrecognition   transaction.  Under   prior law,   Sole   took   a $1,000   exchanged   basis   in her   new   X stock,*#9 and   X   took   Lossacre   with   a   $1,000   transferred   basis.41   Assume   further that,   three   years   later,   when   Lossacre   had   the   same   basis   and   value,   X  liquidated,   distributing   Lossacre   and   its other   assets   to Sole.   Without   an “outbound”   limitation,   both   Sole   Shareholder   and   the   corporation   would  recognize   a $500   loss   on   the   liquidation—two   losses   for the   price   of none  considering   that,   when   the   smoke   cleared,   Sole   still   owned   Lossacre.#2  The   same   technique   was   effective for controlling   shareholders   who   owned  less   than   100   percent   of the   corporation   if on   liquidation   they   received their   pro   rata   share   of each   corporate   asset.43 Section   336(d)(1)(A)(ii)   attacks   this form   of “stuffing”   with   a rule that extends   Section   267   principles   to   pro   rata   liquidating   distributions   of  “disqualified   property”   to   a   related   person.   “Disqualified   property”   is  defined   as   any   property   acquired   by the   liquidating   corporation   during the   five-year   period   preceding   the   distribution   in   a   Section   351  transaction   or   as   a contribution   to capital.44   Section   362(e)(2),   however,  now   imposes a   similar   limitation   on   duplication   of losses   in   “inbound”  transfers   of built-in   losses   in   Section   351   transactions.   Applying   that limitation   to the above   example,   Sole would   still take   a $1,000   exchanged  basis   in her X stock,   but   X’s basis   in Lossacre   would   be limited   to its $500  fair   market   value   at the   time   it was   transferred   to X. Asa   result,   on   its  liquidation   three   years   later,   X would   have   no recognized   loss and   Section  336(d)   would   not   apply. In its haste to adopt an inbound loss limitation rule, Congress may not have paused to ask whether the outbound limitations in Section  336(d)(1) should be   modified. One   answer that may explain the  continuing existence of Section   336(d)(1) is that it does not exclusively target duplication of  losses. It also applies to liquidating   distributions of  loss property to related persons that are not   pro   rata or are   of  “disqualified   property,”   even if the loss was realized while the property was held by the corporation. Although the   policy for such a limitation is  difficult   to defend in the context of a complete liquidation,   the Code often  40   I.R.C.   § 358(a).  41   T.R.C.   § 362(a).  42 Of course,   Sole will now hold Lossacre   with a stepped-down fair market value   basis   of  $500,   but  she will have   benefitted   from   two losses without ever having   disposed of  the  property.  43 As noted   previously,   corporate-level losses   on non pro   rata   (“bullet”) distributions to controlling shareholders are disallowed   under Section   336(d)(1)(A)Q).  ene LR.C,  § 336(d)(1)(B).

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  limits   losses   when   property   is   transferred   between   corporations   and  shareholders   as well   as   in other   related   party   transactions.45  Losses   with   Tax   Avoidance   Purpose.   Section   336(d)(2)   prevents   the  duplication   of   precontribution   built-in   losses   even   on   certain distributions   to minority   shareholders.   This   limitation   applies   only if the  distributing   corporation   acquired   property   in a   Section   351   transaction  or   as   a contribution   to capital   as   part   of a plan   the   principal   purpose   of  which   was   to   recognize   loss   by   the   corporation   on   a   liquidating   sale,  exchange   or   distribution   of the   property.   In that   event,   Section   336(d)(2) limits   the   corporation’s   deductible   loss   to the   amount   that   accrued   after the   corporation   acquired   the   property.   Precontribution   losses   are  disallowed   by a basis   step-down   rule   which   requires   the   corporation   to  reduce   its   basis   (but   not   below   zero)   in   the   affected   property   by   the amount   of built-in   loss   in the property   at the time   it was   acquired   by the corporation.*é  Section   336(d)(2)   is   reinforced   by   a   provision   that   treats   any  contribution   of   property   after   the   date   that   is   two   years   before   the adoption   of the plan of liquidation   as part of a forbidden   plan to recognize  loss,   except   as   the   Treasury   may   provide   in   regulations.47   Congress  provided   extensive   guidance   on   the   operation   of   this   two-year  presumption   and   the   escape   hatches   that   it expects   to   be   included   in future   regulations.   For   example,   although   a   contribution   made   more than   two   years   prior to the   adoption   of a liquidation   plan   might   be made with   a   prohibited   purpose,   the   Conference   Report   states   that   in   those circumstances   the basis   step-down   rule   in Section   336(d)(2)   would   apply  only   “in the   most   rare   and   unusual   cases.”48   The   legislative   history   also  directed   the   Treasury   to issue   regulations   generally   providing   that   even  contributions   of property   within   the   period   covered   by the   presumption should   be   disregarded   “unless   there   is   no   clear   and   substantial relationship   between   the   contributed   property   and   the   conduct   of the corporation’s   current   or   future   business   enterprises.”49   A   “clear   and  substantial   relationship”   generally   would   include   a   requirement   of a  corporate   business   purpose   for   placing   the   property   in   the   particular corporation   to   which   it was   contributed   as   compared   to   retaining   the property   outside   that   corporation.®®   If the   contributed   property   has   a  built-in   loss at the time   of contribution   that is “significant”   relative   to the  45 See, e.g., LR.C. § 351(b)(2)   (mo loss   on transfers to controlled corporations   even if  transferor receives boot); § 267(a)(1) (disallowance of   losses   in related   party   transactions);  § 1015(a)   (donee’s   basis for loss reduced for gifts  of  built-in loss property). 46 The built-in   loss   is the   excess of the adjusted basis   of  the property immediately after its acquisition   over its fair market value at that   time.

Section   362(e)(2),   which   was   studied   in Chapter   2 in connection   with corporate   formations,   effectively   disallows   most   precontribution   losses   by  stepping   down   the basis   of built-in   loss property   when   it is transferred   to  a   corporation   in   a   Section   351   transaction.   This   anti-avoidance   rule  greatly reduces   the role of Section   336(d)(2).   But   there   still are   situations where   the   Section   362(e)(2)   “inbound”   rule   does   not   step   down   the   basis of built-in   loss property   and   Section   336(d)(2)   will   apply—e.g.,   where   the  corporation   holds   some   properties   with   built-in   losses   that   are   subject   to  Section   336(d)(2)   but   the   inbound   stepdown   rule   does   not   apply   because  the   aggregate   basis   of all   properties   transferred   by   a   transferor   in   a Section   351   transaction   does   not   exceed   their   aggregate   fair   market  value.   Query,   however,   whether   the   section   336(d)(2)   loss   limitation   rule  is   still   necessary   in   this   situation?   Perhaps   the   best   explanation   is traditional   Congressional   paranoia   regarding   abuse   of tax   losses.  Overlap Situations. If both   Section 336(d)(1) and Section 336(d)(2)  apply to the same transaction, the harsher rule in Section 336(d)(1)  (which disallows the   entire loss rather than just the precontribution  built-in loss) takes precedence.52  PROBLEMS  1.

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  (c)   Same   as   (b), above,   except   X distributes   Gainacre   and   the cash to Ivan   and   Lossacre   to Flo. (d)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   X   acquired   Lossacre   as   a  contribution   to capital   four   years   ago,   and   X was   not   required  to   reduce   its   basis   under   § 362(e).   Is   the   result   different   if  Lossacre   had   a value   of $1,000,000   and a basis   of $800,000   at  the   time   it was   contributed   to the   corporation?  (e)   What   result   on   the   distributions   in   (c), above   (i.e.,   Gainacre and   cash   to   Ivan,   Lossacre   to   Flo)   if Lossacre,   which   had   no  relationship   to X’s   business   operations,   was   transferred   to X by Ivan   and   Flo   in a § 351   transaction   18   months   prior to the adoption   of the   liquidation   plan,   when   Lossacre   had   a   fair  market   value   of $700,000   and   an   adjusted   basis   of $800,000?  Assume,   alternatively,   that   § 362(e)(2)   did   and   did   not   apply to the contribution   of Lossacre   to X. 2.   All   of the   outstanding   stock   of X   Corporation   is   owned   by   Ivan   (80  shares)   and   Flo   (20   shares).   X   has   no   liabilities.   Ivan   contributed   Gainacre  ($100,000   adjusted   basis,   $400,000   fair   market   value)   and   Lossacre  ($800,000   adjusted   basis,   $400,000   fair   market   value)   to X.   Flo   contributed  $200,000   cash.   Assume   Lossacre   is § 336(d)(1)   “disqualified   property”   and § 362(e)(2)   applied   to   Ivan’s   contribution,   but   § 336(d)(2)   does   not   apply because   there   was   no   “plan”   for X to recognize   loss on   that   property. (a)   What   result   if pursuant   to a plan   of liquidation   X distributes each   of   its   assets   to   Ivan   and   Flo   in   proportion   to   their  respective   stock   interests?  (b) Same as (a), above,   except assume that § 362(e)(2) applies to Ivan’s contributions to X and § 336(d)(2)   applies to Lossacre because there was a “plan” by X to recognize loss in that  property.  C. LIQUIDATION OF   A SUBSIDIARY 1. CONSEQUENCES TO THE SHAREHOLDERS  Code:   §§ 332;   334(b)(1);   1223(2). Regulations:   §§ 1.332-1,   —2, —5.  Nonrecognition   treatment is inappropriate on   an ordinary   complete liquidation   because it would   permit   individual   shareholders to achieve a  tax-free   bailout as they   watch the   corporation’s   earnings   and profits “account   disappear   from the   scene. Different   policy considerations   come into play when a parent   corporation   liquidates a controlled   subsidiary. Since   the   assets   of   the   subsidiary   remain in corporate   solution,   the liquidation is a mere   change in form   that   should   not   be impeded   by the  imposition   of  a tax. The   subsidiary’s   tax attributes,   including its earnings  and profits,   can   be   inherited   by   the   parent   without   administrative burdens.   Moreover,   the   subsidiary   could   have   paid   tax-free   dividends   to  343

344   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  the   parent   under   Section   243   or   the   consolidated   return rules. All these factors,   together   with   a   desire   to   encourage   the   simplification   of corporate   structures,   influenced   Congress   to   adopt   a   nonrecognition scheme   by enacting   the   statutory   predecessor   of Section   332. Section   332   provides   that   a parent   corporation   recognizes   no   gain   or loss   on   the receipt   of property   in complete   liquidation   of an   80 percent   or more   subsidiary   if certain   conditions   are   met.   In that   event,   the   parent generally   takes   the   distributed   assets   with   a   transferred   basis   under  Section   334(b)(1)53   and   inherits   the subsidiary’s   earnings   and   profits   and other   tax   attributes   under   Section   381(a)(1).54 To   qualify   under   Section   332,   the   subsidiary   must   distribute  property   to its parent   in complete   cancellation   or redemption   of its stock  pursuant   to   a   plan   of liquidation,   and   the   liquidation   must   meet   two  formal   requirements,   one   relating   to control   and   the   other   to timing.  Control. Under Section 332(b)(1), the parent must   own at least 80  percent of the total voting power of the   stock of the subsidiary and 80 percent of the total value of all outstanding stock of the subsidiary from the   date of adoption of the plan of complete liquidation and at all times thereafter until the parent receives   the final distribution.55 This condition normally is not a problem if the subsidiary is wholly   owned, but any significant minority ownership creates a risk that   the transaction will run afoul of the   control requirement. Indeed, a parent   corporation  sometimes is motivated to intentionally violate the   80 percent tests in  order to avoid   Section   332 and recognize a loss on its stock in the  subsidiary.56 Conversely, an aspiring parent that does not meet the control test may seek to qualify a liquidation under Section   332 by  acquiring more stock of the subsidiary or causing the subsidiary to redeem stock held by minority   shareholders shortly   before   the  liquidation. As illustrated by the Riggs case, below, this strategy may  trigger a controversy   with the  Service over when the liquidation plan  was adopted.  58 If the liquidating   subsidiary is not subject to U.S.   tax with   respect to the distributed  property (e.g., because it is  a foreign corporation) and the distributee parent is subject to U.S. tax (e.g.,   it is a domestic corporation),   the   distributee’s aggregate   adjusted basis of the distributed   property, if it otherwise would exceed its fair market value, must be limited to the  lesser fair market value. LR.C. § 334(b)(1)(B); Reg. § 1.334—1(b)(3). The   purpose of   this  limitation is  to prevent   importation of tax  losses   into the U.S.   tax system   through the  liquidation  of a foreign   subsidiary.   See Chapter 2A,  supra, for  a similar rule   for ingorporation   transactions.  54 The parent’s   basis in the stock of a subsidiary is not taken into account in determining  the   tax consequences of a Section   332   liquidation and   disappears   from the   scene. This   creates the  possibility that the parent may be deprived of a loss on its investment in  the subsidiary   even  though it must inherit a low   carryover basis   in its assets. 55 6 The stock ownership requirements are derived   from   Section   1504(a)(2), which sets forth rules for determining   whether a corporation is a member of  an   “affiliated group.”   For   purposes of  the   stock ownership   requirement,   most   nonconvertible   preferred   stock is disregarded.   LR.C. stock   (except   nonvoting stock   limited   and   preferred as to dividends),   does   not refle 1 i  ) ct legislat  changes to Section   332(b)(1).   aber oale  56 See   Commissioner v.

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  Timing.   Section   332   includes   two   timing   alternatives.   “One-shot” liquidations   qualify   if the   subsidiary   distributes   all of its assets   within  one   taxable   year®’   even   if it is not   the   same   year   in which   the liquidation  plan   is adopted.58   Where   the   distributions   span   more   than   one   taxable year,   the   plan   must   provide   that   the   subsidiary   will   transfer   all of its property   within   three   years   after   the   close   of the   taxable   year   in which the   first   distribution   is made.59   Failure   to meet   the   deadline   will   cause  the   liquidation   to be retroactively   disqualified. Minority   Shareholders.   Nonrecognition   under   Section   332   is only granted   to   the   controlling   parent   corporation.   It   is   not   available   to  minority   shareholders,   who   must   determine   their   gain   or   loss   in   the normal   manner   under   Section   331(a)   unless   the liquidation   also qualifies  as   a tax-free   reorganization—a   rare   situation   that   will   be   explored   in a later   chapter.®1  George   L.

Commissioner  United   States   Tax   Court,   1975.  64 T.C.   474.  mg DRENNEN,   JUDGE:  Respondent   determined   a   deficiency   in   petitioner’s   income   tax   for  the   taxable   year   ended   March   31,   1969,   in the   amount   of $589,882.28.  The   sole issue   for determination   is whether   the plan of liquidation   of Riggs-Young   Corp.,   a   subsidiary   of   the   petitioner,   was   adopted  subsequent   to the   time   when   petitioner   owned   at least   80 percent   of the outstanding   stock   of Riggs-Young,   thereby   rendering   section   332,   I.R.C. 1954,   applicable   to the   liquidation   so   that   the   gain to petitioner   thereon  is not   to be recognized.  FINDINGS   OF   FACT  [George L. Riggs, Inc., referred to throughout the opinion as “petitioner,” was a holding company which as of December, 1967, owned  approximately 35.6 percent (2,432   out   of 6,840   shares) of the nonvoting preferred stock and 72.13 percent (8,047   out   of 11,156   shares) of the  common stock   of The   Standard Electric Time Co. (“Standard”). Standard owned 90 percent of  the outstanding stock   of a Delaware subsidiary   and 99.5 percent of a California   subsidiary. The   corporations   were in the business of manufacturing   and   marketing electric clocks and signal  = 57 LR.C. § 332(b)(2); Reg. § 1.332-3.   In this situation,   the adoption   by the shareholders of the   resolution   authorizing the   distributions in liquidation is considered an adoption of a “plan” of liquidation   even though it may not   specify   the time for completing the transfers.  58 Rey.

To  allow   the Service to assert   deficiencies for the early   distributions   in  the  event of a retroactive   disqualification,   the   parent is required to  file  a waiver of  the normal three   year  statute   of  limitations   and   may be   asked to post a bond in  order to protect   the Commissioner’s ability  to collect   past   due   taxes. 61 Reg.   §  1.332-5.

346   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  devices.   Standard   was   the   manufacturing   arm   of the   business,   and   the  two   subsidiaries   handled   marketing.  On   December   13,   1967,   Frances   Riggs-Young,   the   president   of  Standard   and   controlling   shareholder   of   petitioner,   notified   all   of Standard’s   shareholders   that   the   company   and   its subsidiaries   would   be  seeking   approval   for a sale   of substantially   all of the   operating   assets   of the   companies.   In connection   with   the   sale,   Standard   changed   its name  to Riggs-Young   Corporation.   The   sales   were   consummated   on   December  29,   1967.   In February,   1968,   Riggs-   Young   (formerly   Standard)   redeemed  all of its preferred   stock.   On   April   17,   1968,   the   directors   of Riggs-Young approved   the   liquidation   of the   Delaware   and   California   subsidiaries, and   authorized   Riggs-Young   to offer to redeem   common   stock   from   all of its   shareholders   with   the   exception   of   petitioner   and   Frances   Riggs- Young.   The   stated   purpose   of this   tender   offer   was   to   eliminate   the minority   shareholders   and   provide   them   with   the   opportunity   to receive  cash   for their   stock.   The   Tax   Court   also   found   that   counsel   to petitioner  and   the   related   subsidiaries   “recognized   the   desirability   of petitioner’s owning   80 percent   of the   common   stock   of Riggs-Young   (1) to permit   the filing   of   consolidated   returns,   and   (2)   to   permit   the   possible   further  liquidation   of Riggs-Young   under   section   332   of the   Code   to simplify   the corporate   structure.”   64 T.C.   at 480.   The   letter informing   shareholders   of the redemption   offer stated   that   “If this offer is accepted   by substantially  all of the   stockholders   to whom   it is directed,   the   Directors   will   consider  liquidation   and   final   dissolution   of the   Corporation.”   64 T.C.   at 479.  At the time of its redemption offer, petitioner owned 72.13 percent of Riggs-Young’s common stock. The remaining shares   were owned by members of the Riggs family,   related trusts and a small group of unrelated   minority   shareholders.  The tender offer was made on April 26, 1968 and   expired on May 28,  1968. During this period, owners of 2,738   shares of common stock  tendered their shares for redemption.   As a result of these redemptions,  petitioner owned at least 80 percent of Riggs-Young’s common stock on May 9, 1968, and its ownership increased to 95.6 percent by May 28. On  June 20, 1968,   the   directors and   shareholders of Riggs-Young   approved a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution of the corporation. Between  June   and December, 1968, when the liquidation was   completed,   Riggs-  Young   made distributions to petitioner in excess of  $2.2   million.  Petitioner   realized a gain of $2, 168,975   from the liquidation of Riggs- Young,   representing the  difference between the  liquidating   distributions and petitioner’s $42,465 basis   in its Riggs-Young stock. The gain   was  reported on   petitioner’s   tax return   but  not recognized   under the authority  of Section 332.   Ed.]  OPINION The   only   question for  decision is whether   petitioner owned at  least 80 percent   of the  outstanding   stock   of  its subsidiary,   Riggs-Young   Corp.,

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  at the   time   Riggs-Young   Corp.   adopted   a plan   of liquidation   within   the  meaning   of   section   332,   I.R.C.   1954,   so   that   the   gain   realized   by petitioner   on   the   liquidation   of Riggs-Young   is not   to be   recognized   by virtue   of that   section.   The   vital   question   is when   did   Riggs-   Young   adopt  a plan   of liquidation   within   the   meaning   of section   332.  Respondent   argues   that   the   plan   of   liquidation   was   adopted   on  December   27,   1967,   when   about   90   percent   of the   stock   of Riggs-Young  (then   Standard)   was   voted   in   favor   of   selling   substantially   all   of the assets   of Riggs-Young   and   its two   subsidiaries,   Delaware   and   California,  to SET;   or not later than   about   April   17, 1968,   when   the board   of directors  of Riggs-Young   voted   to liquidate   Delaware   and   California   and   to make  an   offer   to   purchase   all   of   the   common   stock   of   Riggs-Young   then  outstanding   with   the   exception   of the   stock   owned   by   petitioner   and  Frances   Riggs-Young.4  On   the other   hand   petitioner   contends   that   the plan of liquidation   of Riggs-Young   was   first   adopted   when   it was   formally   adopted   by vote   of  the   stockholders   on   June   20,   1968,   or   at   the   earliest   when   counsel   for  petitioner   recommended   to petitioner   in the early days   of June   1968   that it liquidate   Riggs-Young.   Petitioner   also   contends   that   section   332   is an elective   section   and   a taxpayer,   by taking   appropriate   steps,   can   render that   section   applicable   or inapplicable. The   parties   are   in agreement   that by May   9, 1968,   petitioner   was   the  owner   of at least   80 percent   of the outstanding   stock   of Riggs-Young. Section   332(a)   of the Code   provides   as a general   rule: “No   gain or loss shall be recognized   on the receipt by a corporation   of property   distributed in complete   liquidation   of another   corporation.”   Subsection   (b) of section  332   establishes   certain   requirements   which   must   be   satisfied   before  subsection   (a) becomes   applicable.   The   only requirement   of subsection   (b)  which   is   in   issue   in   this   case   is   whether   petitioner,   which   received  property   from   Riggs-Young   in   liquidation,   was,   on   the   date   of   the adoption   of the plan of liquidation,   the owner   of at least   80 percent   of the stock   of Riggs-Young,   the   liquidating   corporation. Nowhere in the pertinent statute is the phrase “the date of the adoption of  the plan of liquidation”   defined. However, in attempting to define this phrase for purposes of  the provision of [1954   Code] section 337,   the regulations of  the Commissioner provide:  Ordinarily the   date of  the adoption of a plan of complete liquidation by a corporation is the   date   of adoption   by the  shareholders of  the  resolution   authorizing the  distribution of all  the   assets   of  the   corporation   (other than   those   retained to meet claims)   in redemption of all of its stock. *  *  * [Sec.   1.3837—2(b), Income   Tax Regs.;   accord,   Virginia Ice &  Freezing Corp.,   30  T.C.  1251 (1958).|}  4 Respondent specifically   does   not   rely on   the   “end-result” or “step-transaction”   theory inspnisicases 5 9  347

348  tT)   Uew   >   Qe  TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  The   date   of   this   shareholder   resolution   should   ordinarily   be considered   the   date   of the   adoption   of the plan of liquidation   for purposes  of section   332.   See   sec.   332(b)(2).  This   Court   has   noted,   in interpreting   section   112(b)(6),   I.R.C.   1939  (the predecessor   of section   332,   I.R.C.   1954),   that   although   the   adoption  of the   plan   of liquidation   “need   not   be   evidenced   by formal   action   of the corporation   or   the   stockholders.   * * *   even   an   informal   adoption   of the  plan   to   liquidate   presupposes   some   kind   of definitive   determination   to achieve   dissolution.”   Distributors   Finance   Corp.,   20 T.C.   768,   784   (19538).  The   mere   general   intention   to liquidate   is not   the   adoption   of a plan   of  liquidation.   City Bank   of Washington,   38 T.C.   713   (1962).  Based   on   the   evidence   introduced   in   the   case   at   bar,   we   must  conclude   that   a   plan   for   the   liquidation   of Riggs-Young   had   not   been adopted   prior to the critical   date   of May   9, 1968. Respondent, in an effort to show that  the plan of liquidation of Riggs- Young was   informally adopted on December 27, 1967, or no   later than April 1968,   alludes to actions and   statements made in connection therewith   taken between December 1967 and June 1968. Petitioner offered   the testimony of persons   involved in those   actions to explain what the   parties had in mind in taking those   actions and making the statements   which cast a quite  different light on the reasons therefor. This  testimony was creditable and not shaken   by  cross-examination. In light of such evidence, we cannot agree   with respondent’s inference that these actions constituted an informal   adoption of a plan of liquidation of Riggs- Young prior to May 9, 1968.  Respondent argues that   the letter dated December 13, 1967,   sent to  the common shareholders of Standard   (Riggs-Young) notifying them of  the proposed sale   of its assets and that   the corporation   was  contemplating an offer   to purchase the common shares   held by all  shareholders other than petitioner if the sale was   approved, clearly  indicates   that   the shareholders at the meeting on December 27, 1967, intended to approve not only the sale   of the   assets, but also the liquidation of Standard (Riggs- Young).  We believe this   infers too much.   As petitioner   points out, the   use   of  the word   “contemplated”   shows the acquisition of the common stock of the minority   shareholders   was   merely a possibility about which a final decision had not been   made. In any event, from the possibility   of a tender  offer   to the minority   shareholders,   we   cannot   conclude,   ipso facto, that a  plan for the  liquidation had   been   adopted.   Petitioner   explained that   the possibility   of  this tender offer was made   known to the shareholders in order to avoid   any   possible   disclosure problem   with   the   securities law  and to apprise   the   shareholders,   from a fairness   standpoint, of eventual  possibilities   resulting   from   the sale. This   explanation is reasonable.  Respondent next   points to  the   fact  that   on February 28,   1968, all of  the   6,840   shares   of   preferred   stock   of Riggs-Young   were   called   for

--- Page 419 ---

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  redemption   as   additional   evidence   that   a   definite   decision   to   liquidate  the   corporation   had   been   made.   We   believe   petitioner   adequately explained   that   this   redemption   was   based   on   sound   business   reasons. The   preferred   stock   had   a par   value   of $25   per   share   and   a cumulative dividend   of 8 percent.   This   stock   was   subject   to redemption   at the option of Riggs-Young   upon   payment   of the   par   value   and   any   accumulated  dividend.   The   testimony   of Norman   Vester,   a director   of Riggs-Young   and  president   of Security   National   Bank   which   was   cotrustee   of Riggs   Trust, and   Roger   Stokey,   the   attorney   for petitioner,   Riggs-Young,   and   Frances Riggs-Young,   reveal   that   the   redemption   of   the   preferred   stock   was  motivated   by the desire   to eliminate   the excessive   burden   of a cumulative dividend   of 8 percent   and   to   reduce   the   number   of shareholders   with  whom   Riggs-Young   and   National   Security   Bank,   as   cotrustee   of   the  majority   shareholder,   would   have   to   deal.   Both   Vester   and   Stokey  testified   that   as   of January   19,   1968,   the   date   the   board   of directors   of  Riggs-Young   voted   to redeem   the   preferred   stock,   no   decision   had   been  made   to   liquidate   the   corporation,   and,   therefore,   no   plan   had   been  adopted.  Respondent   next   claims   that   a   letter   dated   April   23,   1968,   from  Stokey   to   Scott   C.   Jordan   categorically   shows   that   a   plan   to   liquidate Riggs-Young   had   been   adopted   prior   to   the   date   of the   letter.   Stokey’s  letter was   in response   to a letter   from   Jordan   on behalf   of Frances   Riggs-  Young   inquiring   whether   she   could   participate   in the   tender   offer   that  was   about   to be made   to the minority   shareholders   of Riggs- Young.   In his  letter,   Stokey   said that   Frances   Riggs-Young   might   run   some   tax risks   if she   accepted   a   tender   offer   by   Riggs-Young,   apparently   basing   this  statement   on   his belief that   the   amount   she received   from   a tender   offer  might   be   taxed   to   her   at   ordinary   income   rates.   As   a   result   of   this potential   risk, Stokey   stated   in the letter:   “Accordingly,   we   are   arranging for her   to receive   her   money   in a liquidation.” Respondent perceives this statement   by  Stokey as a clear indication that a plan of liquidation of   Riggs- Young had   been   adopted   by a definite decision by April 23, 1963. We cannot so conclude. Stokey testified that “we,”  referred to as arranging the liquidation, meant Stokey   and   another  member of  his law firm, William Gorham. This letter merely   shows that the attorneys   involved in these   transactions   were   contemplating the  possibility   of a liquidation of Riggs-Young. It in no way proves   that   the directors or shareholders of  the corporation   had made a definite   decision or informally   adopted a plan of  liquidation. Finally, respondent   views   the letter dated   April 26,   1968,   drafted by Frances   Riggs-Young as president of Riggs-Young,   which   contained the  tender offer   to the common shareholders,   other   than   petitioner   and  Frances   Riggs-Young, as an   additional   indication   of  a prior  adoption of a plan to   liquidate.   In   this   letter, Frances   Riggs-Young did   state   that if  substantially all  of the   shareholders   accepted   the   offer,   the   directors   of  349

--- Page 420 ---

350  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  the corporation   would   consider   liquidation   and   final   dissolution   of Riggs-  Young. Stokey   testified   that   Gorham   and   he inserted,   in this April   26 letter,  the   reference   to   the   possible   consideration   of liquidating   Riggs-Young. He   also   candidly   admitted   that   he   had   undoubtedly   discussed   the possibility   of liquidation   of   Riggs-   Young   at some   prior point with   Frances Riggs-Young,   but   hastened   to   add   that   he   neither   recommended liquidation   at   this   time   nor   did   she   direct   steps   be   taken   to   liquidate.  Further,   Stokey   testified   that   he   would   never   have   recommended  liquidation   of Riggs-Young   if petitioner   had   failed   to   achieve   the   80-  percent   ownership. Petitioner   contends   that   the   tender   offer   to   the   minority shareholders   was   made   solely   for business   considerations   and   not   with  an   eye   toward   the   eventual   liquidation   of   Riggs-Young.   Vester   and Stokey   both   testified   that   since   the   assets   of   Riggs-Young   had   been  exchanged   for   cash,   the   primary   purpose   of   the   tender   offer   was   to  eliminate   minority   shareholders   who   might   have   different   investment objectives   for   this   cash   than   the   majority   shareholder.   The   bank,   as trustee   of Riggs,   did   not   want   to   have   to   deal   with   a   large   group   of  minority   shareholders.   Furthermore,   Stokey   testified   that   Frances  Riggs-Young   desired   to have   the   minority   shareholders,   many   of whom were   former   employees   of Standard,   receive   cash   for their   stock   rather than   have   them   remain   locked   in as   minority   shareholders   of a personal  holding   company.  Stokey testified that another objective of the tender offer was to  increase petitioner’s ownership of Riggs-Young to 80 percent thereby  enabling them to file a consolidated return. According to petitioner, the ultimate   liquidation of Riggs-Young was not motivated   by tax considerations   and the sole advantage to be achieved   from the liquidation  was the simplification of petitioner’s corporate structure.   Petitioner  alleges   that Riggs-Young could have   been   kept in existence without   any tax disadvantage. In fact the liquidation of Riggs-Young actually  resulted in a tax disadvantage to Frances Riggs-Young personally since she had  to pay capital gains tax  on her   share of the liquidation   proceeds. She   was  a wealthy woman in her   seventies and not   in need of these funds   and could have left this money in corporate   solution until her   death to enable  it to receive a stepped-up basis for the  beneficiaries of her estate.  We believe   petitioner’s explanations of why the   actions were   taken and the statements   were made are   true and that   the considerations  mentioned were   taken into account in making the  decisions   that followed.  While the motives enumerated   by petitioner   do   not   directly negate the  notion   that.a   liquidation may   have   been   contemplated,   discussed, or even  intended prior to May 9,  1968,   they   do   serve to sufficiently undermine  the  conclusions   drawn   by respondent   from   the actions   and   statements to  offset any   presumptions   that   respondent’s   inferences   are   correct.  Without   more   concrete   evidence   than   we   have   before   us,  we   cannot   agree

--- Page 421 ---

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS  with   respondent   that   a plan   of liquidation   of Riggs-Young   was   adopted  within   the   meaning   of section   332   prior   to May   9, 1968.   Lacking   such   a finding,   we   believe   the   date   on   which   the   resolution   to   liquidate   was  actually   adopted   by the   shareholders   should   be controlling. The   very   most   that   can   be   gleaned   from   the   evidence   favorable   to respondent’s   contention   is that   there   may   have   been   a general   intent   on the part of petitioner’s   advisers   somewhere   along the line prior to May   9,  1968,   to   lquidate   Riggs-Young   when   and   if petitioner   achieved   80-  percent   ownership   of Riggs-Young   stock   as   a result   of the   tender   offer. However,   the formation   of a conditional   general   intention   to liquidate   in the   future   is   not   the   adoption   of   a   plan   of liquidation.   City   Bank   of Washington,   supra.  A   mere   intent   by   a   taxpayer-corporation   to   liquidate   a   subsidiary prior to meeting   the   80-percent   requirement   of section   332   should   not be  tantamount   to the   adoption   of a plan   of liquidation   for the   subsidiary   at  the   point   in time   when   that   intent   is formulated   or   manifested.   Such   a  result   would   thwart   the   congressional   intent   of section   332   and   prior  judicial   interpretations   of this   section   and   its predecessor. The   predecessor   of section   332,   I.R.C.   1954,   was   section   112(b)(6), first   enacted   in   1935.   The   purpose   of section   112(b)(6)   was   to encourage  the   simplification   of   corporation   structures   and   allow   the   tax-free  liquidation   of a subsidiary.   * * *  *¥*K*  Based   on   legislative   history   of [Section   112(b)(6)   of the   1939   Code]  and   prior   judicial   decisions,   we   conclude   that   section   332   is elective   in  the   sense   that   with   advance   planning   and   properly   structured  transactions,   a   corporation   should   be   able   to   render   section   332  applicable   or   inapplicable.   The   Commissioner   in   his   regulations   has conceded   corporations   this power   in a seemingly   analogous   situation.   See  sec.   1.337—2(b),   Income   Tax   Regs.  Such   power of planning   presupposes   some right to forethought   and the accompanying intent to achieve the desired goal. It would be a logical inconsistency   equivalent to a “Catch-22” to say that a corporation   has the power to control   the application of   this   section, but   that   once   the corporation   formulates the   intent to do so (assuming that at or subsequent to the time the   intent was   formed, it owned less than the required 80   percent   but enough stock to cause   the   liquidation of  the subsidiary), it has   adopted a plan of liquidation and   has   precluded itself  from the  section.  A basic   tenet   of  our   tax  laws is that a taxpayer   has   the legal right to decrease or altogether   avoid   his   taxes by  means   which the   law   permits.  Gregory v. Helvering,   293   U.S.   465   (1935);   Daniel   D.  Palmer,   62  T.C.   684  (1974).   At  most,   petitioner   did no more   than   follow   this   prerogative.  351

352   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  The   shareholders   of   Riggs-Young   formally   adopted   the plan   of  liquidation   of the   corporation   on   June   20,   1968.   Stokey   testified   that  based   on   the   records   contained   in   his   office   diary,   he   did   not   discuss definite   liquidation   of the   corporation   with   the   corporate   officers   prior   to  June   4, 5, or   6, 1968.   He   concluded   that   he   recommended   liquidation   on  either the 4th or 5th of   June   1968,   and that a definite   decision   to liquidate  was   probably   made   on June   6, 1968.   The   testimony   of Vester   corroborates  these   statements   of Stokey.   We   recognize   that   the   adoption   of a plan   of  liquidation   need   not   be   evidenced   by formal   action   of the   corporation   or  shareholders,   Distributors   Finance   Corp.,   supra.   In   this   case,   however,  we   find   on   the   evidence   that   the   plan   of liquidation   was   adopted   when  the   formal   action   was   taken   on   June   20,   1968.   Furthermore,   even   if it  can   be   said   that   a   plan   of liquidation   was   adopted   when   Stokey   first  recommended   it   to   the   management,   see   Distributors   Finance   Corp.,  supra,   this   occurred   in June   1968   and   would   satisfy   the   requirements   of  section   332. Respondent has cited and relied   on Rev.Rul.   70-106, 1970-1 C.B. 70,  as supportive of his position. This Court is not bound   by a revenue ruling.  Andrew A. Sandor, 62 T.C. 469 (1974). In   addition, we find the facts   of this case are greatly   dissimilar to those contained in the   ruling. The  ruling assumes a prior agreement   between the minority   and   majority shareholders   concerning the redemption of the minority stockholders’  stock. The ruling concludes that   the liquidation plan was   adopted when this agreement was reached. In  the  case at bar, there is no evidence of an agreement   between the minority   and   majority shareholders prior to the tender offer. Madison Square   Garden Corp., supra at 624 n. 4. Since this revenue ruling is inapplicable, proper judicial restraint   dictates   that we do not comment on the   validity or invalidity of the ruling as limited to the facts contained therein. Ronald C. Packard, 63 T.C. 621 (1975).  Decision will be entered for the  petitioner.

CHAPTER   7   COMPLETE   LIQUIDATIONS   353  recognize   gain   or   loss   on   distributions   of property   to   its   parent®4   in   a complete   liquidation   to which   Section   332   applies.   A nonrecognition   rule  makes   sense   in   this   context   because   the   subsidiary’s   tax   attributes,  including   the   built-in   gain   or   loss   in its assets,   can   be   preserved   in the hands   of   the   parent.   Section   334(b)(1)   implements   this   policy   by providing   that   the   parent   takes   a transferred   basis   in property   received from   a   subsidiary   in   a   Section   332   liquidation.   In   keeping   with   this  carryover   of tax   attributes   theme,   the   depreciation   recapture   provisions do   not   override   Section   337,®   and   recapture   potential   continues   to lurk in the   distributed   property   through   the   definition   of “recomputed   basis”  in   Section   1245   and   “additional   depreciation”   in   Section   1250.6   A liquidating   subsidiary   likewise   does   not   recognize   gain   or   loss   on   the  distribution   of installment   obligations   if Section   332   applies,§7   and   the  parent   will   take   a   transferred   basis   in   the   obligations   under   Section  334(b)(1).  Distributions   to Minority   Shareholders.   The   nonrecognition   rule   in Section   337(a)   is limited   to   distributions   of property   by   a   liquidating  subsidiary   to   “the   80-percent   distributee”—1.e.,   the   parent   corporation.  Distributions   to   minority   shareholders   are   treated   in the   same   manner as   a   distribution   in   a   nonliquidating   redemption.   Accordingly,   the  distributing   corporation   will   recognize   gain   but   not   loss.   Recognition   of  gain   is   appropriate   because   minority   shareholders   do   not   inherit   any  built-in   gain   in the   distributed   property   through   a transferred   basis   but  instead   take   a   fair   market   value   basis   under   Section   334(a). Distributions   of loss   property   are   another   matter.   In order   to prevent   a  controlled   subsidiary   from   recognizing   losses   (but not   gains)   by “bullet”  distributions   of loss   property   to minority   shareholders,   Section   336(d)(8)  provides   that no   loss shall be recognized   to a subsidiary   on a distribution  of property   to minority   shareholders   in a Section   332   liquidation.  Transfer   of  Property to Satisfy Indebtedness of Subsidiary to Parent.  Section   337   applies   only to liquidating distributions. If  a subsidiary is indebted to its parent, a transfer of property to satisfy  the   debt normally  would be a taxable   event   rather than a nontaxable distribution governed  by Section 337(a), causing the subsidiary to recognize   gain or loss and the parent to take a  fair market value basis in the   distributed   property. The  disparate treatment of distributions in complete liquidation and transfers of property to satisfy intercorporate   indebtedness   might   tempt  a subsidiary to distribute appreciated   property as part of  the   liquidation  while simultaneously   using loss property to extinguish   any   indebtedness  -to the   parent.   Section   337(b)(1) prevents this ploy by  providing that any  transfer   of property in   satisfaction   of a subsidiary’s   debt to   its parent  64 Section   337(a)   refers to the parent as “the 80-percent distributee,” which is defined in  Section   337(c) as   a corporation   that   meets the   80   percent   stock ownership   requirements specified   in Section   332(b).  6   T.R.C.   §§ 1245(b)(3);   1250(d)(8). 66 T.R.C.   §§  1245(a)(2);   1250(b)(1), (3). 67   [LR.C.   § 453B(d)(1).

354   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  shall   be treated   as   a distribution,   subjecting   the   transfer   to the   general  nonrecognition   rule   of Section   337(a).   As   a necessary   corollary,   Section  334(b)(1)   provides   that   the   parent   takes   a   transferred   basis   in   the distributed   property.  Distributions   to   Tax-Exempt   and   Foreign   Parents.   Ever   vigilant,  Congress   was   concerned   that   taxpayers   might   turn   the   deferral   provided  by Section   337   into   a permanent   exemption   from   the   corporate-level   tax. Consider   the   following   possibility.   A and   B,   the   sole   shareholders   of  highly   appreciated   X Corporation,   wish   to sell the   business   and   avoid   at least   one   level   of tax.   They   sell all their   stock   to tax-exempt   Charity,   Inc.  and   recognize   gain   on   the   sale   or,   if they   are   philanthropic,   they   could  donate   the stock   to Charity   and   take   a charitable   deduction.   Charity   now  owns   100   percent   of the   X   stock   but   it   does   not   wish   to   operate   the  business.   Charity   wishes   to liquidate   X in a tax-free   transaction   at both the   corporate   and   shareholder   levels   under   Sections   332   and   337(a). Although   Charity   must   take   a   transferred   basis   in   the   property distributed   by X, no   tax   ever   would   be collected   on   the   subsequent   sale   of  those   assets   because   Charity   is exempt   from   tax.  This technique might have   been   vulnerable under the   step transaction and other judicial doctrines, but Congress decided to attack it from within the Code.   Section 337(b)(2) thus provides that   the general corporate-level nonrecognition rule for liquidations of a subsidiary shall not apply where the parent is  a tax-exempt organization. Nonrecognition  is restored, however, if the distributed property is used by the tax-exempt  parent in an “unrelated trade or business” immediately after the  distribution.§8   In that   event, there is no loophole to plug because the tax-  exempt organization is subject to tax on its unrelated   business   income .69 A similar rule requires   recognition of corporate-level   gain in the   case of a liquidating   distribution to  a parent that is a foreign   corporation,   except as the Treasury may provide in regulations. The legislative history indicates   that   the regulations   should   permit   nonrecognition if the  appreciation on the distributed property is not being removed from the  U.S.’s taxing jurisdiction   prior to recognition.79   In both   situations where the subsidiary   recognizes   gain or   loss, the parent   takes a fair market value basis in the distributed assets.71  PROBLEMS  cL P, Inc.   (“P”) owns 90 percent of  the outstanding stock of  S, Inc. (S23: Individual (“I”) owns the remaining 10 percent of  S.  P’s basis   in its S stock is  68 Sonat F , .  Exempt organizations may be  taxable on income   from an “unrelated   business”—i.e., a  regularly carried on trade or business activity   that is not substantially   related to the organization's exempt purposes.   See I.R.C. §§ 511 et  seq.  69 If the tax-exempt   parent later disposes of  the  distributed   property or ceases to use it in  an unrelated   trade or business,   any   gain   not recognized on   the   earlier   liquidation becomes taxable as unrelated   business   income.

CHAPTER   8  TAXABLE   CORPORATE  ACQUISITIONS  A.   INTRODUCTION  There   are   many   ways   to   structure   a   corporate   acquisition.   In   the preceding   chapter,   we   previewed   one   method:   a   sale   by   the   target corporation!   of all its assets   followed   by a distribution   of the   proceeds   of sale   to   the   shareholders   in   complete   liquidation   of   the   target.2   An  alternative   is   a   sale   by   the   shareholders   of their   stock   in   the   target corporation.   In either   case,   the business   can   be acquired   in exchange   for  cash,   notes,   stock   or   bonds   of the   acquiring   corporation,   other   property, or   any   combination   of   consideration.   In   an   asset   acquisition,   the  acquiring   corporation   may   purchase   the   assets   directly,   drop   them   down  to a controlled   subsidiary   or   cause   a subsidiary   to make   the   acquisition. In   a   stock   acquisition,   the   target   may   stay   alive   as   a   subsidiary   of the acquiring   corporation   or   liquidate.   Variations   abound   on   these   basic  formats.  Although we   quickly will turn our attention to the  tax consequences of corporate acquisitions, it may be useful at the  outset to consider a few nontax factors   that may influence the form of a transaction.   Stock  acquisitions are usually   simpler to execute than asset   acquisitions. To  sell  its assets, the   target must prepare conveyance documents for many different items of property, give   notice to creditors in compliance with  local bulk sales laws, and incur sales or other local transfer taxes. In a  stock   acquisition, however, it   is unnecessary to transfer any of the target’s   assets; instead,   the acquiring   corporation   simply   buys the  target’s   stock   directly from the T shareholders. A stock purchase thus  may be   desirable (or even essential) if the   target   holds   certain  nonassignable assets, such as   a favorable lease or employment contract, or has   valuable rights under state law that might be jeopardized if the  corporation   were dissolved. On the   other hand, a stock   acquisition may expose the buyer to   liabilities of  the   target   that may be unknown or  contingent at the   time of  the   transaction.   This   threat normally can   be  1 In discussing   acquisitions in this and later chapters,   the acquired   corporation   generally will be called   the   “target,” or “T,” and the   corporate purchaser will be   called   the “acquiring  corporation,” or  “P.” By using the term “target,” we   do  not necessarily mean to suggest that   the acquisition is  a hostile takeover. 2 A target   corporation   that sells   all   or most of its assets   usually will liquidate   and  distribute   the   proceeds to  its shareholders.   Alternatively,   T could   stay   alive   as an investment  company after   the sale.   If T is closely held,   staying alive   likely would   cause it  to be  classified   as a personal   holding   company.   For   the   perils   of  personal   holding   company status,   see Chapter 14D,   infra.   For   the   possibility   of  a  sale   of assets   by a C  corporation   followed   by a conversion to S corporation   status,   see   Chapter   15F,   infra.  357

358   T2 TAXATION   OF   C   CORPORATIONS   PAR  minimized   by warranties   and   indemnity   provisions   in the stock   purchase  agreement.   But   some   buyers   still prefer   to   avoid   the   risk altogether   by  buying   the assets   and   not assuming   any   burdens   that   might   be connected  with   the   corporate   entity.   The   presence   of   unwanted   assets,   the  unwillingness   of minority   shareholders   of the   target   to   sell their   stock,  and   the   requirements   of regulatory   agencies   and   local   corporate   and  securities   law   are   additional   nontax   factors   that may   influence   the choice  of form.  The   principal   tax   issues   raised   on   a   corporate   acquisition   are   best  introduced   by revisiting   the   simple   example   from   the   preceding   chapter.  Recall   that   A is the   sole   shareholder   of Target   Corporation   (“T”) and   has a $100,000   basis   in her   T stock.   T’s only   asset   is a parcel   of undeveloped  land   (“Gainacre”)   with   a   fair   market   value   of   $400,000   and   a   zero adjusted   basis.   Purchaser,   Inc.   (“P”)   wishes   to   acquire   the   land   for  $400,000   cash.   Consider   three   simple   methods   of   structuring   the  acquisition:  (1) Liquidation of T Followed by Shareholder Sale of  Assets. T distributes Gainacre to A in complete liquidation and  then A sells Gainacre to P for $400,000.  (2) Sale of T Assets Followed by   Liquidation. T sells  Gainacre to P for $400,000   and then liquidates, distributing the  after-tax proceeds of sale to A. (3) Sale of T Stock. A sells her T stock to P for $400,000 and P either keeps T alive as a wholly owned subsidiary or  causes T to liquidate and distribute Gainacre to P. Under any of these methods, one would expect A to recognize   gain equal to the  difference between her amount realized on the liquidation or sale   of stock and the $100,000   adjusted basis in her T stock. In  addition, T has $400,000 of corporate-level   gain inherent in Gainacre. Should that  gain also be recognized and, if so, should P (directly or indirectly through  its ownership of T stock) take Gainacre with a $400,000 fair market value  basis? If T does recognize gain, who bears the economic   burden of the  corporate-level tax? Alternatively, can   the transaction   be structured so  that T’s gain is deferred through a zero transferred basis in the land?   Or, perish   the thought, might T’s gain  be permanently forgiven, with P or? if it is still alive), taking   Gainacre   with a $400,000 cost basis? To what extent   do (or should)   the answers to these   questions depend on   the form  of  the transaction? And   how are they affected if the seller is not   an  individual   but a corporation   that owns 100   percent of  the T stock?  The after-tax economic   outcome of these   transactions may differ  radically depending on   the   structure   selected by the   parties. The remainder of   this chapter fills in   the   details,   first considering asset  acquisitions   and   then   stock   acquisitions.

TAX   CONSEQUENCES   TO   THE   PARTIES  A   taxable   asset   acquisition   occurs   when   a   purchaser   (“P”),   which  may   be   an   individual   or   a   business   entity   such   as   a   corporation   or  partnership,   acquires   the   assets   of a target   corporation   (“T”’) in exchange for   cash,   notes,   other   property,   or   a   mix   of such   consideration,   and   the acquisition   does   not   qualify   as   a   tax-free   reorganization   under   Section 368.3   Following   the   sale   of   its   assets,   T   normally   liquidates   and  distributes   the   sales   proceeds   to   its shareholders,   but   the   shareholders  may   choose   to keep   T alive   and   cause   it to reinvest   the   proceeds.   Under  the   corporate   laws   of   most   states,   an   asset   acquisition   also   may   be  accomplished   more   efficiently   by   a   cash   merger   of   T   into   P   (or   a subsidiary   of P). On   the   merger,   T’s   shareholders   receive   cash   or   notes  (or   a   combination)   from   P,   and   T’s   assets   and   liabilities   automatically  transfer   to P (or its subsidiary).   The   Service   views   such   a “cash   merger” as   if T sold its assets   to P and   then   completely   liquidated.4 To illustrate   the tax consequences   of the most   basic   asset   acquisition  methods,   return   again   to   the   example   of A, the   sole   shareholder   (stock  basis—$100,000)   of T, whose   only asset   is appreciated   Gainacre   (basis—  zero;   fair   market   value—$400,000).   Assume   that   C   corporations   are  taxed   at   a flat   20   percent   rate,   and   individuals   are   taxed   at 40   percent on   their   ordinary   income   and   20 percent   on   long-term   capital   gains.5 Liquidation of T Followed by Shareholder Sale of T Assets. If T  distributes Gainacre to A in complete liquidation, it recognizes $400,000 gain under Section   336(a) and incurs a tax liability of $80,000 (20% x $400,000). A bears the economic   burden of the  tax and is obligated to pay it because T has no assets after it liquidates. A recognizes $220,000 gain on the  liquidation ($400,000 distribution less $80,000 corporate-level tax  less $100,000 basis in T stock) and incurs a shareholder-level capital  gains tax   of $44,000   (20% x $220,000). A takes Gainacre with a $400,000 basis under Section   334(a) and recognizes no further   gain on a sale   of Gainacre to P for its fair market value. When the smoke clears, the total  corporate   and   shareholder-level tax   on   the   liquidation and sale is  $124,000,   leaving A with   $276,000. P takes Gainacre with a $400,000 cost  basis   and, if P is a corporation, it does not succeed to the   tax attributes (e.g., earnings   and profits, net operating losses, etc.) of T. Sale   of T Assets Followed   by  Liquidation.   The result is identical if T  -sells Gainacre to P   and   then liquidates. T recognizes   $400,000   gain on  the sale, pays a corporate-level   tax   of $80,000,   distributes   the $320,000 net proceeds to A in complete liquidation, and A again   recognizes  3   See   Chapter   9B, infra. 4 Rev.   Rul.   69-6,   1969-1   C.B.   104.  5 These   assumptions   approximate the   income tax   rates   in  effect   as   this   edition   went to  press   in  2019   and   ignore   the   impact   of the   3.8   percent   tax   on   net   investment   income   and   any  state   taxes.  359

360   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  $220,000   gain under   Section   331(a)   and   incurs   $44,000   of tax on the long-  term   capital   gain.   P takes   Gainacre   with   a $400,000   cost   basis   and   does  not   succeed   to any   of T’s tax   attributes.  Sale   of T Assets   Not   Followed   by Liquidation.   If T does   not   liquidate  after   selling   Gainacre   to P, T once   again   recognizes   $400,000   gain   and incurs   $80,000   in corporate-level   tax,   but   A   does   not   recognize   gain   if T  retains   and   reinvests   the   $320,000   net   proceeds.   Keeping   T alive   defers  and   may   permanently   eliminate   any   tax   at   the   shareholder   level.   For  example,   if A   holds   the   T   stock   until   her   death,   A’s   heirs   will   take   a  stepped-up   basis   in the   stock   under   Section   1014   and   then   may   liquidate  the   corporation   without   paying   a   shareholder-level   tax.   This   “no  liquidation”   strategy   may   have   some   appeal   if A is elderly   and   her   estate  is on   the   verge   of obtaining   a   stepped-up   basis   in the   T   stock,   but   it is rarely desirable   if the liquidation   will be postponed   for many   years.   F irst, the double   tax on   corporate   earnings   must   be navigated   if A wants   access to T’s earnings.®   Moreover,   if T no   longer   conducts   an   ongoing   business, it likely   will   be   classified   as   a   “personal   holding   company.”   As   such,   it will be required   to distribute   its net   investment   income   annually   to A or  face   a penalty   tax   equal   to   20   percent   of any   undistributed   income.8   In  many   situations,   keeping   T   alive   may   be   more   expensive   than liquidating,   although   not   as   expensive   as   it was   before   the   top   tax   rate on   qualified   dividends   was   reduced   to 20 percent.  Conversion to S Corporation. If T chooses to stay alive, it could   avoid  some of the problems just described by becoming an S corporation.   For example, T’s income   would pass through to its shareholders   and be subject to only one level   of tax, albeit at slightly higher marginal rates  for some   high-income individual shareholders.   But as an S corporation, T  would face other obstacles. To name just two,   an S  corporation that was  once a C corporation may lose its S status or be   subject to   a special corporate-level tax if  it has Subchapter   C earnings   and profits and  significant passive investment income .9  2.

The parties to an   asset acquisition   typically negotiate  and agree upon a purchase price based on   the value of   the   target  corporation as   a going   concern.   For tax purposes,   however, a sale   of  the assets   of a going   business for a lump   sum is treated as   a sale   of each  Dividends   received   by T, however,   would qualify for the   50   percent   dividends   received  deduction   under   Section   243(a), and   corporate-level   regular   tax   could   be  avoided   altogether by investing   the  sales proceeds in tax-exempt   municipal   bonds,  7 See   §§ 541 et  seq. and   Chapter 14C, infra.

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS  individual   asset   rather   than   of   a   single   capital   asset.19   This fragmentation   approach   requires   the   parties   to   allocate   the   purchase price   among   the   various   tangible   and   intangible   assets   that   have   been  sold. The   allocation   is used   to determine   the amount   and   character   of the seller’s   gain or loss, and   the buyer’s   cost basis   in each   asset   for purposes  of computing   depreciation   and   amortization   deductions   and   gain   or   loss  on   a subsequent   disposition. The   parties   historically   had   adverse   interests   when   it   came   to allocating   the purchase   price among   the assets.   Buyers   wished   to allocate as   much   as   possible   to inventory,   depreciable   property   and   amortizable intangibles   with   the   shortest   recovery   periods,   and   they   resisted allocations   to   land   and   nondepreciable   goodwill.   Sellers,   by   contrast, benefitted   by allocating   a larger   portion   of the   purchase   price   to assets yielding   a capital   gain   and   less to ordinary   income   assets.   If the   seller is  a   C   corporation,   these   conflicts   diminished   with   the   elimination   of a corporate   capital   gains   rate   preference.   But   buyers   are   still motivated   to  allocate   basis   to   assets   that   provide   depreciation   or   amortization deductions   over   the   shortest   possible   recovery   period,   including   the ability   (through   2022)   to   deduct   100   percent   of   the   cost   of   certain qualified   property   under   Section   168(k),   and   corporate   sellers   with unused   capital   losses   still prefer   capital   gains   over   ordinary   income.  The parties may include a negotiated purchase price   allocation in  their written agreement.   Because buyers   and sellers historically had  adverse interests, negotiated allocations usually   were   respected by the  Service. Indeed, the Service and   some courts generally did  not permit a  party to take a tax reporting position inconsistent   with an agreed allocation   unless the contract was   unenforceable   because of mistake,  undue influence, fraud or duress.!! More often than not, however,  agreements of  sale do  not contain   any purchase price  allocation, allowing  the   parties to go   their separate ways   and possibly “whipsaw” the  government in the process by taking   inconsistent positions. A typical controversy   involved the tension between a covenant not to compete   and  goodwill. Amounts paid by the buyer that are attributable to a covenant  by the seller not to compete with the buyer for   a stated   period of time  result   in ordinary   income to the seller and,   before enactment of Section  197,   the payments were   amortizable   by the buyer over   the life of  the  covenant. Payments for goodwill, on   the   other hand, could   not be  depreciated or amortized   by the buyer before   Section   197 was   added to  the   Code,   and   gain on   the   sale   of goodwill   was capital   gain to the seller.  Thus, sellers preferred   allocations to goodwill,   while   buyers,   craving deductions,   preferred   allocations to  a covenant not to compete. 10 Williams v. McGowan, 152   F.2d   570   (2d Cir.1945). 11 Commissioner v. Danielson,   378   F.2d   771   (3d Cir.1967), cert. denied,   389   U.S.   858,   88  S.Ct.   94   (1967).   Other   courts,   using a more   lenient   standard,   permitted a party to override a  contractual   allocation   by a showing   of  “strong proof” that the  agreement   should   not  be respected.  See,   e.g., Ullman v. Commissioner,   264   F.2d   305   (2d Cir.1959).  361

362   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Even   without   a   covenant   not   to   compete,   some   of   the   most  contentious   allocation   controversies   have   involved   the   amount   properly attributable   to   goodwill   and   the   going   concern   value   of   an   acquired business.   The   allocation   is critical   to   a buyer   who   pays   a premium—.e., an   amount   that   exceeds   the fair market   value   of the   target’s   identifiable  tangible   and   intangible   assets.   At   one   time,   the   Service   permitted   the  “proportionate”   method   of   allocation,   under   which   the   value   of each acquired   asset   (including   intangibles   such   as   goodwill)   was   determined,  and   then   the   aggregate   purchase   price was   allocated   in proportion   to the relative   fair market   value   of each   asset.   The   proportionate   method   often  had   the   effect   of shifting   any   premium   paid   for   the   business   toward  depreciable   and   amortizable   assets   and   away   from   nondepreciable  goodwill.   The   future   tax   benefits   that   resulted   from   this   buyer-friendly  allocation   method   were   a stimulus   to the corporate   takeover   mania   of the  1980s.  Under another   valuation   approach, known as the residual method,  each tangible and intangible asset (excluding   goodwill and going   concern value) is valued first. If the   overall   price paid for the business   exceeds the aggregate fair market value of these assets, the   excess   (“residue”) is allocated to goodwill and going   concern value. The   impact of the residual method is to allocate more of the total purchase price to goodwill and going  concern   value as compared to the proportionate method. In  the  case of a “bargain   purchase,” where the  price paid for the business is less than the fair market value of T’s assets, nothing is allocated to goodwill and the amount allocated to the   identifiable   assets   (other than cash, cash  equivalents and marketable securities) is proportionately   reduced. Congress first moved to regulate purchase price allocations in  connection   with stock purchases that are treated as asset acquisitions  under Section   338 by directing the Treasury to prescribe   regulations governing allocation of basis among the   target’s   assets.12 Not unexpectedly, the regulations mandated use of the residual method. Eventually, Congress   extended this approach to asset acquisitions by enacting Section   1060, which includes   reporting requirements to protect  the   Service from   being whipsawed.   Congress took another step toward certainty   with the enactment of Section 197, which requires the cost   of most   acquired   intangible assets, including a covenant not to compete, to be amortized over   15   years. Because a buyer’s ability to amortize intangible   assets and the timing of that amortization affects the economic stakes of a purchase price allocation,   an overview of Section   197 is useful before turning to the specific requirements of Section   1060.  Amortization   of   Intangibles:   Section 197. Section   197   permits taxpayers to amortize many intangible   assets   ratably   over a 15-year period,   regardless of  their   actual   “useful life”   or recovery   period   under  prior   law. Amortizable   “Section   197   intangibles”   include   information  12   I.R.C. § 338(b)(5).   See   Section   C2 of this   chapter,   infra.

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS  bases,   customer   and   subscription   lists, patient   files, know-how,   licenses,  franchises,   trade   names   and,   notably,   goodwill,   going   concern   value   and  covenants   not   to compete   entered   into   in connection   with   an   acquisition  of all or   a substantial   part   of a trade   or business.!3   Some   of these   assets,  such   as   goodwill   and   going   concern   value,   were   not   amortizable   at   all  under   prior   law,   while   others   were   being   written   off   over   periods  considerably   shorter   than   15   years.   Amortization   under   Section   197   is available,   however,   only   for   acquired   intangibles;   it is   generally   not permitted   for assets   that   are   created   by the   taxpayer.1!4  Section   197   puts   to rest   many   of the   most   contested   tax   issues   in the  area   of business   acquisitions.   Litigated   disputes   abounded   under   prior  law, including   one   case   in which   the Supreme   Court   held   that “customer- based”   intangibles   (primarily   subscriber   lists) acquired   by a publisher   on  the   purchase   of   a   newspaper   were   amortizable   if   they   had   an ascertainable   value   and   a   determinable   useful   life.15   Rejecting   the Service’s   argument   that   such   intangibles   were   “nondepreciable   per   se,” the   Court   concluded   that   eligibility   for amortization   turned   on   whether the asset   was   capable   of being valued   and whether   that value   diminished over   time.!6   The   Court’s   approach,   and   the   factual   controversies   that   it necessarily   engendered,   are   now   largely   moot   with   the   enactment   of  Section   197.  Allocation   of Purchase   Price:   Section   1060.   The   ability   of the   parties to make   strategical   purchase   price allocations   has   been   reduced   with   the enactment   of Section   197   and   the   Section   1060   basis   allocation   rules.  Section   1060   applies   to any   “applicable   asset   acquisition,”   defined   as any  transfer   (direct   or   indirect)   of   assets   which   constitute   a   “trade   or  business”   in   the   hands   of   either   the   buyer   or   the   seller,   and   the  purchaser’s   basis   in   the   purchased   assets   is   determined   wholly   by  reference   to the   consideration   paid for the   assets.17   This   broad   definition  goes   well   beyond   the   typical   corporate   asset   acquisition,   extending   to sales   of sole proprietorships   and   partnership   interests. Section   1060   requires the buyer   and seller to allocate   the total consideration received or paid for a business among the various transferred assets using the  residual method   previewed above.!®   For this purpose,   “consideration   received” is the seller’s aggregate amount realized from the sale   of its assets determined   under general tax principles, and   “consideration   paid” is the   buyer’s   aggregate cost   of purchasing the   assets   that is properly   taken into account in determining basis.19 Thus, liabilities assumed   by the buyer or  to which the transferred  13   T.R.C.   § 197(c)(1),   (d). 4   L.R.C.   § 197(c)(2).  15 Newark   Morning   Ledger Co. v.

Aggregate   consideration   is   then   allocated   among   the   assets   using   a  refined   version   of the   residual   method   that   places   all “acquisition   date  assets”   into   one   of seven   classes   and   allocates   the   consideration   among  those   classes   in priority   order.2   In general,   the   amount   allocated   to an  asset   (except   for   the   last   “residual”   category)   may   not   exceed   its   fair  market   value.2!   Specifically,   total   consideration   is first   reduced   by cash and   cash   equivalents   (known   as   “Class   I   acquisition   date   assets”) transferred   by the seller.22   The   remaining   consideration   is then   allocated  first   to   highly   liquid   assets   such   as   actively   traded   personal   property (e.g.,   marketable   securities),   foreign   currencies,   and   certificates   of  deposit   (Class   II assets)   in proportion   to their   fair market   values,   then   to accounts   receivable,   mortgages,   and   credit   card   receivables   (Class   III),  then   to inventory   and   other   dealer-type   property   (Class   IV),   then   to   all  assets   other   than   those   in the   other   classes   (Class   V—a   broad   category  that   includes   most   tangible   assets,   such   as   equipment   and   real   estate),  and   finally   to   all   Section   197   intangibles   except   goodwill   and   going concern   value   (Class   VI).   Any   remaining   consideration,   such   as   in acquisitions   where   the purchase   price includes   a “premium”   that exceeds the   liquidation   value   of the   tangible   and   intangible   assets   acquired,   is  allocated   to Class   VII,   a category   limited   to goodwill   and   going   concern value.23 Effect of Agreement Between the Parties. As first enacted,   Section  1060 did not address the question of whether the  parties to  a transaction should be bound by any written agreement they   reach regarding allocation of the purchase price. Concerned that taxpayers might  continue to take reporting positions   that were   inconsistent   with their  agreements,   Congress amended Section 1060 to provide that a written  agreement governing the   allocation of consideration in   an applicable  asset acquisition shall be binding on both parties unless the Treasury determines that the allocation (or fair market value) is not appropriate. 24 The regulations   provide that a party may refute   an agreed allocation or  valuation   only by proving that   the agreement was unenforceable   due to  mistake, undue influence, fraud or duress.25 This is the standard long  advanced   by tha Service and   applied by the Third Circuit   in the Danielson case In holding the   parties to their agreement,   however, Congress made it clear that it did   not intend to restrict the   Service’s  20 Reg. § 1.1060-1(c)(2). The Section   1060   regulations   incorporate by reference the  residual method used under Reg. § 1.338-6 for certain   stock   acquisitions   that are treated as  asset acquisitions under Section 338. Id.  21 Reg. § 1.338-6(c)(1).  22 Reg. § 1.338-6(b)(1).   In  the unusual case where the total consideration to be   allocated  is less than the amount of Class   I assets, then   the purchaser   must   immediately recognize  ordinary   income to that   extent.

STOCK   ACQUISITIONS  1.   BACKGROUND  In   a taxable   stock   acquisition,   the   purchaser   (“P”) buys   the stock   of  a target   corporation   (“T”) from   T’s shareholders   for cash or a combination  of cash,   notes   and   other   consideration.   A   taxable   stock   acquisition   may be   structured   as   a reverse   triangular   merger,   in which   P forms   a wholly owned   transitory   subsidiary   (“S”),   and   S merges   into   T under   state   law, with   T’s shareholders   receiving   cash   and   debt   obligations   of P. When   the  dust   settles,   T is   a wholly   owned   subsidiary   of P.  Acquisitions of public companies are almost always stock acquisitions. They are sometimes   launched when P begins   acquiring T  stock in the open   market.31 The next step may be a cash   tender offer   to T’s shareholders or   a friendly merger negotiated   with T’s management. If P succeeds in acquiring control of T, the final step is usually a “back- end” merger   where recalcitrant minority   shareholders are squeezed out of the   picture, sometimes for the same price   originally   offered to  tendering   shareholders or perhaps on less attractive   terms.32 27 H.Rep.

366  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Whether the transaction is structured as   a direct stock purchase or  a reverse triangular   cash merger,33 T’s shareholders recognize gain or loss on the sale of  their stock, measured by the   difference between their  amount realized and stock basis, and P takes a cost basis in the T stock  it acquires. T shareholders who receive   notes generally may report their  gain on the installment method if the T stock is not publicly  traded.34 The more difficult conceptual questions relate to the   tax consequences to T  and the impact of a stock acquisition on the   basis of T’s assets and T’s  other tax attributes. Should a stock acquisition   be treated as if it were a  taxable   asset-acquisition coupled with a liquidation of T, or should the  form of the transaction control? Should the parties be permitted to select which   treatment they would prefer? Not   surprisingly,   Congress   has   exhibited   considerable   hyperactivity  in answering   these   questions.   The   Kimbell-Diamond   case,   which   follows,  is the   best   place   to   begin   describing   the   evolution   of the   current   tax treatment   of stock   acquisitions.  Kimbell-Diamond   Milling   Co.   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Tax   Court,   1950.  iS   E,W.  = BLACK,   JUDGE.  [In August, 1942, taxpayer’s milling   plant was   destroyed by fire and  two months later the taxpayer collected insurance as a reimbursement  for its loss.   It then purchased for approximately   $210,000 cash all the  stock of Whaley Mill & Elevator Co.   in order to use Whaley’s plant and  equipment to replace its own destroyed facilities. The   purchase price  consisted of $120,000 of insurance   proceeds   and   $90,000 of additional  funds. The taxpayer’s sole intention in purchasing   Whaley’s stock was to acquire the assets   of  the company through a prompt liquidation.  Taxpayer liquidated Whaley three days after acquiring the stock. In a prior proceeding,   reported at 10   T.C. 7, the Tax   Court held   that   the  acquisition of Whaley came within the 1939 Code   predecessor of § 1033 so that   the taxpayer’s   gain on   the involuntary   conversion   was not  recognized.   Since   the taxpayer’s   acquisition of the Whaley stock   qualified  under § 1033, its basis was   $110,000 (the sum of the $20,000   adjusted  basis   of  the destroyed assets and the $90,000 of additional   funds that  were   paid in addition to the insurance proceeds). The assets of Whaley  acquired   by the taxpayer in   the   liquidation had an adjusted basis to  33 A reverse   triangular   cash merger is treated for tax purposes as if P purchased   T stock  directly from the shareholders.

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS  Whaley   of more   than   $300,000;   the   depreciable   assets   represented   about  $140,000   of this   total.  The   central   dispute   in   the   case   was   over   the   taxpayer’s   basis   for depreciation   in   the   assets   acquired   in   the   Whaley   liquidation.   After addressing   a procedural   issue,   the Court   proceeded   to discuss   the merits.  Note   that   this   case   arose   under   the   1939   Code,   which   did   not   contain  former   § 334(b)(2)   or   present   § 338.   Ed.]  **R*  OPINION  Having   decided   the   issue   of res judicata   against   petitioner,   we   must now   determine   the   question   of petitioner’s   basis   in Whaley’s   assets   on  the   merits.   Petitioner   argues   that   the   acquisition   of Whaley’s   assets   and the   subsequent   liquidation   of   Whaley   brings   petitioner   within   the provisions   of [the predecessor   of § 332]   and,   therefore,   by reason   of [the  predecessor   of § 334(b)(1)],   petitioner’s   basis   in these   assets   is the   same  as   the basis   in Whaley’s   hands.   In so contending,   petitioner   asks   that   we  treat   the   acquisition   of Whaley’s   stock   and   the   subsequent   liquidation   of  Whaley   as   separate   transactions.   It is well   settled   that   the   incidence   of taxation   depends   upon   the   substance   of a transaction.   Commissioner   v.  Court   Holding   Co.,   324   U.S.   331.   It   is   inescapable   from   petitioner’s  minutes   set   out   above   and   from   the   “Agreement   and   Program   of Complete   Liquidation”   entered   into between   petitioner   and   Whaley,   that the   only intention   petitioner   ever   had   was   to acquire   Whaley’s   assets.  We think that this proceeding is governed   by the   principles of Commissioner v. Ashland Oil & Refining Co., 99  Fed. (2d) 588,   certiorari  denied,   306 U.S. 661. In   that case   the   stock was retained for almost a  year   before   liquidation. Ruling on the question of whether the   stock or the   assets of the corporation   were   purchased, the court stated:  The question   remains,   however, whether if the   entire transaction, whatever its form, was essentially in   intent, purpose   and result, a  purchase   by Swiss of property, its several   steps may be   treated  separately   and   each be   given an effect   for tax purposes as though each constituted a distinct transaction. *  * * And without   regard to whether the  result is imposition or relief from taxation,   the courts have   recognized that where the   essential nature of a transaction is the   acquisition of property, it will be viewed as   a whole, and closely   related   steps will not be separated either at the   instance of   the taxpayer or the   taxing  authority.   Prairie   Oil & Gas Co. v. Motter, 10 Cir., 66   F.2d   309; Tulsa Tribune Co. v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 58   F.2d   937,   940; Ahles   Realty  Corp. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 71  F.2d   150; Helvering v. Security   Savings  Bank,   4 Cir., 72   F.2d 874. *  * *  See   also Koppers   Coal Co., 6  T.C.   1209   and   cases   there cited.  We hold   that   the   purchase of  Whaley’s   stock   and its subsequent liquidation   must   be considered as  one   transaction,   namely,   the  purchase  367

368  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  of Whaley’s assets which was petitioner’s sole intention. This was not a reorganization within section 112(b)(6), and petitioner’s basis in these  assets, both depreciable and   nondepreciable, is, therefore, its cost, or  $110,721.74 ($18,921.90, the basis of petitioner’s   assets destroyed by fire, plus $91,799.84, the amount expended over the insurance proceeds). Since   petitioner   does not controvert respondent’s allocation of cost to the individual assets acquired   from Whaley, both depreciable and nondepreciable,   respondent’s allocation is sustained.  **Ke*  NOTE  If   the   stock   purchase   and   subsequent   liquidation   of   the   target-  subsidiary   in Kimbell-Diamond   had   been   treated   as   separate   transactions,  the buyer   would   have   taken a (higher)   transferred   basis   in the target’s   assets  under   Section   334(b)(1).   The   court   looked   to the   buyer’s   intent,   however,   in holding that the stock purchase   was   merely a transitory   step in a transaction that   was   properly   characterized   as   a   purchase   of   assets.   Under   this application   of the step transaction   doctrine,   the liquidation   was   disregarded, and   the buyer   took a cost   basis   in the   assets. In   the 1954   Code, Congress replaced the   elusive   intent standard of Kimbell-Diamond with a more objective test.35 If a corporation purchased a controlling (80 percent or more) stock   interest in the   target corporation and then   liquidated the target within a specific period of time,   the acquiring corporation   was treated as if  it had purchased the target’s   assets. In general, the acquiring   corporation took a cost basis in the   assets equal to what it paid for the   stock rather than the usual   transferred basis   that   results from the liquidation of a controlled   subsidiary. Although more “objective” than  Kimbell-Diamond, the 1954 Code rules were   laden   with   timetables, control  and   “purchase” requirements   and a_ host of adjustments for cash  distributions, liabilities assumed and   transactions   occurring after the  acquisition   but prior to the  liquidation. Additional problems were   created by the requirement that   the buyer liquidate   the newly acquired target in order to secure a Kimbell-Diamond cost basis in the  target’s   assets.36 Congress   responded to these   deficiencies by enacting Section 338, which  refines   the Kimbell-Diamond concept by allowing the acquiring   corporation  to  elect   to treat certain   stock purchases as asset purchases.   Unlike   Kimbell- Diamond and the   prior statutory scheme, Section   338   does not require a corporate buyer of stock to liquidate   the  target to get a cost  basis   in its assets. This is convenient when the buyer   wishes to keep the   target alive as   a subsidiary. Under current   law, a corporation   that   acquires   control (i.e., at least 80   percent) of a target   corporation in a transaction   that is taxable to the  selling shareholders is thus   presented   with   four basic   choices. It may: (1) not make the   Section   338   election and   keep T alive, leaving T’s bases in its  35 1.R.C. § 334(b)(2)   (pre-1982).  36 For historians   and   masochists, see Bittker & Eustice,   Federal   Income   Taxation of  Corporations   and   Shareholders {| 11.45   (5th  ed.   1987).

CHAPTER   8   :   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS  assets   and   other   tax   attributes   unaffected;   (2) not   elect   under   Section   338, liquidate   T tax-free   under   Section   332   and   inherit   its asset   bases   and   other  tax   attributes;37   (8) make   the   Section   338   election   and   treat   the   transaction as   an   asset   acquisition   under   which   “new   T” takes   a cost   basis   in its assets and   is purged   of all of its prior   tax   attributes;   or   (4) make   the   election   and  then   liquidate   T, inheriting   the   cost   basis   in the   assets   but   not   any   of “old  T’s” tax   attributes.38 Before   proceeding   further,   it is important   to keep   in mind   that Kimbell-  Diamond   and   Section   338   originated   long   ago   in the   General   Utilities   era,  when   liquidating   distributions   and   sales   generally   did   not   trigger   a  corporate-level   tax.   The   principal   question   then   confronting   a   corporate buyer   of stock   was   whether   to take   a cost   basis   or   a transferred   basis   in the  target’s   assets.   If T’s assets   were   appreciated,   a well   advised   corporate   buyer  would   make   the   Section   338   election   in   order   to   obtain   a   stepped-up   cost  basis   in the   target’s   assets   at little or no   corporate-level   tax   cost.   The   stakes  are   vastly   different   under   current   law,   where   liquidating   sales   and  distributions   generally   are   taxable   events.   If a stock   purchase   is treated   as  an   asset   acquisition,   the   target   must   recognize   gain   or   loss,   and   one   of the parties   (buyer   or   seller,   or   both)   must   bear   the   economic   burden   of   the corporate   tax   imposed   on   any   gain.   Accordingly,   the   Section   338   election   is undesirable   in virtually   all cases   where   the   target’s   assets   are   appreciated  because   it rarely   makes   economic   sense   to elect to pay   tax currently   in order to   step   up   the   basis   of assets   and   avoid   tax   later.   Section   338   nonetheless  survives   in the   1986   Code,   along   with   reams   of intricate   regulations,   and   it  remains   an   attractive   option   in a few   situations   that   are   discussed   below.  2.   OPERATION   OF   SECTION   338  Code:   §§ 338(a), (b) (omit (b)(3)), (d),  (e)(1), (2)(A) & (D), (g), ()Q), (2), (3)(A), (4)(A), (5), (6)(A), (9), (11).  Regulations: §§  1.338—4(a), (b)(1) & (2), (c), (d)(1), (e), —5(a), (b)1) & (2),  (c), (d)(1), (e)(1)-(8).  Overview of Section 3388. Section   338 is   a complex statutory mechanism that   seeks to equate for tax purposes the purchase of  an   80  percent or more interest in the   stock of the target.corporation   with a purchase of the   target’s   assets. In   general,   the   goals are to: (1) ensure that   the   target and its shareholders bear the same tax burden on a sale of  the   target’s   stock   that they would   have   incurred on a sale of its assets followed by a complete liquidation; (2) provide the buyer   with a cost basis  in   the   assets   of  the   target; and (3) terminate the   tax   attributes of  the  target   and start   afresh, without   regard to whether or not   the   target is actually   liquidated.  37 Note that   the   tax treatment of  this method is contrary to Kimbell-Diamond,   which  would   have   treated a stock purchase   followed   by a prompt   intended   liquidation of  the   target as  an   asset   acquisition,   giving   P a   cost   basis   in   T’s   assets   rather   than a transferred   basis   and,  under   current   law,   causing   T to recognize   gain or  loss   on   the   sale.  38 TT  or   P’s   ability   to   utilize   T’s   net   operating   losses   in  the first two   situations   may   be  limited.   See   I.R.C.   §§  269(b);   382;   and   Chapter 12, infra.  369

PART   2 370   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS  To achieve these goals, Section 338 provides that if a purchasing corporation (“P”) purchases 80 percent or more of the   stock of a target  corporation (“T”) within 12 months or less, it may elect to treat T as having sold all of its assets for their fair market value in a single transaction.39 T   must recognize   gain or loss on the hypothetical asset sale, after which it returns as   a virgin corporation (“new T”) with a cost  basis in its assets and none of its former tax attributes.4° If T is  liquidated, this   cost basis simply carries   over to the parent under the rules governing liquidations of a subsidiary.*!  The   contours   of Section   338   are   easier   to explain   than   its details.   The  section   is   littered   with   anti-avoidance   provisions,   many   of   which   are  aimed   at   maneuvers   that   are   beyond   the   scope   of   this   book.  Understanding   Section   338   is eased   by focusing   on   its fundamentals. Qualification   for Section   338.   The   Section   338   election   is available only   to a “purchasing   corporation,”   which   is defined   as   “any   corporation  which   makes   a   qualified   purchase   of stock   of another   corporation.”’42   A “qualified   stock   purchase”   is a   transaction   or   series   of transactions   in  which   one   corporation   acquires   by “purchase”   an   80   percent   controlling  interest   in another   corporation   during   a 12-month   “acquisition   period.”43 Roughly   translated,   all of this means   that   P must   buy at least   80 percent of the stock of T within   a 12-month   period in transactions   that are   taxable  to the   selling   shareholders.#44  The Election. If  a corporation makes a qualified   stock purchase   and  desires to make the Section   338 election, it must do so no   later than the  fifteenth day of the ninth month beginning after the month in which the “acquisition date”   occurs.45 The acquisition   date is the day within the 12-  month  acquisition   period on which the   80 percent purchase   requirement  is satisfied.46 Once   made, a Section   338 election is irrevocable.47 There is no turning back,   even   with the Commissioner’s permission, if the   results prove to be  undesirable.  Effect of Election: Deemed Sale of Target Assets and   Termination of  Old Target’s   Existence. If P makes a qualified   stock purchase   and follows  up with a timely   Section   338 election, T is treated as having sold all of its  43  by refere  the total 44  recogniti  LR.C.   § 338(a).

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS  assets   at the close   of the   acquisition   date   for their   “fair   market   value”   in  a single transaction   and   is treated   as   a new   corporation   which   purchased  all of its assets   as of the beginning   of the day after the acquisition   date.48  As   a result,   T recognizes   gain   or   loss   on   this   hypothetical   sale, just as   if  it actually   had   sold its assets.49 be or purposes   of this deemed   sale,   Section  338   provides   that   T is not   treated   as   a member   of an   affiliated   group   if it  otherwise   might   have   been.5®   Although   the   income   realized   on   the deemed   asset   sale   may   not   be   combined   with   the   income   of P   or   its affiliates   for   tax   purposes,   the   economic   burden   of   the   tax   liability resulting   from   the   deemed   sale is indirectly   borne   by P, which   will factor  it into the price to be paid for the stock.   On   the day after the deemed   sale, T is reincarnated.   It returns   as   a new   corporation   with   no   earnings   and profits   or   other   tax   attributes   from   its pre-deemed   sale   era   and   with   a  cost   basis   in the   assets   that   it hypothetically   purchased   from   its former  self.51   If all this   talk   about   deemed   transactions   seems   mysterious,   keep in   mind   that   it is simply   the   mechanism   used   by   the   Code   to   equate  purchases   of assets   and   stock   when   a Section   338   election   is made. Aggregate   Deemed   Sale   Price.   In   the   hypothetical   asset   sale  triggered   by a   Section   338   election,   T is treated   as   selling   its assets   for their   “aggregate   deemed   sale price”   (“ADSP”).5?   This   is easy   to determine  if 100   percent   of T’s stock   is purchased   in one   transaction   and   not   as easy  if the stock purchases   do not occur   within   12 months   or P does not acquire  all of T’s stock.   In general,   ADSP   is the sum:   of (1) the grossed-up   amount realized   on   the   sale   to   P   of P’s   recently   purchased   T   stock,   and   (2) the  liabilities   of   old   T,   including   tax   liabilities   from   the   deemed   sale.5%  ‘Recently   purchased   stock”   is T   stock   purchased   by   P   during   the   12-  month   acquisition   period   and   held   by P at the   time   of the   qualified   stock  purchase.®4   Thus,   if P   purchased   all of T’s   stock   during   the   12-month acquisition   period,   the   ADSP   is the   total   amount   realized   by the   selling T shareholders   plus old T’s liabilities. If P   purchased less than 100 percent of T’s outstanding shares during the 12-month acquisition period, then the concept of “orossed-up”  amount realized comes into   play. The   grossed-up amount realized is an  amount equal to the amount realized on   the sale to P of P’s recently  purchased   T stock without   regard to costs   of sale, divided by the  48   T.R.C.   § 338(a).  49 See   Section B1 of this chapter,   supra.  50 T.R.C. § 338(h)(9). This means that   losses   of P or any P affiliate or losses   of a corporate parent or   affiliate of   T may not be   used to shelter   gains   resulting   from T’s deemed asset sale,  but T  may deduct its own net operating losses against the   gains   from the deemed sale. See   Reg.  § 1.338-1(f)(3)(iv). A “consolidated deemed sale return” may be filed, however,   by all target corporations   acquired   by a purchasing   corporation on   the same acquisition   date if the   targets  were members of  the same selling consolidated   group.   I.R.C. § 338(h)(15). Cf.  I.R.C. § 338(h)(10) and   Section   C3 of  this chapter, infra.  51   .R.C.   § 338(a)(2).  52   Reg.   § 1.338—4(a).  53   Reg.   § 1.338—4(b)(1),   (d). 54.

372  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2 percentage of T stock   (by value) attributable to that recently purchased  stock, less any selling costs (such as brokerage commissions) incurred by  the selling T shareholders in connection with their   sale of recently  purchased stock   that reduce their amount realized.>5 The function of this  complex formula in situations where   P does not acquire 100 percent of T  stock is to approximate the total amount that would have   been realized  on the sale of T stock if P had purchased all the shares at the same  average price that P paid for the shares actually purchased during the acquisition period. To illustrate, if during the 12-month acquisition period P  purchased 80 percent of T’s outstanding stock for $800,000, the grossed-up amount realized on the sale to P of P’s recently purchased   T  stock would be $800,000/.80, or $1,000,000.  Remember   that   the theory   underlying   Section   338   is to replicate   the tax   consequences   of an   asset   acquisition.   If   P were   to purchase   all of T’s assets,   the   purchase   price   would   reflect   any   T   liabilities   assumed   or property   transferred   subject   to   liabilities   as   part   of   the   transaction.  Under   the   principles   of the   Crane   case,   T’s   amount   realized   in   such   an  asset   sale   would   include   the   amount   of   those   liabilities.   In   a   stock purchase,   the   amount   paid   by   P   for   T’s   stock   similarly   will   take   into account   the debts   and liabilities   on T’s balance   sheet   as of the “acquisition date.”   To   properly   determine   the   deemed   sale   price   of T’s   assets   under Section   338,   the   ADSP   is increased   by liabilities   of old   T, including   tax liabilities,   that   properly   would   be taken   into   account   as   amount   realized on   a disposition   by T of its assets   to an   unrelated   purchaser   who   assumed  the   liabilities   or took   assets   subject   to a liabilities   of old T.56  Determination of  Asset Basis After Deemed Purchase. New T’s basis  in its assets has been   described as a Kimbell-Diamond type cost basis,  but the   actual approach used to determine the aggregate basis and allocate it among T’s assets is not quite that  simple. The regulations label  new ‘ls basis as the “adjusted   grossed-up basis” (‘AGUB”).57   The AGUB generally is the sum of: (1) the grossed-up basis in  P’s recently purchased  T stock, (2)  P’s basis in nonrecently purchased   T stock (e.g., T stock owned by  P before   the 12-month acquisition period), and (8) liabilities of new T,  including   any tax liabilities triggered by the deemed sale.58 AGUB is similar   but not necessarily identical to ADSP. If P holds   only   recently purchased stock in T and T has no contingent liabilities, the two calculations   usually produce the same result.  55   Reg.   § 1.338—4(c¢)(1).  56   Reg.   § 1.388—4(d)(1).   General   tax   principles   control   the   time   that   liabilities   are   taken into   account.   See Reg. § 1.338—4(d)(2).   Since   determination   of the   ADSP   may   depend,   in part, on   the   tax   lability triggered   by the   deemed   sale,   and   old T’s tax   liability   depends   on   the ADSP, the calculation 1s potentially   circular.   The   regulations   recognize   that the determination   of ADSP may   require   trial   and error   computations.   Reg.   § 1.338-4(e).   They   also   include   examples   of a formula   to resolve   this   mathematical   teaser,   To   revisit   high   school   algebra,   see   Reg.   § 1.838— 4(g) Examples.   :  57   Reg.   § 1.388—5(a).  58   Reg. § 1.338-5(b)(1).

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS   373  To   illustrate,   assume   again   that   during   the   12-month   acquisition period   P purchased   80 percent   of T’s outstanding   stock   for $800,000   and assume   P   does   not   own   any   other   T   stock.   In   computing   ADSP   and AGUB,   the   grossed-up   amount   realized   and   the   adjusted   grossed-up  basis   are   both   $1,000,000.59   But   if   P owns   nonrecently   purchased   T stock  with   a per-share   basis   different   than   P’s basis   in its recently   purchased  stock,   the   calculation   of the   ADSP   for   old   T’s   assets   and   the   AGUB   for  new   T’s   assets   will   produce   different   results.69   The   difference   is attributable   to   the   fact   that   the   ADSP   formula   treats   P’s   nonrecently purchased   stock   the   same   as   stock   that   is held   by T shareholders   other  than   P, while   the   AGUB   formula   uses   P’s actual   basis   in its nonrecently  purchased   T   stock.   P   can   make   an   election   to   recognize   gain   on   its nonrecently   purchased   T stock.®!   If such   an   election   is made,   the   sum   of  the   grossed-up   basis   in P’s   recently   purchased   T stock   and   P’s basis   in any   nonrecently   purchased   stock   will   equal   the   ADSP.®?   The   election,  however,   requires   P   to   currently   recognize   gain   on   its   nonrecently  purchased   T   stock,   and   so   it   usually   is   not   desirable   from   a   tax  standpoint. Allocation   of Adjusted   Grossed-up   Basis   Among   Target   Assets.   If P makes   a   Section   338   election,   new   T’s   aggregate   AGUB   is   allocated  among   its assets   under   regulations   promulgated   under   Section   338(b)(5).  These   regulations   utilize   the   same   seven-class   system   and   reporting requirements   previously   discussed   with   respect   to   basis   allocations   in asset   acquisitions.® Consistency Rules. Section   338   allows a purchasing corporation to take a transferred basis in T’s assets   (by not making the election) or, at  the cost of a tax   on any   gain (or deducting   any loss) inherent in the  target’s   assets, to take   essentially a   fair market value basis in those assets. When Section   338   was enacted, the consistency requirement was designed to ensure that P was put to a choice: it could select one or the  other, but not both (or some of each) of these options. To   achieve that objective, Section 338(e) was   intended to prevent P from   acquiring some assets from T or an affiliate of   T with a cost basis and other assets with a transferred basis during a “consistency period”   that begins one   year before   the start   of  the   acquisition   period and   extends to one   year after  the   acquisition date.64 Under Section 338(e), if P acquired   such an   asset from T during the consistency period, it was deemed to make a Section  59 For ADSP, see Reg. § 1.338-4(c); for AGUB, see Reg. § 1.338—5(b), (c).  60 Contingent liabilities that are taken into account in determining a seller's amount  realized   but are not   yet properly   included in a purchaser's basis   also may be  the   source of  an initial disparity   that   usually will be   corrected by later adjustments. See, e.g., Reg. § 1.338—  5(b)(2) (ai).  61 J.R.C.   338(h)(3). Losses on nonrecently   purchased stock   are   not   allowed.   Reg. § 1.338—  5(d)(3) (ii).  62   See   Reg.   § 1.838-5(d)(3).  63 See   Section   B2   of  this  chapter,   supra;   Reg.   § 1.338-6.  64   T.R.C.   § 338(h)(4)(A).

374   RT   2 TAXATION   OF C CORPORATIONS   PA  338 election with respect to the purchase of T’s stock, unless T sold the  asset in the ordinary course of its business (e.g., a routine sale   of  inventory) or P took a transferred basis in the asset. Section 338(f) was  designed to ensure that if P makes a qualified   stock purchase with  respect to T and one or more affiliates (e.g., a wholly owned subsidiary) of T during   any   consistency period, then all such qualified stock purchases   must be treated consistently under Section 338;   an   election  with respect to the first applies to all later qualified   stock purchases and  if no election is made for the first purchase,   none may be made for later  ones.  In   the   final   Section   338   regulations,   the   Treasury   significantly  narrowed   the   reach   of the   consistency   period   rules   because   they   were designed   to patrol   against   exploitation   of the   long   ago   repealed   General  Utilities   doctrine.   Under   the   regulations,   the   asset   consistency   rules   of  Section   338(e)   generally   apply   only   if P acquires   an   asset   directly   from T   during   the   consistency   period   and   T   is   a   subsidiary   of   another corporation   (“S”)   in   a   consolidated   group.6*   Under   the   regulations,   the  stock   consistency   rules   of   Section   338(f)   are   now   limited   by   the regulations   to preventing   avoidance   of the   asset   consistency   rules.§7  Understanding the limited application of the   asset consistency period rules requires a very basic knowledge of the consolidated   return regulations, which generally permit a parent   corporation in a  consolidated   group to increase the basis for its stock in a subsidiary when  the subsidiary   recognizes a taxable   gain on the sale   of one of its assets.68 The relationship of this rule to Section   338 is best   illustrated by the following example provided by the Treasury   where P is the purchasing  corporation, T is the   target and S is T’s parent:69 The   proposed regulations   apply the consistency rules   in the  context of consolidated   groups to prevent acquisitions from being   structured to take advantage of the investment adjustment rules. If the consistency rules   did  not apply in such  a case, P could   acquire assets from T with a stepped-up basis in  the assets, and   then   acquire the T stock at no additional cost to  the S group.  Example.   S  and T file a consolidated return. S  has a $100x basis in the T stock, which has a fair market value of $200x. On January 1, 1993, T sells an   asset to P   and   recognizes $100x of  gain. Under § 1.1502-32 [of the consolidated   return regulations], S’s basis   in  the T stock is increased   from   $100x to  6° I.R.C. § 338(e)(2)(A) and (B).  86 Reg. § 1.338-8(a)(2). The rules   are   also extended to  a few  other   limited abuse cases   that are well beyond the coverage of  this  text.

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS   375  $200x.   On   March   1, 1993,   S sells   the   T stock   to P for $200x   and  recognizes   no   gain   or loss. The   consistency   rules   of the   proposed   regulations   apply   to the   transaction   because   T’s   gain   on   the   asset   sale   is reflected  under   § 1.1502—32   in   S’s   basis   in the   T   stock.   However,   under  the proposed   regulations,   the District   Director   no   longer has   the discretion   to   impose   a   deemed   section   388   election   for   T. Instead,   under   proposed   [regulation]   § 1.838—4(d),   P   takes   a carryover   basis   in any   asset   acquired   from   T.   (This   is referred to as   the   carryover   basis   rule).  Section   338   Election   Coupled   with   Liquidation   of T. If P purchases  80   percent   or   more   of T   stock,   makes   a   Section   3388   election,   and   then  promptly   liquidates   T, the   stock   purchase   and   subsequent   liquidation   of  T are   accorded   independent   significance   for tax   purposes—i.e.,   they   are  not   stepped   together   and   treated   as   an   integrated   transaction.   P   is treated   as   having   made   a qualified   stock   purchase   rather   than a direct  acquisition   of   assets   under   the   Kimbell-Diamond   doctrine.7®   On   the  liquidation,   P   recognizes   no   gain   or   loss   under   Section   332,   and   T recognizes   no   gain   or   loss   on   the   distribution   of its   assets   to   P   under  Section   337.   In   any   event,   neither   P   nor   T   would   have   any   significant  realized   gain or loss because   at least   80 percent   of the T stock would   have been   recently   purchased,   and   any   built-in   gain   on   T’s   assets   was  recognized   as   a   result   of the   Section   338   deemed   asset   sale.   After   the  liquidation,   P succeeds   to T’s fair market   value   basis   in its assets.  Stock   Acquisitions   Without Section 338 Election. The tax  consequences of an acquisition of 80 percent or more of T’s stock with no Section   338 election are less complicated. T’s shareholders, as always,  recognize   gain or loss on the sale   of  their   stock.   T becomes a subsidiary of P and retains its tax   attributes, including the historic   basis in its  assets, earnings   and profits, and the like. If P subsequently liquidates   T,  or T   merges into P or another   P subsidiary,   neither P nor T recognizes  gain or  loss, and T’s asset bases and other   tax attributes   carry   over to the  transferee.7!   Significantly,   the initial qualified   stock purchase   and subsequent liquidation of T (or merger of T into P or a P affiliate) are not  treated as an integrated   transaction (e.g., as   a direct purchase of T’s  assets by P) even if  all the   steps were   planned   from the   outset. If the  transactions   were   integrated, T would recognize   gain or loss on its assets, a result which is fundamentally inconsistent   with P’s decision   not to  make a Section   338 election. The extent to which T (if  it stays alive) or P -(if it liquidates   T) may utilize   T’s net operating losses   after   the  7   Reg. § 1.338-3(c)(1)(i).   See also   Rev.   Rul.   90-95,   1990-2 C.B.   67   (stating   that   “Section 338   replaced   the Kimbell-Diamond doctrine’). 7   Rev.   Rul.   90-95,   supra   note   70.

376   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  acquisition   is likely   to be limited   by Section   382,   which   is examined   in a later   chapter.72  3.   ACQUISITION   OF   STOCK   OF A SUBSIDIARY  Section   838(h)(10)   Election.   The   previous   discussion   assumed   that   T  was   not   a   subsidiary   of   another   corporation.   Consider,   however,   the situation   where   T is a wholly   owned   subsidiary   of Seller,   Inc.   (“S”),   and P wishes   to   acquire   T. Assume   that   the   value   of T’s   stock   (and   also   its  underlying   assets)   is $400,000;   S has   a $100,000   basis   in its T stock;   and  T   has   a   $100,000   aggregate   basis   in   its   assets.   T   could   sell   its   assets  directly to P for $400,000   in a taxable   transaction   and   then   distribute   the  sales   proceeds   to S in a tax-free   liquidation   under   Section   332,   with   the  net   result   being   $300,000   of   taxable   gain   to   T   on   the   asset   sale.  Alternatively,   T could   distribute   the assets   to S in a tax-free   liquidation.  S would   take   the   assets   with   a $100,000   transferred   basis   under   Section  334(b)   and   recognize   $300,000   gain   on a sale   to P. In either   case,   S does  not recognize   gain or loss   on   its T stock,   and   P acquires   the   assets   with   a  $400,000   cost   basis.   If the   disappearance   of S’s   $300,000   gain   on   its   T  stock   seems   inconsistent   with   the   double   tax   regime,   remember   that   no assets   have   yet   been   distributed   out   of   corporate   solution   to   the  shareholders   of S, the   real   people   who   own   the   enterprise.   The   policy   is  to avoid   three   levels   of tax   on   what   may   be a single   economic   gain. Now assume that for nontax reasons P  must acquire T’s stock. Under general tax   principles, S  would recognize   gain or loss on the sale   of its T  stock and   P would take the   stock with a cost basis. If   P makes a Section  338 election, T also is treated as having sold its assets in a taxable  transaction. If P does not elect, the bases of  T’s assets are unchanged and  any built-in gain or loss is preserved.   Either   way, the   result is double corporate-level gain, with the potential of a third round of taxation when  S distributes   the sales proceeds to its shareholders. Section   338(h)(10) offers   relief from this potential triple tax by  permitting the   parties to ignore S’s sale   of its T stock and treat the  transaction as   if it were a sale   of T’s assets.73 If a Section   338(h)(10) election is made,74 old T is deemed to have sold its assets to an unrelated person   (new T) while a member of the S  consolidated group, and   then to  have distributed its assets (i.e., the proceeds of sale) to S and   ceased to exist. In most cases,   the final step   of   the various   hypothetical transactions is treated as   a tax-free   liquidation of T  under Sections   332  72 See Chapter 12,  infra, and   LR.C. § 269(b).  78 In   general, before   the transaction T   must be a member of  “the sellin i  : trans g  consolidated group.” LR.C. § 338(h)(10)(A). A selling consolidated   group” is any   group of corporations   which files a consolidated   return.   See   generally   Reg.   § 1.338(h)(10)—1(b)(3).  ™ The   election   must   be  made jointly by  the  S group   and P.  See Reg.   §  1.338(h)(10)—1(c)(2).

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS  and   337.75   The   tax   consequences   of the   election   are:   (1) S recognizes   no gain or loss on   the   sale of its T stock;   (2) S inherits   T’s tax   attributes   (e.g., earnings   and   profits);76   (3) T is deemed   to have   sold   its assets   for their fair   market   value   in   a   taxable   transaction,77   and   any   gain   or   loss   is included   on   the   consolidated   return   filed   by S and   its affiliates;   and   (4)  “new   T,” a subsidiary   of P, is treated   as having   acquired   old T’s assets   for  an   amount   equal   to   their   adjusted   grossed-up   basis.78   Two   levels   of corporate-level   gain   are   thus   avoided,   and   the   tax   burden   of the   sale remains   with   the   seller.  Returning   to the   example,   if the   parties   make   a   Section   338 (h)(10)  election,   S’s   $300,000   gain   on   the   sale   of its T   stock   is ignored,   and   the $300,000   gain   on   the   deemed   sale   of   T’s   assets79   is   included   on   the  consolidated   tax   return   filed   by S and   its affiliates.   P takes   a   $400,000  cost   basis   in the   T stock   and   “new   T” takes   a $400,000   basis   in its assets.  Although   the   Section   338(h)(10)   election   is   generally   desirable  because   it eliminates   two   levels   of corporate-level   gain,   it has   particular  allure   when   S has   a large “outside”   gain on its T stock relative   to minimal “inside”   gain on   T’s assets.   In that   scenario,   P may   purchase   T’s stock   at  little or no   tax   cost   to S if the   parties   make   a Section   338(h)(10)   election. Of course,   the   same   result   could   have   been   achieved   if S first liquidated T under   Section   332   and   sold   the   assets   to P, but   this   method   might   not  be   feasible   if   P needs   to   keep   T   alive   as   a   corporate   entity   for   nontax  reasons.  The election also is attractive when S’s consolidated   group   has losses  that   can   be  applied to offset any gain recognized by T on the deemed sale of its assets. If Section   338 were elected without an accompanying Section  338(h)(10) election, T   must file a separate one day return   reporting the  income from the deemed sale and it could not offset its gain   with   any  losses from S’s other   operations. If a Section   338(h)(10) election is made,  however, the gain on the deemed sale is reported on S’s consolidated return and may be offset by losses   of S and its other affiliates. The regulations   extend the   availability of the Section   338(h)(10) election to two   additional situations. First, they  permit the  election when  T and § are   affiliated corporations   even if T is not a member of the S  consolidated   group if S sells stock representing at  least 80 percent of  the  75   See   Reg.   § 1.338(h)(10)—1(d).  76 These inherited tax   attributes   generally are reduced in proportion to the percentage of  old T stock   held by  minority   shareholders. Cf. Reg. § 1.381(c)(2)—1(c)(2). 77 The deemed sale   price is determined   under a formula   prescribed   by the   regulations, which refers to the  actual purchase price  paid  by P for the T stock and is adjusted for liabilities  of  T. See   Reg.   §§  1.338(h)(10)—1(d)(3)(@); 1.338—-4.  78 J.R.C. § 338(b). The   adjusted   grossed-up basis   for new T’s assets is determined   under Reg. §  1.338—5   and is allocated among the   assets under the approach   discussed earlier   in this chapter.   Reg.   § 1.338(h)(10)—1(d)(2).  79 We   have   assumed for convenience   that   the deemed sale   price  equals   the   $400,000 fair  market   value   of T’s assets.  377

If   Tis an   S corporation,   the gain   on   the   deemed   sale   of   T’s   assets   is   reported   on   old   T’s   final   S corporation   return   and   passes   through   to   T’s   shareholders,   who   may  make   appropriate   adjustments   to   the   basis   of   their   T   stock.82   These  adjustments   will affect   the   gain   or loss   recognized   by these   shareholders on   the   deemed   liquidation   of old   T,   and   no   additional   gain   or   loss   is recognized   on   the   actual   stock   sale.   The   taxation   of S corporations   and their   shareholders   is examined   in Chapter   15.  4.   SECTION   336(e)  Section   336(e)   is a close   relative   of Section   338(h)(10).   In some   cases, it   is   an   identical   twin.   Section   336(e)   provides   that,   upon   the  promulgation   of regulations,   a corporation   that   owns   at least   80   percent  of the   voting   power   and   value   of the   stock   of another   corporation   may  elect to treat   a sale, exchange   or distribution   of that   subsidiary’s   stock   as if it were   a   disposition   of the   subsidiary’s   assets.   If a   Section   336(e)  election   is   made,   the   parent   does   not   recognize   gain   or   loss   on   the  disposition   of the   subsidiary’s   stock.   The   legislative   history   of Section  336(e)   states   that   “principles   similar   to those   of Section   338(h)(10)”   will be used   in determining   the   operation   of the   Section   336(e)   election.83 The overlap between Sections 336(e) and 338(h)(10) is apparent when a parent sells the   stock of a controlled subsidiary to   a corporate purchaser. Section 336(e) is potentially broader, however,   and could  apply even if the buyer were an individual or entity (such as a  partnership) that is not qualified to make a Section   338 election.  Moreover, Section 336(e) is not confined to sales. It potentially  encompasses both   liquidating and even nonliquidating distributions of the   stock of a subsidiary. Section 336(e) was an empty shell without the further details that  Congress left to the Treasury to develop through regulations. In 2013, a mere 27   years after Section   336(e) was enacted, the Treasury finally  issued the eagerly awaited regulations.84 They permit a corporation   with  “control”   of another   corporation (“T”)  to make an   election to treat certain  sales, exchanges,   and distributions of T stock as taxable sales   of   T’s  assets. The regulations also provide   useful guidance on   the   scope of  Section 336(e), its relationship to Section   338(h)(10), and the  requirements for and   mechanics of a Section   336(e)   election. 80 Reg.   §§  1.338(h)(10)—1(c)(1),   —1(b)(3),   —1(d)(4). $1 Reg.   §§ 1.338(h)(10)-1(c)(1),   —1(b)(4),   —1(d)(4).  82 Reg. § 1.338(h)(10)—-1(d)(5)(i).  83 H.R.Rep.

CHAPTER 8 TAXABLE CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS 379  For   most   purposes,   the   regulations   utilize   principles   established under   Section   338(h)(10)   except   certain   familiar   definitions   have   been modified   to   reflect   the   greater   breadth   of Section   336(e).   For   example, they   use   the   term   “disposition”   rather   than   “acquisition”   or   “purchase” and   “sale,   exchange   or   distribution”   instead   of   just   “sale.”   Thus,   a  “qualified   stock   purchase”   under   Section   338   is   a   “qualified   stock  disposition”   under   Section   38386(e).   The   regulations   use   the   term “ageregate   deemed   disposition   price”   instead   of “aggregate   deemed   sales price”   but   retain   the   much   beloved   “adjusted   grossed   up   basis.”   The   new term   “nonrecently   disposed   stock”   has   a meaning   similar   to “nonrecently  purchased   stock”   in Section   338.85   To avoid   overlap,   the regulations   make  it clear   that   a   transaction   satisfying   the   definition   of “qualified   stock purchase”   in Section   338(d)(3)   is governed   exclusively   by Section   338   and  does   not   qualify   for a Section   336(e)   election.®¢  To   make   a   Section   336(e)   election,   the   seller’?   must   own   stock   in a domestic   C   corporation   meeting   the   requirements   of Section   1504(a)(2)  (generally,   80   percent   of   voting   power   and   value)   and   must   sell, exchange,   or distribute   (including   combinations   thereof)   all of such   stock meeting   the   control   requirement   during   a   12-month   disposition   period. Thus,   some   portion   of T stock   may   be retained   by the   seller   or   a member  of the   seller’s   consolidated   group.   Any   stock   disposed   of to   a   “related party”   does   not count   for purposes   of determining   whether   there has been  a qualified   stock   disposition.   The   regulations   also permit   a Section   336(e)  election   to be made   when   an   S corporation   is the target,   as long has   been  permitted   for   a   Section   338(h)(10)   election.88   A   Section   336(e)   election will not be effective   unless   the   seller   and   the target   (acting   as   a proxy   for  the   purchasers)   enter   into   a   written   binding   agreement   to   make   the  election   and both   the   seller   and   target   corporations   attach   Section   336(e) election   statements   to their   tax   returns.®9 In   the case   of a sale or exchange of T stock where a Section 336(e)  election is made, the regulations treat Old T as   if it sold all its assets to an unrelated   corporation (New T) at the close   of the   disposition   date in exchange for the aggregate deemed disposition price   (generally,   the amount realized on   the sale of the stock, adjusted for  liabilities). Old T is then   treated as having   completely liquidated into New T.% If T stock is distributed as part of a qualified   stock   disposition,   the transaction is treated as   a sale   of Old T’s assets to New T,  followed by a liquidation of 85 See   generally   Reg. § 1.336—1(b);   1.336—3. 86   Reg.   § 1.336—1(b)(6)(4i).  87 For this purpose, “seller” means any   domestic   corporation   that makes a qualified   stock  disposition   and   includes   both a transferor   and   distributor   of  target stock. Reg. § 1.336—1(b)(1).  88 Reg. § 1.336—1(b)(3).   See   Chapter   15G1, infra, for more on how Section   336(e)   elections  are used in connection   with   acquisitions   of S  corporations.  89   Reg.   § 1.836—2(h).  9   Reg.  §  1.336—2(b)(1)()(A),   —2(b)(1)  Gi), —2(b) (1) Gi).

380  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Old   T and   a deemed   purchase   of New T   stock   by the   seller   followed   by a tax-free   distribution   of that   stock   to the   seller’s   shareholders.?!  The   regulations   provide   limited   relief   from   the   strict   limitation   on  the   recognition   of   losses   imposed   by   Section   311(a).   They   generally  permit   Old   T to deduct   losses   realized   on   the   deemed   sale   of its assets   up  to the   realized   gains   triggered   by a   Section   336(e)   election.9?   But   if the  target   corporation   has   a net   loss   on   the   deemed   asset   sale,   that   loss   is permanently   disallowed   in proportion   to   the   portion   of the   target   stock  that   was   disposed   of by the   seller   in one   or more   distributions   during   the 12-month   disposition   period,   whether   or   not   the   distribution   was   part   of  a   qualified   stock   disposition.9?   The   Section   336(e)   regulations   have   lots  of additional   details,   specific rules   for various   corporate   transactions,   and  numerous   examples.   They   are   not   light reading. With   this   fascinating   survey   completed,   the   question   remains—so  what?—or,   put   differently,   what   value   does   Section   336(e)   add   as   a  planning   tool?   Here   is   the   basic   answer.   Section   336(e)   applies   to  distributions   of T   stock   as   well   as   sales   and   to   a   combination   of sales, exchanges   and   distributions,   and   a   Section   336(e)   election   is available  even   if the   purchaser   is not   a corporation.   By contrast,   Section   338   does not   apply   to distributions   or when   T stock   is acquired   by a noncorporate purchaser.   Thus,   Section   336(e)   is best   viewed   as   extending   the   reach   of  the principles   embodied   in Section   338(h)(10)   to situations   where   Section  338   does   not   specifically   apply.   A   Section   336(e)   election   provides  taxpayers   with   an   additional   option   when   planning   transactions   that may   be   structured   (or   deemed   structured)   as   either   a   disposition   of a target’s   assets   or a sale   of its stock.  D. COMPARISON OF ACQUISITION METHODS  A typical student’s   reaction to this chapter (or indeed the   entire  course   up to now)   might be something like this: “After considerable effort, I understand the workings of most   Code sections as they are studied, but the   course is becoming a conglomeration of random detail.” The   lament might continue   with   these   questions   about   taxable   corporate acquisitions: “How does it all fit together? Does it matter whether   P buys  T’s assets or stock? What rational buyer ever would make the Section   338  election? Does   substance control   over form—or form over substance? When does   the   step transaction   doctrine   apply?”   In   short,   the  understandable plea is—“Give   me   some perspective!”   This   section  attempts to respond   by  comparing taxable   acquisition methods in a tax  planning context, and   by  providing a comprehensive taxable   acquisitions problem. 1 Reg. § 1.336-2(b)(1)(iv). %   Reg. § 1.336-2(b)(1)(i)(B)(2)(i). %   Reg.  § 1.336-2(b)(1)(i)(B)(2)(i)-(iv).

CHAPTER 8 TAXABLE CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS 381  The   repeal   of the   General   Utilities   doctrine   greatly   altered   the   tax  economics   of   corporate   acquisitions.   Prior   to   that   time,   the   tax consequences   of an   asset   purchase   followed   by a complete   liquidation,   or a stock   purchase   coupled   with   a Section   338   election,   were   essentially   the  same.   T’s   shareholders   recognized   a capital   gain   on   their   investment;   T  did   not   recognize   gain   or   loss   on   the   actual   or   deemed   transfer   of its assets   except   for recapture   of depreciation   and   a few   other   items;   and   P  (or “new   'T”’) obtained   a   fair   market   value   basis   in T’s   assets.   In   short,  taxable   acquisitions   involved   only   a single,   shareholder-level   tax,   which  could   be deferred   if P used   installment   notes   as   partial   consideration   for  the   purchase.  After   General   Utilities   repeal,   an   asset   acquisition   is much   more  expensive.   It   requires   both   T   and   its   shareholders   to   recognize   gain unless   T does   not   liquidate.   A stock   purchase   coupled   with   a Section   338 election   is   no   better   because   the   deemed   asset   sale   results   in   full recognition   of corporate-level   gain.   In either   case,   P obtains   a fair market  value   basis   in T’s assets—but   at the price of an   immediate   corporate-level  tax.   Corporate-level   tax   is avoided,   however,   if P purchases   T’s stock   and  does   not   elect   under   Section   338.   It is perhaps   ironic   that,   after   years   of effort   to   equate   the   tax   treatment   of   different   corporate   acquisition methods,   we   are   left   with   an   asymmetrical   system   under   which   asset  acquisitions   require   two   levels   of tax   with   no   opportunity   for T to defer tax   through   a   transferred   basis,   while   a   stock   acquisition   without   a Section   338   election   requires   only a shareholder-level   tax,   albeit with   the trade-off   of a transferred   basis   in T’s assets. It follows   that the preferred   alternative   for most   taxable   acquisitions is a stock   purchase   with   no   Section   338   election.   It is rarely   desirable   to pay   a front-end   corporate   tax   on   the   gain   inherent   in T’s   assets   in order to   achieve   tax   savings   later   from   the   additional   depreciation,  amortization   and   other   deductions   that   would   flow   from   the   stepped-up  basis   in T’s assets.   The   two   principal   exceptions   are:   (1) where   T has large net   operating   loss   carryovers   that   would   be   available   to   offset   the   gain  recognized   on   the   deemed   asset   sale;   and   (2) where   T is a subsidiary   of  another   corporation.  The prospect of a two-tier   tax   also may tilt the method of choice in  corporate   acquisitions more   towards tax-free reorganizations, where neither T nor its shareholders   currently   recognize   gain or loss, but tax  attributes at both the corporate   and   shareholder levels   are preserved  % These lingering   discontinuities are discussed in  Zolt, “The   General Utilities Doctrine:  Examining the Scope of Repeal,”   65 Taxes 819 (1987);   Yin, “A   Carryover Basis Regime?   A  Few  Words of Caution,”   37 Tax   Notes   415 (1987); and   Lewis,   “A  Proposal for  a Corporate   Level Tax on Major Stock Sales,”   37 Tax   Notes   1041 (1987). 95 These losses   are   available,   subject   after 2017 to the   80   percent of  taxable   income limitation, to  offset   the   gain  on   T’s deemed asset sale.   I.R.C. § 172(a)(2).   If P  acquired   T and did  not   elect under   Section   338,   T’s NOLs   would not   be  purged   but   they likely would   be limited   in the future   under   Section   382.   See   Chapter 12, infra.  9   See   I.R.C. §  338(h)(10)   and   Section   C3   of this  chapter,   supra.

Finally,   these   tax   stakes   and   planning   decisions   may   be   affected   by  several   key   provisions   of the   Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs   Act,   including:   (1) the  reduction   of the   corporate   income   tax   rate   to 21   percent;   (2) the   repeal   of the corporate   alternative   minimum   tax;   and   (8) the opportunity   to deduct  100   percent   of the   cost   of that   portion   of the   purchase   price   allocated   to  most   depreciable   tangible   personal   property.97   In some   situations,   these  favorable   developments   may   tip the   scales   in favor   of a taxable   sale   of  .assets   for cash,   or   a deemed   asset   sale   resulting   from   a   Section   338   or  Section   338(h)(10)   election.

CHAPTER 8 TAXABLE CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS 383  T and   its shareholders   are   considering a sale of the business.   Purchaser  Corporation   (“P”)   is interested   in   acquiring   T.   If specific   computations   are required   by your   instructor,   assume   (for computational   convenience)   that   C  corporations   are   taxed   on   all   their   income   at a   flat   corporate   rate   of 20  percent   and   individuals   are   taxed   at a flat 40 percent   rate on ordinary   income  and   a 20 percent   rate   on   long-term   capital   gains   (and   ignore   the   3.8 percent  tax   on   net   investment   income).  What   are   the   tax   consequences   of the   following   alternative   acquisition  methods   to T, T’s shareholders,   and   P?  (a)   T adopts   a plan   of complete   liquidation,   sells   all of its assets   -»   (3 O0I¢   — Sook   - 27k  (except   the cash   but   subject   to the bank   loan)   to P for $800,000   =~  cash,   and   distributes   the after-tax   proceeds   to its shareholders in proportion   to their   stock   holdings. (b)   T   adopts   a   plan   of complete   liquidation,   distributes   all of its assets   (subject to the liability) to its shareholders   in proportion  to   their   stock   holdings,   and   the   shareholders   then   sell   the  assets   (less   any   cash   but   subject   to   the   bank   loan)   to   P   for  $800,000.  (c)   In general,   how   would   the   result   in (a), above,   change   if P paid T   $200,000   in   cash   and   $600,000   in   notes,   with   market   rate  interest   payable   annually   and   the   entire   principal   payable   in  five years? (d)   T sells   all of its assets   (except   for the   cash   but   subject   to the bank   loan) to P as in (a), above,   except   that T does not liquidate and   instead   invests   the   after-tax   sales   proceeds   in a portfolio of publicly   traded   securities.  (e) P purchases all the   stock of T for $900 per share and makes a  § 338 election. (Why didn’t P pay   $1,000 per share for the T  stock?)  (f) P  purchases all the   stock of T for cash   but   does not make the  § 338 election. (Consider   generally what   P should   pay for the  T stock.) (g) Assuming P  and T are indifferent to the form of  the transaction except for the impact of   taxes, would you recommend the acquisition method in (a) (purchase of assets), (e) (purchase of  stock with § 338 election) or (f) (purchase of   stock without  § 338 election), above?  (h) Would your recommendation in (g), above, change if T   had  $600,000 in fully deductible net operating loss carryovers? (i) Assume that T is a wholly-owned subsidiary of  S, Inc., and   S  has a $200,000   adjusted basis   in its T stock. What result if T  distributes all of its assets   (subject to the liability)   to S in  complete   liquidation,   and S then sells the   assets to P? (j) Same as (i), above,   except   P insists   that   the   transaction   must be structured as   an   acquisition   of  T stock.

384  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  2.   Should   Congress   enact   legislation   that   treats   taxable   asset   and stock acquisitions   consistently   for   tax   purposes?   If so,   what   are   its   options   and  which   would   you   support?  3.   X Corp.   owns   98 of the   100   outstanding   shares   of T Corp.   common   stock  (the   only   class   outstanding).   The   other   two   shares   are   owned   by unrelated  shareholders.   T has   assets   with   both   gains   and   losses;   assume   the amount   of  the   gains   exceeds   the   amount   of the   losses.   In   Year   1, X   engages   in   the following   transactions.   On   March   1, it sells   30   shares   of T stock   to unrelated  A for cash;   on   April   1, it sells   10 shares   of T stock   to R, a related   individual;  on   July   1,   it   distributes   50   shares   of   T   stock   to   X   Corp.’s   unrelated  shareholders;   and   on   December   1, it sells   5 shares   of T stock   to unrelated   B.  The   value   of T stock   on   July   1 is $100   per   share.  (a)   Maya   § 336(e)   election   be made   and,   if so, by whom? (b)   Assuming   that   a   § 336(e)   election   may   be   made,   what   are   the tax   consequences   to all relevant   parties.  EK. TAX TREATMENT OF ACQUISITION EXPENSES  The   expenses incurred in connection with a corporate acquisition may be   substantial. Both the purchaser (“P”) and the   target C12)  ordinarily must pay fees to lawyers, accountants   and investment bankers. P may incur additional expenses to obtain   debt and equity financing, and T may be   obligated to secure an opinion stating   that   the  proposed acquisition is “fair”   to T and its shareholders. In virtually all cases, the   central tax question becomes   whether the expenses are  currently deductible, amortizable, capitalized and   added to the basis of a  particular   tangible or intangible asset, or treated as   a permanent  nondepreciable capital expenditure.  The tax treatment of P’s expenses are relatively settled. Costs of obtaining debt financing (such as fees for negotiating the   loan and  drafting   loan documents, up-front commitment fees and other fees paid  to the   lender) generally must be amortized over   the term of the   loan to  which the expenses relate.9 Likewise,   expenses of obtaining   equity  financing (e.g., to register newly issued stock, prepare offering  documents, etc.) are treated as permanent capital expenditures that are neither   currently   deductible nor amortizable.99   Costs   attributable to the  acquisition of particular T assets or T stock (e.g., legal expenses for  drafting   an acquisition agreement, closing costs, finder’s   fees)   also   are capital expenditures   and   must be added to the   basis   of  the acquired property.'°° If P  forms a new   subsidiary to carry   out   the   acquisition,   the  organizational   expenses are currently   deductible   (up to $5,000,   but  reduced as   total expenses   exceed   $50,000),   with   any   excess   over   the  98 Rey.   Rul. 70-359,   1970-2 C.B.   103;   Rev.   Rul. 70-360,   1970-2 C.B.   103. 9   Rev.   Rul. 69-330,   1969-1 C.B. 51.  100 If P   acquires T’s   stock   and   makes a Section   338 election,   these   capital expenditures become part of  new T’s adjusted   grossed-up   basis   and   may be   allocated among T’s   assets   in  accordance   with   the rules   in  Sections   338(b)(5)   and   1060.   See   Reg.   §  1.338(b)—1(g)(1).

CHAPTER 8 TAXABLE CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS 385  deductible   amount   amortizable   over   15 years   if P elects   to apply   Section 248.   In addition,   P may   attempt   to classify certain   expenses   related   to an  acquisition   as   normal   business   expenses.   Examples   would   include  expenses   related   to   employment   agreements,   executive   compensation  and   retirement   planning,   tax   planning,   and   the   annual   retainer   paid   to  an   investment   banker   that   may   have   helped   arrange   the   acquisition.  The   tax   treatment   of T’s   expenses   has   been   more   controversial.  Assume   for   example   that   the   target   in   a   friendly   corporate   takeover  incurs   legal,   investment   banking   and   other   fees,   including   the   cost   of  obtaining   an   opinion   that   the   terms   of the   acquisition   are   fair   to T and its   shareholders.   Are   these   expenses’   currently   deductible   by   T   as ordinary   and   necessary   businesses   expenses   under   Section   162   or   must  they be capitalized?   In INDOPCO,   Inc. v. Commissioner,1®!   the   Supreme Court   held   that   investment   banking   fees   and   other   expenses   incurred   by  a   target   corporation   in   a   friendly   takeover   were   nondeductible   capital expenditures   because   they   produced   significant   long-term   benefits,   such  as   the   availability   of   the   acquiring   corporation’s   resources,   the opportunity   for   synergy,   and   the   benefits   resulting   from   the   target’s  transformation   from   a public   company   to a wholly   owned   subsidiary.   In ruling   for   the   government,   the   Court   held   that   the   creation   or enhancement   of   a   separate   or   distinct   asset   was   not   controlling   in  resolving   capital   expenditure   classification   questions.   In   so   doing,   it rejected   the   taxpayer’s   reliance   on a line   of appellate   decisions   that   had interpreted   the   Court’s   opinion   in   Commissioner   v.   Lincoln   Savings   &  Loan   Association!®2   as   adopting   a   test   under   which   creation   or enhancement   of an   asset   is a   prerequisite   to   capitalization.   The   Court  clarified   its earlier   decision   in Lincoln   Savings,   stating   that   the   creation of a separate   and   distinct   asset   may   be a sufficient   reason   for capitalizing  an   expense   but   not   an   essential   prerequisite.   It   noted   further   that  Lincoln   Savings   did not   prohibit   reliance   on   “future   benefit”   as   a test for  distinguishing   an   ordinary   business   expense   from   a capital   expenditure.  However,   the   Court   conceded   that   an   “incidental   future   benefit”   may   not  require   capitalization   but   that   the   taxpayer’s   realization   of   benefits  beyond   the   year   in which   the   expenditure   was   incurred   is an   important  factor   in   distinguishing   ordinary   business   expenses   from   capital expenditures. Soon after it was decided, commentators   began to focus   on   the potential   ripple effect   of   the Supreme Court’s INDOPCO decision— specifically whether the   Court’s reasoning   would be imported to deny _deductibility of various   other   expenses.   The Service   has calmed   most of these   nerves, first in a series   of rulings   confirming the   current  101 503   U.S.   79,  112   S.Ct.   1039   (1992). 102 403   U.S.   345,   91   S.Ct.   1893   (1971). ©

386  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  deductibility   of many   expenditures!93   and   more   recently   in   extensive  taxpayer-friendly   regulations. 14 INDOPCO   involved   a friendly   takeover.   Should   expenses   incurred   to  resist a hostile   takeover   be treated   differently?   The   contexts   in which   this issue   arises   include   both   defending   against   a   hostile   takeover   by   a  corporate   raider   and   arranging   for   a   taxable   acquisition   by   a   friendly “White   Knight”   buyer.   The   cases   so far indicate   that   the tax treatment   of such   expenditures   may   depend   on   the   eventual   outcome   of   the transaction.   In   In re   Federated   Department   Stores,   Inc.,%   a   corporate taxpayer,   faced   with   a hostile   offer, arranged   a White   Knight   transaction  and   agreed   to pay   “break-up”   fees   to the   White   Knight   if the   merger   fell through.   Eventually,   the hostile   bidder   was   successful   and   the   break-up fees   were   paid   to   the   White   Knight.   A   federal   district   court   in   a  bankruptcy   proceeding   held   that   the   fees   were   currently   deductible  under   either   Section   162   or   Section   165   (as   costs   incurred   in   an  abandoned   transaction).   Distinguishing   INDOPCO,   the   court   found   that  the   fees   were   incurred   to   defend   the   business   against   attack   and   not   to restructure   the corporation   in hopes   of some   future   benefit.  In A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co. v. Commissioner,!°6 the Tax Court considered a situation where a corporation   incurred   $23 million in investment bankers’ fees and printing costs to respond to a series   of hostile tender offers for its stock. The company’s board of directors  declined   two offers but eventually   accepted a third bid. Rejecting the  taxpayer's argument that INDOPCO was   distinguishable because the  takeover in Staley was hostile, the Tax   Court held   that   the fees and costs  were nondeductible   because   they   were   incurred in connection   with a  change in the ownership of the taxpayer that “portended strategic changes *** with long-term consequences”   and   were capital in  nature, 107  On appeal,   the Seventh Circuit reversed   and   permitted the   target corporation to deduct   most of the expenses it incurred in resisting a hostile takeover.108 The court reasoned that INDOPCO did   not change  the law   with   respect to costs incurred to defend a business   because those  expenses   were to preserve the   status quo,   not to produce future benefits.  108 See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 95-32, 1995-16 LR.B. 5 (expenditures by a public utility   for the  implementation and   operation of energy   conservation   and load management programs are deductible under Section 162); Rev.   Rul. 94-77, 1994-2 C.B.   19 (severance payments to employees are generally   deductible under Section 162); Rev. Rul. 94-38,   1994-1 C.B.   35 (costs to clean   up   land and treat groundwater   contaminated   by  taxpayer are deductible under Section  162); Rev.   Rul. 94-12,   1994-1 C.B.   36 (incidental   repair costs   are deductible under Section 162); Rev.   Rul. 92-80, 1992-2 C.B.   57   (advertising costs   are generally   deductible under Section 162).  104 See generally   Reg. § 1.263(a)—4, —5.  105 171   B.R.   603   (S.D.Ohio 1994).  106 105 T.C.   166  (1995).  pO   daar   200)  ws   _A.E.

CHAPTER   8   TAXABLE   CORPORATE   ACQUISITIONS  It concluded   that   most   of the   expenses   incurred   by the   taxpayer   in A.E. Staley were   related   to the defense   of its business   and   corporate   policy and thus   were   currently   deductible   under   Section   162(a).   Costs   properly  allocable   to unsuccessful   efforts   to engage   in an   alternate   transaction   to prevent   the   acquisition,   such   as   a   financial   restructuring,  recapitalization,   or joint venture,   were   held   to be deductible   losses   under  Section   165.   The   court   also   held   that   fees   paid to evaluate   the   taxpayer’s stock   and   to   facilitate   the   eventual   merger   were   nondeductible   capital expenditures. If   either   P   or   T   incurs   costs   in   investigating   or   attempting   to consummate   an   acquisition   that   ultimately   fails, the   transactional   costs generally   are   currently   deductible   as   losses   under   Section   165.109 The   Service   has   issued   lengthy   regulations   under   Section   263 relating   to the   tax   treatment   of amounts   incurred   to acquire,   create,   or  enhance   various   kinds   of intangible   assets.11°   The   regulations   specify,   in  extraordinary   detail,   various   categories   of rights,   privileges   and   future benefits   for which   capital   expenditure   treatment   is required.   Particular  goals   of this   regulations   project   were   to   bring   greater   clarity   to   (some  would   say   “erode”   or   “discard”)   the   “significant   future   benefit”   standard enunciated   by the   Supreme   Court   in Indopco,   Inc.   v.   Commissioner,   and to   resurrect   the   more   taxpayer-friendly   “separate   and   distinct   asset” approach   of the   Court’s   earlier   Lincoln   Savings   decision.   The   effect   of this   new   liberalized   regime   is   to   presume   that   outlays   related   to intangible   assets   are   currently   deductible   unless   these   or   subsequently issued   regulations   specifically   require   capitalization. The regulations include specific rules   on   an acquisition of a trade or  business, a change in the   capital structure of a business entity, and  certain   other transactions   such as Section   351 exchanges.!!!   Costs that  “facilitate” such   transactions must be capitalized.112 This standard is  consistent   with the previously   discussed case law on the purchaser’s acquisition   expenses. Transaction costs incurred to defend   against a  hostile takeover are not viewed as facilitating  the  acquisition. As a result,  they may be   currently deducted rather than capitalized.143 This rule  follows   the Seventh Circuit’s decision in A.E. Staley. If an initially  hostile  acquisition becomes friendly,   the taxpayer   must bifurcate   the costs  between those   incurred to defend   against the   hostile takeover   and those  incurred to facilitate the   friendly   acquisition, using a “facts and circumstances”   standard to draw the line.114 Costs   incurred to thwart a  hostile   acquisition,   such as by   merging with a White   Knight,   must be  109   Rey.

CHAPTER   9  ACQUISITIVE  REORGANIZATIONS  A.   INTRODUCTION  1.   HISTORICAL   BACKGROUND  Some   of the   major   litigation   arising   under   the   early   federal   income tax laws   involved   a variety   of transactions   loosely   described   as corporate  reorganizations.   Long   before   they   became   distracted   by   tax considerations,   corporate   lawyers   and   investment   bankers   were   busy devising   transactions   ranging   from   complicated   mergers,   acquisitions and   recapitalizations   to   routine   changes   in   the   state   of incorporation.  With   the   arrival   of the income   tax, the courts   were   required   to determine  whether   and   to what   extent   these   fundamental   changes   in the   structure of a corporate   entity   were   taxable   events. Working   with   a pristine   statute   and   an   unsophisticated   perspective,  the   Supreme   Court   became   one   of   the   first   protectors   of   the  comprehensive   tax   base.   In   a   series   of cases,   the   Court   concluded   that  even   minor   changes   in the   form   of a corporate   business   enterprise   (e.g.,  changing   the state   of incorporation   from   New   Jersey   to Delaware)   caused  the   shareholders   to   realize   gain.!   While   these   cases   were   pending, however,   Congress   quickly   came   to   the   rescue   by   enacting   one   of the  earliest   nonrecognition   provisions.   Preceding   even   the   forerunner   of Section   351,   Section   202(b)   of the   Revenue   Act   of 1918   provided   that   no gain   or   loss   would   be   recognized   on   the   “reorganization,   merger   or  consolidation   of a corporation”   where   a person   received   “in place   of stock  or securities   owned   by him   new   stock or securities   of no   greater   aggregate  par   face value.”?  The rationale for the reorganization provisions reflects the broader  policies   of nonrecognition.   Congress   concluded that   the   tax   collector should not impede these   diverse   transactions   because   they are mere readjustments of a continuing interest in property, albeit   in modified corporate   form,? and the new   property   received is “substantially a 1 Marr v.

390  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  continuation   of the   old investment   still unliquidated.”4   But   to the   extent that   a shareholder   liquidates   a corporate   investment,   recognition   of   gain  or loss   is appropriate.   The   1921   predecessor   of the   present   reorganization  regime   thus   provided   that   shareholders   must   recognize   their   realized  gain,   if any,   to   the   extent   of   the   “boot”   (money   and   other   property)  received.®   Congress   soon   refined   the   statutory   scheme   by   making   clear  what   it had   suggested   in   earlier   versions:   nonrecognition   really   means  deferral   rather   than   total   forgiveness   of gain or loss.   The   Revenue   Act   of 1928   introduced   rules   for   carryover   and   substituted   bases   in   order   to preserve   the   unrecognized   gain   or   loss   for   recognition   at   the   time   that the   shareholder   liquidated   his investment.§ What   began   as   a   relatively   simple   concept   has   evolved   into   a vast and   challenging   body   of law   that   governs   some   of the   most   financially significant   transactions   in   the   business   world.   It   is   important   to  recognize   at   the   outset   that   the   system   you   are   about   to   study   is   not necessarily   sensible.   Functionally   different   transactions   are   lumped together   and   labelled   “reorganizations.”   At   the   same   time,   economically equivalent   acquisition   methods   are   tested   for   reorganization   status  under   sharply   different   criteria   that   often   place   a great   premium   on   the form   chosen   by the parties.   Moreover,   determining   the   tax   consequences  of a   corporate   combination   or   readjustment   requires   an   application   of  both   precise   statutory   provisions   and   judicially   created   “common   law” principles   of   uncertain   scope.   Analysis   is   further   complicated   by   the possibility   of an   overlap   between   the reorganization   provisions   and   other parts   of Subchapter   C. In view of these defects in the reorganization   scheme, it is not surprising that commentators long ago called for a complete   overhaul of the current   system.7 Some modest reforms   have   come   from the Service through regulations and rulings   that   ease   the path to qualifying as a tax- free acquisition. Those pronouncements   harmonize some of the  requirements of Section   368 and in so doing   increase flexibility in  structuring tax-free   acquisitions. But   Congress has not   yet fully  embraced the simplification movement, and so we must turn to a more detailed examination of provisions that Professors   Bittker and Eustice  have   described as “extraordinarily   complex,   even for the   [Internal  Revenue] Code.”8  Reg. § 1.1002-1(c).

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  2.   OVERVIEW   OF   REORGANIZATIONS  Code:   Skim   §§ 336(c);   8354-356;   358;   361;   362(b);   368(a)(1),   (b), (c); 381(a);  1032.  Regulations:   § 1.868—1(a)-(c).  The   term   “reorganization”   generally   is   associated   with   the  rehabilitation   of   a bankrupt   company.   Under   the Internal   Revenue   Code, however,   “reorganization”   is   a   term   of art?   used   to   describe   corporate  combinations   or   readjustments   that   fall   into   the   following   three   broad  categories:  (1)   Acquisitive   reorganizations,   which   are   considered   in   this  chapter,   are   transactions   in   which   one   corporation   (the “acquiring   corporation”)   acquires   the   assets   or   stock   of  another   corporation   (the “acquired”   or “target”   corporation).  Included   in   this   category   are   statutory   mergers   or  consolidations   (“A” reorganizations);   acquisitions   of stock   of the   target   for voting   stock   of the   acquiring   corporation   (“B”  reorganizations);   acquisitions   of   assets   of   the   target   for voting   stock   of   the   acquiring   corporation   (“C” reorganizations,   sometimes   called   “practical   mergers” because   of   their   similarity   to   statutory   mergers);   and  several   other   more   complex   acquisition   techniques  involving   the use   of a subsidiary   or   multiple   steps.  (2)   Divisive   reorganizations,   which   result   in the   division   of a  single   corporation   into   two   or   more   separate   entities   and  which   often   are   preceded   by   a   “D”   reorganization.  Corporate   divisions   are   considered   in Chapter   10. (3) Nonacquisitive,   nondivisive   reorganizations, which involve  adjustments to the corporate   structure of a single,  continuing corporate enterprise.   This   residual   category  includes   recapitalizations (“E” reorganizations); changes in identity, form or place of incorporation § (“F”  reorganizations); certain   transfers of substantially all of  the assets from one corporation to another,   followed by a  liquidation of the first corporation   (nondivisive   sD®  reorganizations);   and transfers of a corporation’s assets to  another   corporation pursuant to a _ bankruptcy reorganization   plan (“G”   reorganizations).   These  transactions are considered in Chapter 11. A   common organizational   thread   weaves its way   through these diverse   categories. First, definitional   provisions set   forth requirements ranging   from   the   general   and   very flexible   test   to qualify as a Type   A  reorganization to the complex criteria imposed   by   Section   355 for  corporate   divisions.   To   qualify as   a reorganization, a transaction   also  9 See   LR.C.   §  368(a)(1);   Reg.   §  1.368-1(¢).  391

392  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  must pass muster under “common law”   doctrines developed by the courts  to reinforce the rationale for nonrecognition. The principal   judicial  doctrines affecting acquisitive reorganizations are continuity of  shareholder proprietary interest, continuity of business enterprise and  business purpose. In general, the continuity of interest doctrine requires that a substantial part of the value of the proprietary (i.e., equity)  interests in the target corporation must be preserved in the reorganization through an exchange of target stock or assets for stock in the acquiring corporation.!° For some transactions, the continuity of  interest doctrine has been   incorporated into the statutory definition of “reorganization.”   For example, the only permissible   consideration in a B  reorganization is voting stock of the acquiring corporation.!! The doctrine assumes far more importance if the statute is imprecise, as with Type A reorganizations, where the Code   merely requires a “statutory merger or consolidation” without   any   elaboration on the _ permissible consideration.!2 We therefore examine continuity of interest questions primarily in connection with Type A reorganizations—the context in which that doctrine most   frequently arises. The continuity of business enterprise doctrine, as its name implies, focuses on the continuing   business   operations of the target. This requirement has been   incorporated in the regulations!3 and also is considered   with “A” reorganizations. Because the business purpose doctrine was first applied and has the greatest importance in the context of a corporate division, it is discussed in Chapter 10. In general, all these requirements   must be satisfied   in order for a transaction to qualify as an acquisitive reorganization.!4 To further complicate matters, the Service  sometimes applies   the   step transaction doctrine to corporate reorganizations to convert what in form may be separate nontaxable  steps into what in substance is a taxable   transaction, or vice versa.15  If all these   statutory and judicial requirements are met, they  unlock the   doors to the “operative provisions”—sections of the Code that provide  for nonrecognition of gain or loss and that govern collateral matters   such  as the treatment of liabilities, basis, holding   period and   carryover of tax  attributes.16 For example, Sections   354 and   356   grant total or partial  nonrecognition of gain to the shareholders of the  target corporation in an acquisitive reorganization.   Section 358, which we encountered earlier   in  connection   with tax-free incorporations,   provides a formula for  determining the substituted basis   of  the   stock or securities received by these shareholders in a reorganization.

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS 361(a)   generally   provides   for   nonrecognition   when   a_   corporation  transfers   its   assets   in   a   reorganization   and   distributes   property   in   a liquidation   pursuant   to   a   reorganization   plan,!7   and   Section   357  generally   ensures   that   the   assumption   of the   target’s   liabilities   is not treated   as   boot   for this   purpose.   The   acquiring   corporation   is accorded  nonrecognition   under   Section   1032   with   respect   to   stock   used   to   make  the   acquisition   and   takes   a   transferred   basis   in   the   target’s   assets   or stock   under   Section   362(b).   In keeping   with   the continuity   of investment  principle,   the   tax   attributes   of the   target   corporation   (e.g., earnings   and profits   and   net   operating   losses)   generally   carry   over   to   the   acquiring  corporation   under   Section   381,   subject   to   various   limitations   to   patrol  abuse.18  If a transaction   does   not   qualify   as   a reorganization,   these   operative  provisions   do not   apply   and   the tax consequences   of the transaction   must  be determined   under   other   parts   of Subchapter   C. For   example,   an   asset  acquisition   that   fails as   a Type   A or C reorganization   ordinarily   would   be  a taxable   transaction   to the   shareholders   under   the   rules   considered   in  Chapters   7 and   8. But   it is the   rare   reorganization   that   fails.   Because   of  the high stakes   involved,   taxpayers   historically   were   reluctant   to proceed  with   reorganization   transactions   without   first   obtaining   the   Internal Revenue   Service’s   blessing in the form   of an   advance   ruling or, when   time  was   of the   essence,   a   reliable   opinion   letter   from   private   counsel.   Over  time,   the   Service   has   scaled   back   its   practice   of   providing   “comfort  rulings”   in advance   of a transaction   to assure   favorable   tax consequences.  It now   declines   to issue   a ruling   on   whether a transaction   constitutes   a  reorganization,!9   but   the   Service   will   rule   on   one   or   more   “significant”  issues   regarding   a proposed   reorganization,   as   distinguished   from   ruling  on   the   transaction   as   a whole.29   An   issue   is “significant”   if it is “an   issue  of law   the   resolution   of which   is not   essentially   free   from   doubt   and   that  is germane   to determining   the tax consequences   of the transaction.”*1   As a result   of the Service’s   limited   willingness   to issue   rulings   approving   the  tax-free   status   of reorganizations,   its administrative   guidelines   on   these  issues   often   are   tantamount   to the   law   in the   area,   and   taxpayers   who  disagree   with   the   government’s   viewpoint   must   proceed   with   a  transaction   at their   substantial   risk.  Finally, as we move to an examination of the reorganization “alphabet,” it will be helpful to use shorthand   terminology to identify the cast   of familiar   characters first encountered in connection   with   taxable  acquisitions. Once again, we will  refer to the acquiring   corporation as “P”  and the  target   corporation as  “T.”  17   See   also   I.R.C.   § 336(c).  18   See   Chapter   12, infra.  19 Rev.

The   Type   A   reorganization   is defined   in the   Code   as   a statutory   merger   or consolidation.   For   this   purpose,   “statutory”   refers   to  a   merger   or   consolidation   pursuant   to   local   (usually   corporate)   law.22  Under   a   typical   state   merger   statute,   the   assets   and   liabilities   of the  target   corporation   are   transferred   to   the   acquiring   corporation   without  the   need   for deeds   or   bills   of sale,   and   the   target   dissolves   by operation of   law.28   The   consideration   received   by   the   target’s   shareholders   is specified   in a formal   agreement   of merger   between   the   two   companies.  The   shareholders   may   receive   stock   or debt   instruments   of the   acquiring  corporation,   cash   or   a combination   of all three.   A   consolidation   involves a   similar   transfer   of the   assets   and   liabilities   of two   corporations   to   a newly   created   entity   followed   by   the   dissolution   of   the   transferor corporations,   and   the   shareholders   of   the   transferors   become  shareholders   of the   new   entity   by   operation   of law.   Either   transaction  may   require   approval   by   a   simple   majority   or   two-thirds   vote   of   the shareholders   of   both   corporations,24   and   under   state   corporate   law dissenting   shareholders   may   be   granted   the   right   to   sell   their   target  stock   at a price   determined   in an   appraisal   proceeding.25  “Divisive” Mergers.   To qualify as   a Type A reorganization, a merger must be an acquisitive   rather than a divisive transaction. To be “acquisitive,”   the   result   of the transaction must be   that   one corporation  acquires the   assets of another (target) corporation by operation of law,  22 Russell v. Commissioner, 40   T.C. 810 (1963),   affd, 345   F.2d   534 (5th   Cir.1965). The  regulations   provide that a transaction may qualify as a “statutory” merger or consolidation without   requiring it to be  effected under a domestic statute, thus permitting foreign corporations  to be parties to a Type   A reorganization.   Reg. § 1.368—2(b)(iii) Examples 13 & 14. 28 See, e.g., Cal. Corp. Code § 1107.  24 Id. As a general rule, most state corporate   laws give voting   rights to shareholders of  the purchasing (“P”) and target (“T”) corporations. But where the amount of P stock used in  the acquisition is less than 20 percent of its outstanding shares, P shareholders   usually   do  not have  the   right to vote. In   an acquisition   initiated by a tender offer, there is no formal   shareholder  vote because   T  shareholders   individually may decide whether or not to sell. Some states, such  as Delaware, also do   not   give P   shareholders the   right to vote   on   asset acquisitions not structured. as a merger,   triangular   mergers   where a P  subsidiary makes the   acquisition,   stock acquisitions, or certain   acquisitions for cash or cash   equivalents.   See generally   Oesterle &   Haas Mergers and   Acquisitions in a Nutshell   (3d ed. 2019); Bainbridge   &   Anabtawi   Mergers   and Acquisitions: A  Transactional   Perspective   (2017). 25 Under   Delaware law,  for example,   dissenting   target  shareholders   havea ; raisal  rights in statutory   mergers   but   not in asset   acquisitions.   8  Del.

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS 395  and   the   target   must   cease   to   exist.   By   contrast,   a “divisive”   transaction  is one   in   which   a   corporation’s   assets   are   divided   among   two   or   more corporations.   In   Revenue   Ruling   2000—5,26   the   Service   relied   on   this distinction   in ruling   that   a transaction   in which   T “merged”   under   state law   into   P,   transferring   only   some   of its   assets   and   liabilities,   and   T remained   in   existence,   was   not   a   Type   A   reorganization.27   Similarly,   a  transaction   where   T transferred   some   of its assets   and   liabilities   to each  of   two   acquiring   corporations   and   then   T   dissolved,   with   each   T  shareholder   receiving   stock   in   both   acquiring   corporations,   was   not   a  Type   A reorganization   even   though   it was   a merger   under   state   corporate law.28   Although   both   transactions   were   called   “mergers”   under   state   law, they   were   divisive   rather   than   acquisitive   because   T’s   assets   were  divided   between   two   corporations,   and   T’s   shareholders   wound   up   with stock   in two   separate   companies.?9  Revenue   Ruling   2000-5   was   the   Service’s   response   to a new   form   of  corporate   merger   statute   enacted   by   the   Texas   legislature   to   permit  divisive   mergers.29   The   understandable   concern   was   that   permitting  such   mergers   to qualify   as   Type   A reorganizations   would   be inconsistent with   the policy of Section   368   and   undermine   Section   355, which   imposes  strict and   detailed   requirements   for corporate   divisions   to qualify for tax-  free treatment.3!   The   ruling   serves   as a reminder   that   simple   compliance  with   a state   corporate   merger   law   does   not   ensure   that   a transaction   will  qualify   as   a Type   A reorganization.  Mergers   Involving   Disregarded   Entities.   In   a   similar   response   to  emerging   acquisition   techniques,   the   Service   issued   regulations  addressing   mergers   between   corporations   and   disregarded   entities   (such as   a single-member   limited   liability   company).3?   The   regulations   take   a common   sense   approach   to the   two   most   typical   transactional   forms:   (1) the   merger   of a single-member   limited   liability   company   (“LLC”)   with   a corporate   owner   (“X”)   into   an   acquiring   corporation   (“P”),   and   (2) the merger   of   a   target   corporation   (“IT”)   into   a   single-member   LLC   in exchange   for stock   of LLC’s   corporate   owner   (“P”). In both   situations,   the  LLC   is a   disregarded   entity   and   thus   is treated   for   tax   purposes   as   a division   of its corporate   owner   unless   it elects   to be taxed   as   a separate corporation.   The   first   transaction   does   not   qualify   as   a   Type   A reorganization   because   X’s   assets   and   liabilities   are   divided   between   X  26   9000-1   C.B.   436   (Situation   1).  27 Id.

Rul. 2000-5,   2000-1 C.B. 436   (Situation 2).  29 Some divisive transactions also may be  tax-free   but  they  must satisfy  the requirements  of Section 355. See Chapter 10,  infra.  30 For an   analysis   and critique   of Revenue   Ruling   2000-5, see Bank,   “Taxing Divisive   and  Disregarded   Mergers,”   34 Geo. L.

Certain   real   estate   investment   trusts   and   S   corporation   subsidiaries   also may   be  treated   as   disregarded   entities   for  tax   purposes.

It is as   if T  merged   directly   into   P.   Permitting   statutory   mergers   into   disregarded  entities   to   qualify   as   Type   A   reorganizations   offers   more   flexibility   by eliminating   the   need   for   these   transactions   to   pass   muster   under   the stricter   requirements   applicable   to   Type   CC__ stock-for-assets  acquisitions.35  Shareholder   and   Business   Enterprise   Continuity   Requirements.   The Code   is strangely   silent   as   to the   permissible   consideration   in a Type   A reorganization   and   the   degree   to   which   the   target’s   historic   business must   be   conducted   by the   acquiring   corporation.   To   fill these   gaps   and preserve   the integrity of the nonrecognition   scheme,   the courts   developed the   continuity   of   proprietary   interest   and   continuity   of   business enterprise   requirements.?6   Both   doctrines   are   examined   in the   materials  that follow.  b.

Commissioner  United States Court of Appeals, Fifth   Circuit, 1951. 189 F.2d 332.  m= RUSSELL,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE. The correctness of asserted deficiencies for corporate income tax for  the  year   1941 and of declared   value excess profits   tax and excess profits tax for 1942   due by   Southwest Natural   Gas Company depends   upon  whether a merger of Peoples Gas & Fuel Corporation with the taxpayer,  effected in accordance with the laws of Delaware,   was a sale, as asserted  by the Commissioner, or   a “reorganization”   within the terms of Section  112(g) [the predecessor of Section   368] of the Internal Revenue Code, as  contended   by the taxpayer. The parties so stipulated   the issue in the Tax Court. That   Court   upheld the Commissioner’s   determination. Southwest Natural   Gas Company has   petitioned this Court for review.

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  with   the provisions   of a state   law   authorizing   a merger   would   not in itself effect   a   “reorganization”   within   the   terms   applicable   under   Internal Revenue   Statutes;   that the test of continuity   of interest   was   nevertheless applicable;   and   that   the   transaction   in question   did   not   meet   this   test. This   ruling   is assigned   as   error   upon   grounds   which,   while   variously  stated,   require   for their   maintenance   establishment   of at least   one   of the  propositions   that:   if the   literal   language   of the   statute   is complied   with, that   is if there   is a “statutory   merger”   duly   effected   in accordance   with  state   law,   the   statute   requires   it be   treated   as   a   reorganization;   or,   at  least   where   such   merger   has   been   effected   the   Tax   Court   must   hold   the  transaction   a reorganization   in the   absence   of a finding   that   it was   not in  truth   and   in substance   a merger;   or,   even   if this   be   not   correct,   that   the  facts   of this   case   disclose   sufficient   “continuity   of interest.”   It 1s insisted  in either   view   the   Tax   Court   was   required   to hold   under   the   facts   found  by it that   the   transaction   in question   was   in truth   a “statutory   merger”  and   hence   a “reorganization.” Consideration   of   the   underlying   purposes   of   the   terms   and provisions   of Section   112   of the Internal   Revenue   Code   in its entirety   and  of this   Section   (g)(1)(A)   as   involved   here,   in particular,   as   being   enacted  “to   free   from   the   imposition   of an   income   tax   purely   ‘paper   profits   or losses’ wherein   there   is no   realization   of gain or loss in the business   sense but   merely   the recasting   of the same   interests   in a different   form,   the tax being   postponed   to   a   future   date   when   a   more   tangible   gain   or   loss   is  realized.”   Commissioner   of Internal   Revenue   v.   Gilmore’s   Estate,   3 Cir.,  130   F.2d   791,   794,   and   thus   applicable   to transactions   which   effect   only the   “readjustment   of   continuing   interest   in   property   under   modified  corporate   forms,”   clearly   discloses,   we   think,   that   the   accomplishment   of  a   statutory   merger   does   not   ipso   facto   constitute   a   “reorganization”  within   the   terms   of the   statute   here   involved.   This   has   been   expressly held   by the   Court   of Appeals   for the   Third   Circuit   in a well   considered  opinion,   supported   by   numerous   authorities   cited.   Roebling   v.  Commissioner,   143   F.2d   810.   There   is   no   occasion   for   elaboration   or  reiteration   of the   reasoning   and   authorities   set forth   in that   opinion.   In  Bazley   v.   Commissioner,   331   U.S.   737,   67   S.Ct.   1489,   1491,   91   L.Ed.  1782,   the   Supreme   Court   enforced   a similar   construction   with   reference  to   the   “re-capitalization”   provision   of the   section.   The   authorities   are clearly   to the   effect   that   the   terms   expressed   in the   statute   are   not   to be given   merely a literal interpretation   but are   to be considered   and   applied in accordance   with   the   purpose   of Section   112.   Thus   the   benefits   of the reorganization provision   have   been   withheld “in situations which   might have satisfied provisions of  the section   treated as inert language,   because they were not reorganizations of  the  kind with   which   § 112, in its purpose  and   particulars   concerns itself. *  * *”  It is thus   clear  that the  test  of  “continuity   of interest” announced   and applied   by  these   cited   authorities,   supra,   must   be  met   before a statutory merger   may   properly be held a reorganization   within   the  terms   of  Section  397

While no precise formula has been expressed for determining whether there has been retention of the requisite   interest,  it seems clear that   the requirement of continuity of interest consistent  with the statutory intent is not fulfilled in the absence of a showing: (1) that   the transferor corporation or  its shareholders retained a substantial  proprietary stake in the enterprise represented by a material interest in  the affairs   of the transferee   corporation,   and, (2) that such   retained interest represents a substantial part of the value of the property  transferred.  Among   other   facts,   the   Tax   Court   found   that   under   the   merger   all of  Peoples’   assets   were   acquired   by the   petitioner   in exchange   for specified amounts   of stock,   bonds,   cash   and   the   assumption   of debts.   There   was   a  total   of 18,875   shares   common   stock   of Peoples’   entitled   to   participate under   the   agreement   of merger.   The   stockholders   were   offered   Option   A and   Option   B. The   holders   of 7,690   of such   shares   exercised   Option   B of that   agreement   and   received   $30.00   in cash   for each   share,   or   a total   of  $230,700.00.   In respect   to the   stock   now   involved,   the   stockholders   who  exercised   Option   A,   the   holders   of   59.2   percent   of   the   common   stock  received   in   exchange   16.4   per   cent   of petitioner’s   outstanding   common  stock   plus   $340,350.00   principal   amount   of six per   cent   mortgage   bonds  (of the   market   value   of 90 per   cent   of principal),   which   had   been   assumed  by petitioner   ina   prior   merger   and   $17,779.59   cash.   The   16.4   per   cent   of  the common   stock   referred   to was   represented   by 111,850   shares   having  a market   value   of $5,592.50,   or five cents   per   share,   and   represented   the  continuing   proprietary   interest   of the   participating   stockholders   in   the  enterprise.   This   was   less   than   one   per   cent   of the   consideration   paid   by  the   taxpayers.  We think it clear that these and other facts found by the Tax   Court find substantial   support in the evidence, and the conclusion of the Tax  Court that they failed to evidence sufficient continuity of interest to bring  the transaction   within the requirements of the applicable   statute is  correct.  The decision of the Tax   Court is affirmed.  [The   dissenting   opinion of Chief Judge   Hutcheson has   been omitted.  Ed.]  Revenue   Ruling   66-224  1966—2   Cum.   Bull.   114.  Corporation X was merged   under state law into corporation Y.  Corporation X had four stockholders (A, B,  C, D),  each of whom   owned 25 percent of its stock. Corporation   Y  paid A  and   B each   $50,000 in  cash for  their   stock   of corporation   X,   and   C   and   D each   received   corporation   Y stock   with a value   of $50,000   in exchange for   their   stock   of  corporation X.

Held,   the   continuity   of interest   requirement   of section   1.368—1(b)   of the   regulations   has   been   satisfied.   It would   also   be   satisfied   if the   facts  were   the   same   except   corporation   Y paid   each   stockholder   $25,000   in  cash   and   each   stockholder   received   corporation   Y stock   with   a value   of  $25,000.  NOTE  Measuring   Continuity   of Interest.   The   continuity   of interest   doctrine historically   required   the   shareholders   of the   target   corporation   to receive   a sufficient   proprietary   interest   in the acquiring   corporation   to justify treating  the   transaction   as   a wholly   or   partially   tax-free   reorganization   rather   than  a   taxable   sale.37   The   early   cases   focused   on   both   the   quality   of   the consideration   received   by   the   target’s   shareholders   and   the   percentage   of equity   consideration   (relative   to   total   consideration)   received   by   those  shareholders   as   a group.   For   example,   in one   of the   first cases   to apply   the doctrine,   the   Supreme   Court   held   that   a transaction   literally   satisfying   the definition   of a reorganization   nonetheless   was   a taxable   sale   because   the   T  shareholders   received   only   short-term   notes   of the   acquiring   corporation.*® In a later   case,   the   Court   held   that there   was   sufficient   continuity   of interest where   the   T shareholders   received   38   percent   nonvoting   preferred   stock   of the   acquiring   corporation   and   62 percent   cash.%?  In evaluating   continuity   of interest,   it is the overall continuity   preserved in   the   transaction   that   controls,   not   the   continuity   of   any   individual  shareholder.*®   All classes   of stock,   whether   voting   or nonvoting,   provide   the  requisite   continuity   while   any   other   consideration   (cash,   short-term   notes, bonds,   assumption   of liabilities)   will   fail   to   meet   the   test.41   The   lines   with  respect   to   the   percentage   of stock   that   must   be   received   are   not   so   easily  drawn   if one   refers   to the   case   law.42   The   Service   once   provided a practical benchmark   by   declaring   that   it   would   rule   favorably   on   a   Type   A reorganization   if P uses   at least   50   percent   equity   consideration   in making the   acquisition.43   An   example   now   in the   regulations   confirms   the   Service’s more   permissive   newer   view   that   40   percent   continuity   is sufficient44—a  position   long   advocated   by experienced   tax   advisers   and   supported   by case  37 See   generally   Bittker & Eustice, supra note 8, 12.21. 38 Pinellas Ice & Cold   Storage Co. v.

400  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  law.45 Keep in mind that this “percentage” is the proportion of equity  consideration relative to total consideration   used by P to acquire T,  not the  percentage of P stock owned by former T shareholders after the P’s  acquisition of T. Moreover, overall qualification as a reorganization under  this liberal standard does not mean that all T shareholders will be able to defer recognition of  their   gain. Those receiving nonequity consideration must recognize gain, if any, perhaps as ordinary   income, to the extent they receive  boot.46 But if the   entire transaction fails to qualify as a reorganization, all  the parties (including T), not merely those receiving nonequity consideration, must recognize   gain or loss.  These   venerable   principles   are   not   altered   by   Section   356(e),   which  treats   certain   debt-like   preferred   stock,   defined   in   Section   351(g)   as “nonqualified   preferred   stock,”   as   other   property   (i.e. boot)   for   purposes   of  recognition   of gain   or   loss   by   the   T   shareholders   in   a   reorganization.   In  treating   nonqualified   preferred   stock   as   boot   for   gain   recognition   purposes,  Congress   was   responding   to concerns   about   acquisitive   transactions   in which  T   shareholders   received   a   relatively   secure   instrument   labelled   as   “stock”  but   bearing   many   of the   characteristics   of debt   in   exchange   for   a   riskier equity   investment.   In   those   circumstances,   Congress   believed   it   was appropriate   to   view   the   new   debt-like   preferred   stock   as   taxable  consideration   because   the   T shareholder   was   obtaining   a   more   secure   form  of   investment.   Congress   indicated,   however,   that   nonqualified   preferred stock   would   continue   to be   treated   as   equity   under   other   provisions   of the Code,   such   as   Sections   351   and   368,   at   least   until   prospective   regulations provide   otherwise.47 Remote Continuity. The continuity of interest test was once interpreted as requiring the T stock or assets acquired in a reorganization to be   held  directly by the corporation that   issues its stock to T shareholders.48   This  “remote continuity”   doctrine focused on the  requisite link between the former T shareholders   and the T business assets after the reorganization. Subsequent amendments to the Code   provided   more flexibility—for example, by   permitting “drop-down” transfers to subsidiaries of the acquiring corporation’? or allowing a controlled subsidiary to use its parent’s   stock as consideration in a merger.59 The regulations go further by   permitting successive   transfers of T stock or assets among various members of an  affiliated group of corporations or, in some cases, to a controlled partnership.®! In general,   these regulations   provide that continuity is not  broken   by a transfer or successive   transfers of the acquired T stock or assets  to lower-tier   subsidiaries provided that   the   transferor   continues to “control”  © See   generally Ginsburg,   Levin & Rocap,   Mergers,   Acquisitions   and Buyouts J 610.2  (April  2018). ;  46 See   Section C1 of  this chapter, infra.  47 Staff of  the   Joint Committee on Taxation,   General   Explanation of Tax   Legislation Enacted in 1997,   105th   Cong., 1st Sess. 212-213 (1997).

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS 401  (using   the   80   percent   tests   in   Section   368(c))   each   transferees?   and   the  continuity   of business   enterprise   requirement   is satisfied.53 When   to   Measure   Continuity   of Interest.   In   determining   whether   the  requisite   proprietary   interest   in the   target   corporation   has   been   preserved  for   continuity   of interest   purposes   in   a   potential   reorganization   where   the  merger   agreement   provides   for   “fixed”   consideration,”   the   regulations provide   that   the   appropriate   measuring   date   is the   last business   day before  the first date   that   the contract   is a “binding   contract.”54   This   is known   as the  “signing   date   rule.”   A “binding   contract”   is an   instrument   enforceable   under  applicable   law   against   the   parties   to it.55 The   presence   of conditions   outside the parties’   control   (such   as the need   for regulatory   approval)   or the fact that insubstantial   terms   remain   to   be   negotiated   or   customary   conditions satisfied   will not   prevent   a contract   from   being   “binding.”5*   Consideration   is  “fixed”   if the contract   recites   the number   of shares   of P stock   and   the amount  of   nonstock   consideration   to   be   received   by   T’s   shareholders,57   and   the  contract   does   not   include   contingent   adjustments   that   prevent   T’s  shareholders   from   being   subject   to   the   economic   benefits   and   burdens   of  ownership   of P as   of the   signing   date   (e.g., when   T shareholders   are   entitled  to receive   additional   consideration   if the price of P stock   declines   by specified  amounts   during   the   interval   between   the   signing   and   deal   closing   dates).  Without   this   pro-taxpayer   signing   date   rule,   a   decline   in   the   value   of the acquiring   corporation’s   stock   between   the   signing   date   and   the   date   the acquisition   is   consummated   could   cause   the   transaction   to   fall   below   the  continuity   threshold.   The   policy for the signing   date   rule is that, if a contract provides   for fixed   consideration,   the   T shareholders   are   properly   viewed   as  being   subject   to   the   “economic   fortunes”   of P   as   of the   date   the   contract becomes   binding.*&  If the   consideration   received   in a potential   reorganization   is not   fixed,  continuity   of interest   is measured   based   on   the value   of the P stock   as of “the  effective   date”   of the   transaction.5?   This   is known   as   the   “closing   date   rule.” Under   this approach,   a decline   in the value   of the P stock between   the signing and   closing   dates   could   cause   a transaction   to fail the   continuity   of interest  requirement.  In valuing stock for continuity of interest purposes in most   real-world transactions, the  parties usually prefer to hedge against market volatility by  using an average price   over a period of time   rather   than a closing   price   on a  single date. If either   the signing or closing   date rule   applies,   the   Service authorizes three safe harbor   valuation methods using average   trading prices  52   Reg.   § 1.368—2(k)(1). 53   Reg.   § 1.368—1(d)(4),   (5).  54 Reg. § 1.368-1(e)(2)(i). The regulations detail how continuity of  interest is measured if  the   deal terms are modified before   the   closing   date, how tender offers   are handled,   and how the rules   are applied when an agreement provides for shareholder elections, contingent  adjustments,   and   escrowed stock arrangements.

IDENTIFYING   THE   SHAREHOLDERS   WHO   MuST   MAINTAIN CONTINUITY   OF   INTEREST  Because   the   shareholders   of the   target   corporation   must   receive   a sufficient   amount   of   stock   of the   acquiring   corporation   to   satisfy   the continuity   of   interest   doctrine,   it   sometimes   is   necessary   to   identify which   target   shareholders   count   for purposes   of this requirement.   At one  time,   the   IRS’s   position   was   that   a substantial   part   of the   consideration  paid by the   acquiring   corporation   (“P”) must   consist   of P stock   paid to T’s  “historic”   shareholders—i.e.   shareholders   who   held   their   T   stock   before  P   commenced   its   efforts   to   acquire   control   of   T   in   a   reorganization.  Identifying   historic   shareholders   often   was   problematic,   however,   in  acquisitions   of   publicly   traded   companies   because   of   numerous   open market   transactions   that   occur   after   an   acquisition   is   announced   but before   it is finally consummated. For example, assume on January 1 that T is owned by 100  shareholders each of whom owns one percent of T stock. Two  corporations, P-1 and P-2, each wish to acquire T and each suitor makes  a tender offer to the T shareholders. By  March 1, P-1 purchases the   stock  of 30 T shareholders for cash   while P-2 purchases the   stock of 45 T  shareholders, also for cash. The ultimate winner is P-2, which on June 1  completes its acquisition by acquiring all the T stock it does not already own (55  percent, including P-1’s 30 shares and the  25 shares not tendered to either suitor) for P-2 common stock, and then T merges into   P-2. Does the merger of T into P-2   qualify as   a Type A reorganization? Recall   that a key qualification   issue is whether shareholders owning at least 40 percent of the T stock maintain sufficient continuity of interest by receiving   P-2 common stock in exchange for their T stock. If continuity is measured with   reference to T’s J anuary | shareholders (the “historic”  shareholders of  T), the acquisition fails the test because 75 percent of  those shareholders sold   their T stock for cash. But if the continuity of  interest test is based on the T   shareholders at the time of  P-2’s June 1  acquisition, then T   shareholders   holding 55 percent of T will have received   P-2 stock, and the test   will be   met.   In J. E. Seagram Corp. v.  Commissioner,®! the Tax   Court   considered similar facts and   declined to  measure continuity of  interest   solely by looking to the   “historic” (1.e., January 1) shareholders of  T. The court   held   that   continuity of interest was satisfied   on these facts, reasoning that   P-1 “stepped into   the   shoes”  60 Rev.   Proc. 2018-12,   2018-6   LR.B. 349.  $1 104  T.C.  75  (1995). Seagram was a “role reversal”   case   in which the  unsuccessful   bidder  (P-1 in  the example in  the   text) argued that   the   transaction   did not   qualify as   a reorganization  in order to deduct a   loss   on its exchange of T stock   for P stock. The   IRS   argued   that   the  transaction   qualified   as   a Type   A  reorganization.

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  of the   30 percent   T shareholder   group   who   sold their   stock   to P-1   for cash.  The   court   also   reasoned   that   focusing   on   the   “historic   shareholders”   of a publicly   traded   target   corporation   to   measure   continuity   would   require tracking   all the transactions   in T stock   once   an   acquisition   is announced and   be “completely   unrealistic.” The   Tax   Court’s   decision   in Seagram   represented   an   evolution   in the understanding   of the   historic   shareholder   concept.   The   IRS   ultimately adopted   the   court’s   reasoning,   and   the   regulations   now   eliminate   the relevance   of historic   T   shareholders   except   in   very   limited   situations. They   provide   that   a   “mere   disposition”   of T   stock   prior   to   a   potential  reorganization   to   buyers   unrelated   to   T   or   P   will   be   disregarded   in  applying   the   continuity   of interest   doctrine.®2 The   regulations   offer   tax   practitioners   some   interesting   planning  opportunities.   For example,   assume   T is owned   70 percent   by shareholder  A   and   30   percent   by shareholder   B, and   P wishes   to acquire   T in a tax-  free   merger.   At one   time,   it was   thought   that   P could   not   achieve   its goal  if A wished   to cash   out   of T. Under   the regulations,   however,   if A can   find  an   independent   third   party   purchaser   who   is willing   to buy   A’s   T stock for cash   and   who   eventually   becomes   a P shareholder   after   the   merger, each   of the   party’s   business   and   tax   objectives   may   be   satisfied   with  careful   planning.§3   A’s sale for cash,   of course,   is a taxable   event   to A, but  B   achieves   nonrecognition   of gain   on   the   exchange   of B’s   T   stock   for   P stock   in the merger,   and   T does   not   recognize   gain or loss on   the transfer  of its assets   to P.  The   regulations   guard   against   situations   where   a T shareholder   may  indirectly   receive   cash   compensation   from   P. In one   example,   shareholder  A   owns   100   percent   of T   and,   in   a   merger,   A   receives   P   stock   which   A sells   to B, an   unrelated   buyer.   If that   was   the   whole   story,   it would   be a happy   ending   because   the   continuity   of interest   requirement   would   be  satisfied.   The   fatal   flaw   in the   example   is that   shortly   thereafter,   and   in  connection   with the merger,   P redeems   B’s stock for cash.   The   regulations conclude   that   the   continuity   of interest   requirement   is not   satisfied   on  those   facts because,   in substance,   P acquired   the T stock   solely for cash.4  But   if T redeems   the   stock   of one   of its shareholders   for cash   prior to the  acquisition,   with   no   consideration   coming   from   P,   the   preacquisition  redemption   does   not   affect   continuity   of   interest,   which   in   this   fact  pattern   is   determined   solely   with   reference   to   the   remaining   T  shareholders.®  62   Reg.   § 1.368-1(e)(1)G).  63 See   Reg. § 1.368-1(e)(8) Example 1(ii).  64 Reg. § 1.368-1(e)(8) Example 5.  6   Reg.   § 1.368-2(e)(8)   Example   9.  403

404  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  d.   POST-ACQUISITION   CONTINUITY  Another   aspect   of the   continuity   of interest   doctrine   relates   to the  length   of time   that   the   target   shareholders   must   hold their   stock in   the  acquiring   corporation.   For   example,   assume   T merges   into   P in   a tax-free  reorganization   in   which   the   only   consideration   is   P   stock,   but  shareholders   who   hold   80 percent   of the   T stock   are   legally   committed   at  the   time   of the   merger   to   sell   their   P   stock   to   a   third   party.   Does   the prearranged   sale   disqualify   the   merger   as   a   Type   A   reorganization  because   the   continuity   of   interest   test   is   not   met.   The   selling   T shareholders   will be taxed   in either   event,   of course,   although   the timing of their   gain   may   be   affected   if the   merger   and   subsequent   stock   sale occur   in different   taxable   years,   but what   about   the 20 percent   who   retain their   P   stock?   And   what   are   the   appropriate   tax   consequences   to   the  target   and   acquiring   corporations?  The   Service   has   never   required   T’s   shareholders   to   maintain continuity   of interest   in   P   for   any   particular   period   of time   after   an acquisitive   reorganization.   But   in   determining   if   the   continuity   of interest   requirement   has   been   satisfied,   the   Service   for   many   years considered   sales   and   other   dispositions   of stock   occurring   subsequent   to a   merger   which   are   part   of   the   same   overall   “plan.”66   The   courts disagreed   over   whether   a pre-merger   intent   to sell (without   any   binding  commitment)   would   defeat   continuity   of interest.67  The regulations resolve   the   issue by providing that subsequent dispositions of P stock received in a potential reorganization by former T shareholders generally will be disregarded in determining   whether the continuity of shareholder interest requirement is met,   even if the  dispositions were pursuant to   a preexisting binding contract.§8 This is  consistent   with the   Service’s current   position   that   the continuity of interest requirement is satisfied if  a substantial part of the value of the  proprietary interest in T is preserved   through an exchange for a  proprietary interest (i.e., stock) of  P. But if the facts demonstrate that T shareholders   have sold their P stock for cash to P ora related party (e.g., a P subsidiary)   before or after the   acquisition,   the continuity of interest requirement may not be satisfied.69 For example, if P   reacquired stock that it issued in the reorganization   from T  shareholders in exchange for  cash,   the reacquisition would be considered in determining if the  continuity of interest requirement   was satisfied. But sales   of P stock by  \  6   Rev. Proc. 77-37,   supra note 43. 67 See, e.g., McDonald’s   Restaurants of Illinois,   Ine. v. Commissioner, 688   F.2d   520 (7th Cir.1982),   rev’g   76   T.C. 972 (1981), where the Tax   Court   treated a post-merger sale   of P stock  by   former   T   shareholders as   a separate   transaction   because the shareholders   were not  interest.

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS   405  former   T   shareholders   to   outsiders   would   be   ignored,   even   if the   sales  were   pursuant   to   a   binding   commitment   entered   into   prior   to   the  reorganization.7°  Revenue   Ruling   99-58,   which   follows,   is another   illustration   of the  Service’s   tolerance   toward   post-acquisition   continuity   issues.  Revenue   Ruling   99-58  1999-2   Cum.   Bull.   701.  ISSUE  What   is   the   effect   on   continuity   of   interest   when   a   potential  reorganization   is followed   by an   open   market   reacquisition   of P’s stock?  FACTS  T   merges   into   P,   a   corporation   whose   stock   is widely   held,   and   is publicly   and   actively   traded.   P has   one   class   of common   stock   authorized  and   outstanding.   In   the   merger,   T   shareholders   receive   50   percent common   stock of   P and   50 percent   cash.   Viewed   in isolation,   the exchange would   satisfy the continuity   of interest   requirement   of § 1.368—1(e)   of the  Income   Tax   Regulations.   However,   in   an   effort   to   prevent   dilution  resulting   from   the   issuance   of P   shares   in the   merger,   P’s   preexisting  stock   repurchase   program   is modified   to enable   P to reacquire   a number  of its   shares   equal   to   the   number   issued   in   the   acquisition   of T.   The  number   of shares   repurchased   will   not   exceed   the   total   number   of P  shares   issued   and   outstanding   prior to the   merger.   The   repurchases   are made   following   the   merger,   on   the open   market,   through a broker   for the prevailing   market   price.   P’s   intention   to   repurchase   shares   was  announced   prior   to the   T merger,   but   the   repurchase   program   was   not   a  matter   negotiated   with   T   or   the   T   shareholders.   There   was   not   an understanding   between   the   T   shareholders   and   P   that   the   T shareholders’   ownership   of P stock   would   be   transitory.   Because   of the  mechanics   of an   open   market   purchase,   P does   not   know   the identity   of a  seller   of P stock,   nor   does   a former   T shareholder   who   receives   P stock   in  the   merger   and   subsequently   sells   it   know   whether   P   is   the   buyer. Without   regard   to the repurchase   program,   a market   exists for the newly- issued   P   stock   held   by   the   former   T   shareholders.   During   the   time   P  undertakes   its repurchase   program,   there   are   sales   of P stock on the open  market,   which   may   include   sales   of P shares   by former   T shareholders.  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  - Requisite to  a reorganization   under the   Internal Revenue   Code is a continuity of  interest as described in § 1.368-1(e).   Section 1.368—-1(b).  The   general   purpose of  the   continuity of  interest requirement is   “to prevent   transactions   that   resemble sales from   qualifying for  nonrecognition of  gain or   loss   available to corporate   reorganizations.”  7   See   Reg.   §  1.368-1(e)(8)   Example (4)(i).

406  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Section   1.368—1(e)(1)(i).   To   achieve   this   purpose,   the   regulation   provides that   a proprietary   interest   in the   target   corporation   is not   preserved   to the   extent   that,   “in   connection   with   the   potential   reorganization,   ... stock   of the   issuing   corporation   furnished   in exchange   for   a proprietary interest   in   the   target   corporation   in   the   potential   reorganization   is  redeemed.”   Id.   However,   for purposes   of the   continuity   requirement,   “a  mere   disposition   of   stock   of   the   issuing   corporation   received   in   the  potential   reorganization   to   persons   not   related   ...   to   the   issuing corporation   is disregarded.”   Id. The   regulation   provides   that   all facts   and  circumstances   will   be   considered   in determining   whether,   in substance, a proprietary   interest   in the   target   corporation   is preserved. Under   the   facts   set   forth   above,   continuity   of interest   is satisfied.  There   was   not   an   understanding   between   the   T shareholders   and   P that the   T   shareholders’   ownership   of   the   P   shares   would   be   transitory.  Further,   because   of the   mechanics   of an   open   market   repurchase,   the  repurchase   program   does   not   favor   participation   by   the   former   T  shareholders.   Therefore,   even   if   it   could   be   established   that   P   has  repurchased   P   shares   from   former   T   shareholders   in   the   repurchase  program,   any   such   purchase   would   be coincidental.   The   merger   and   the stock   repurchase   together   in substance   would   not   resemble   a   sale   of T  stock   to P by the   former   T shareholders   and,   thus,   the   repurchase   would  not   be   treated   as   “in   connection   with”   the   merger.   Under   the   facts presented,   a sale of P stock   on the open   market   by a former   T shareholder  during   the repurchase   program   will have   the   same   effect   on   continuity   of  interest   as   a mere   disposition   to persons   not   related   to P.  HOLDING  Under the facts presented, the open market   repurchase of shares through a broker   has no effect on continuity of interest in the potential  reorganization.  e. RELATIONSHIP OF CONTINUITY OF INTEREST DOCTRINE TO TAXABLE   STOCK  ACQUISITIONS  The tax-free reorganization rules   often overlap   with   other   provisions  in Subchapter C. One potential   jurisdictional conflict is between the treatment of a “qualified   stock purchase” (e.g., P’s purchase of 80 percent  or more of T stock) as defined in Section   338   and an acquisitive  reorganization. The Service   has   issued   regulations   addressing the   tax  consequences of the   transfer of  T’s assets to P or   a P affiliate following  P’s qualified   stock purchase   where   P does   not make a Section   338 election.7! They provide   that   the T stock acquired   by P in  the   qualified  stock purchase will count for continuity of  interest purposes if T later transfers its assets to  a P  subsidiary (“S”), enabling   the  second   step  of  the transaction to qualify as   a tax-free   acquisitive   reorganization.72   As a  1 Reg. § 1.338-3(d)(1).   See   Chapter   8C2,   supra. 7   Reg.   §  1.338-3(d)(2)   Similarly, P is treated as   a T   shareh  ae ‘ older   for   purposes of determining   whether,   immediately after  the transfer   of T assets,   a T shareholder ie “control”

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS   407  result,   T does   not   recognize   gain   on   the   transfer   of its assets,   which   will take   a transferred   basis   in S’s hands.73  These   regulations   reverse   the   holding   in   Yoc   Heating   v.  Commissioner,74   a much   discussed   old Tax   Court   case   where   P bought   85  percent   of   T’s   stock   for   cash   and   notes   and,   as   part   of   the   same  transaction,   T subsequently   transferred   its assets   to S, a newly   formed   P subsidiary   and   then   dissolved.   P received   additional   S stock   in exchange  for its T stock,   and   the T minority   shareholders   received   cash   in exchange  for their   T stock.   The   Tax   Court   viewed   P’s purchase   of T stock   and   the subsequent   T asset   transfer   to S as   an   integrated   transaction   in which   P acquired   all of T’s   assets   for cash   and   notes.   Consequently,   it held   that  there   was   insufficient   continuity   of interest   to qualify   the   asset   transfer  as a Section   368 reorganization   because   the historic   shareholders   of T did not   receive   any   P stock.   The   upshot   was   that   S received   a cost   basis   in  the   T assets   rather   than   the   transferred   basis   it would   have   taken   if the  acquisition   had   qualified   as   a   reorganization.   Because   the   General  Utilities   doctrine   was   still   alive   at the   time   of this   transaction,   T did   not  recognize   any   corporate-level   gain   or   loss   as   a   result   of   the   court’s  decision. The   regulations   take   the   position   that   the   result   in   Yoc   Heating   is  inconsistent   with   the   policy   of   Section   338   to   preempt   the   subjective  Kimbell-Diamond   doctrine,   which   treated   P’s purchase   of T stock   for cash  followed   by a liquidation   of T as   a taxable   purchase   of T’s   assets.”5   The  regulations   also   provide   that   the   operative   reorganization   provisions applicable   to   shareholders   of the   target   corporation   in   an   acquisitive reorganization   do   not   apply   to   minority   shareholders   of T   unless   the transfer   of   T   assets   is   pursuant   to   a   reorganization   under   generally applicable   tax   rules   without   regard   to   the   regulations.76   To   illustrate,  assume   P buys   85   percent   of the   stock   of T for cash   from   shareholder   A  and   does   not   make   a Section   338   election.   The   remaining   15 percent   of T is owned   by Mrs.   K. Shortly   thereafter,   as part of the same   plan, T merges  into   S, a   100   percent   subsidiary   of P, and   Mrs.   K receives   P (or S) stock in   exchange   for   her   T   stock.   Under   the   regulations,   the   continuity   of  interest   requirement   is not   met   in determining   the   tax   consequences   to  Mrs.   K, who   thus   recognizes   gain   or   loss   with   respect   to the   exchange   of  her   T   stock.77   Why?   How   can   a   transaction   qualify   as   a   reorganization for some   purposes   (T’s transfer   of its assets)   but   not   for others   (Mrs.   K’s  exchange   of her T stock)?  of  the corporation to which the   assets are transferred for purposes of Section   368(a)(1)(D).   Reg.  § 1.338-3(d)(3).   See Chapter 11B, infra.  73 Reg. § 1.838-3(d)(5) Example (aii).  74 61   T.C.   168   (1978).  75 See   Chapter   8C1,   supra. 76 Reg.   §  1.338-3(d)(5)   Example (v). See   also Kass v. Commissioner,   60 T.C.   218   (1973). 77 Id.  See   also   Reg.   §  1.368—1(e)(8)   Example 4(i1).

408  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  f.   CONTINUITY   OF   BUSINESS   ENTERPRISE  Bentsen   v.   Phinney  United   States   District   Court,   Southern   District   of Texas,   1961.  199   F.Supp.   363.  a   GARZA,   DISTRICT   JUDGE.  [Rio Development   Company   was   a Texas   corporation   engaged   in the land   development   business   along   with   two   other   corporations.   All   three corporations   were   controlled   by   the   Bentsen   family.   The   three corporations   transferred   all their   assets,   subject   to liabilities,   to a newly formed   life   insurance   company.   The   transferor   corporations   then  liquidated,   and   their   shareholders   became   shareholders   of   the   new  insurance   company.   The   parties   stipulated   that   there   was   a   business purpose   for the   transaction. After   failing to obtain   an   advance   ruling   from   the   Service   that   their exchange   of stock   in   the   land   development   companies   for   stock   in   the  insurance   company   was   a tax-free   transaction,   the   taxpayers   reported   a  taxable   gain and   then   took the necessary   procedural   steps   to file a refund suit   in   federal   district   court.   The   taxpayers   contended   that   the transaction   qualified   as   a reorganization,   while   the   Service   argued   that it failed   to   meet   the   requirements   of Section   368   because   of a   lack   of continuity   of business   enterprise.   Ed.] The question for the Court to decide is: Was such   corporate transaction a corporate   “reorganization”, as the term   “reorganization” is  defined in Section 368(a)(1), Internal Revenue Code of 1954;   26 U.S; Cat  § 368(a)(1), even though Rio Development Company engaged in the land development business   and thereafter the new   Insurance Company engaged in the insurance   business?  The plaintiff taxpayers   contend there was a corporate  reorganization. The Government,   Defendant in   this cause, maintains  that   there was not a corporate   reorganization   under Section   368(a)(1) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, because there was not a continuity of  business   enterprise   before and after the reorganization;   and that this is  a prerequisite as   set out   in the Treasury Regulations. This case is governed   by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,   26 U.S.C.,   the  applicable   sections   of which provide [the quoted   excerpts   from Sections   368   and   354   have   been   omitted.   Ed.]  ** *  It is conceded that the   1939   Internal Revenue   Code   was the same in  this respect as the   1954   Code,   and   that   the corresponding   Treasury Regulations   issued   under the   1939   Code are similar to the corresponding  Treasury   Regulations   issued   under   the   1954   Code.

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  The   Treasury   Regulation   states:   “Requisite   to   a   reorganization under   the   Code,   are   a   continuity   of   business   enterprise   under   the  modified   corporate   form.” The   Government   contends   that   since   there   was a lack   of “continuity  of   the   business   enterprise”,   there   was   not   a   reorganization   as contemplated   under   the   statutes. The   question   for this   Court   to decide   is the meaning   of “continuity   of  business   enterprise”,   and   whether   or   not   it exists   in this   case.  The   Government   takes   the   position   that   “continuity   of business  enterprise”   means   that   the   new   corporation   must   engage   in   the   same  identical   or similar   business.   Stated   in another   manner,   the   Government  maintains   it is   necessary   that   there   must   be   an   identity   of   type   of business   before   and   after   the   reorganization.  The   plaintiff taxpayers   have   cited   to the   Court   the   case   of Becher   v. Commissioner,   221   F.2d   252   (2d Cir.1955)   affirming   22   T.C.   932   (1954),  which   the   Government   has   tried to distinguish.   In this case   the taxpayer owned   all the   stock   in a corporation   engaged   in the   sponge   rubber   and  canvass-product   manufacturing   business.   The   new   corporation   engaged  in the business   of manufacturing   upholstered   furniture.   In that   case,   the Government   took   the   position   that   there   had   been   a reorganization   and that   a cash   distribution   to   the   shareholders   of the   old   corporation   was taxable   as   “boot”   and   was   ordinary   income   to   the   shareholders.   The  Government   prevailed   in that   case,   and   the   Court,   at 221   F.2d   252,   253,  said: “*   * * but the Tax   Court   here   correctly held that a business  purpose   does   not require   an   identity of business   before   and   after  the reorganization.   * * *”  Other cases cited are Pebble   Springs Distilling Co. v. Commissioner,  231   F.2d   288 (7th   Cir.1956), cert. denied   352 U.S.   836,   77 S.Ct.   56,   1  L.Ed.2d 55 affirming 23 T.C. 196 (1954). There the old corporation had  the power to carry on both a whiskey distilling business   and a real  estate  business,   but it engaged solely  in the real   estate business.  Another case   cited to the Court is Morley   Cypress Trust v.  Commissioner, 3 T.C.   84   (1944).   In that   case   the   old corporation owned  land   held for timber   and the land   was   conveyed to   a new corporation engaged in  the oil business. The Government tries   to distinguish   these last two   cases by  saying that in  the Pebble   Springs Distilling   Co.   case   the new   corporation   could  engage in  the whiskey distilling business if  it had   wanted to, and that   in  the Morley   Cypress   Trust case,   after   the problem of continuity of business   enterprise   had   been   presented,   the   required   continuity   could have   been   found   because   both   the   old and   the new   corporations   were actively   engaged in  exploiting   the  natural   resources   of  the   same land.  409

410  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  The   Government   also   contends   that   under   Texas   law   an   insurance company   cannot   engage   in any   business   other   than   that   of insurance.  The   Morley   Cypress   Trust   case   cited   above,   this   Court   believes,   is  the case   most   like the case   before   the   Court.   In the Morley   Cypress   Trust  case   the   land   was   held   for   timber.   In   this   case   it   was   held   for  development.   In   the   Morley   case   land   was   conveyed   to   a   new   oil corporation   for use   in the   oil business.   In this   case,   land   (plus   proceeds from   the   sale   of land)   was   conveyed   to a new   corporation   to furnish   the  means   to capitalize   a new   insurance   business.  The   Government   contends   that   the   corresponding   Treasury Regulation   issued   under   the   1939   Code   was   in existence   when   the   1954 Code   was   enacted   and   Congress   did not   see   fit to make   any   changes;   that  Treasury   Regulations   have   the force   of law   when   the   Code   section   which  they   interpret   is reenacted   after   they   have   once   been   promulgated,   and  cites   Roberts   v.   Commissioner,   9 Cir.,   176   F.2d   221,   10 A.L.R.2d   186.  The Government has been   unable to present the Court   with any decision in which the meaning of “continuity of business enterprise” as used in the Treasury Regulations,   has been interpreted.   Since no Court had   upheld the contention made by the Government as   to the interpretation to be given said words in the Regulations, it is unfair to say   that Congress   had an opportunity to make a change in passing the 1954 Code. Congress was not apprised of the meaning that   the Government wishes to give to said language in the Regulations,   and therefore the   rule expressed in Roberts v. Commissioner, supra, is not controlling here. This Court finds that no court has passed on the question of whether  “continuity of business enterprise”, as used in the Regulations, means that   the new corporation must   engage in the identical type of business or  a similar business; and it  is, therefore,   held   that this Court is not bound  by any Treasury   Regulation since it is the province of the Court to decide whether the Treasury   Regulation means   what the Government contends it means;   and whether or not if  it means   what the Government contends, said Regulation is one   that   could   be promulgated   under the appropriate  sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  This Court finds   that “continuity of business enterprise”, as used in  the Regulations,   does not mean that   the new corporation must   engage in either   the same type of business as the old or   a similar   business, for if this be  the requirement,   then said Regulation is without authority.  To qualify as   a “reorganization”   under the   applicable   statutes,   the  new   corporation   does   not have to engage in  an   identical or similar   type of business.   All   that is required is that   there must be   continuity of  the  business activity. This  Court   therefore   finds   that   there   was a reorganization   under   the  applicable   sections   of  the  Internal   Revenue   Code.

ISSUE  For   a   transaction   to   qualify   as   a   reorganization   under   section  368(a)(1)   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   of   1954,   does   the   continuity   of  business   enterprise   requirement   apply   to the business   or business   assets of the   acquiring   (transferee)   corporation   prior to the   reorganization?  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Section   1.368—-1(b)   of   the   Income   Tax   Regulations   states   that   in order   for   a reorganization   to qualify   under   section   368(a)(1)   of the   Code  there   must   be   continuity   of the   business   enterprise   under   the   modified  corporate   form.  Rev.   Rul.   63-29,   1963-1   C.B.   77,   holds   that   the   continuity   of  business   enterprise   requirement   of section   1.868—1(b)   of the   regulations was   satisfied   where   a   transferee   corporation   sold   its   assets   and discontinued   its business,   then   acquired   the assets   of another   corporation in exchange   for its voting   stock,   and   used   the sales proceeds   realized   from  the   sale   of its   assets   to   expand   the   business   formerly   conducted   by the acquired   corporation.   The   holding   of Rev.   Rul.   63-29   is now   reflected   in  the   recent   amendment   to section   1.368—1   (1.868—1(d))   of the regulations,  which   looks   only to the   transferor’s   historic   business   or historic   business  assets   for   determining   if   the   continuity   of   business   enterprise requirement   is satisfied. HOLDING  In   a   section   368(a)(1)   reorganization   the   continuity   of   business enterprise   requirement   does   not   apply   to the business   or business   assets  of the transferee   corporation   prior to the   reorganization.  KK*  NOTE The   continuity of business   enterprise   doctrine   requires   P either to  continue T’s   historic business or   to use a significant   portion of  T’s   historic business   assets   in  a business.78   This   determination is based on all the   facts  78   Reg.   § 1.368—1(d)(1).  411

For example,   the  continuity of business enterprise doctrine is satisfied   in the acquisitive  reorganization setting even if P transfers the acquired T assets or stock to  controlled P subsidiaries, or In certain cases even to a partnership that 1s  controlled by the P corporate group.7? Numerous examples in the regulations  illustrate how the doctrine is applied to various transactional structures.®?  2.

In its simplest   form,   a Type   B reorganization   is P’s   acquisition   of T  stock   solely   in   exchange   for   P   voting   stock   (or   the   voting   stock   of P’s  parent)   provided   that   P   emerges   from   the   transaction   with   “control”   of T.8!   For   this   purpose,   “control”   is defined   as   ownership   of 80   percent   or more   of T’s voting   power   and   80   percent   or   more   of the   total   number   of shares   of each   class   of T’s   nonvoting   stock.82   When   the   smoke   clears,   T remains   as   a   controlled   subsidiary   of P.   A   transaction   that   otherwise qualifies   as a B reorganization   is not   disqualified   if P transfers   all or part of the   T stock   it acquires   to a controlled   subsidiary   of P.83  Solely for Voting Stock Requirement.   P “voting stock” is the only permissible   consideration in a Type   B reorganization. With a few minor  exceptions   discussed   below, the   use   of even an insignificant amount of  nonvoting stock,   debt, or cash will disqualify the transaction. As the courts have consistently held,   albeit with considerably   more verbiage,®4 that   there   can   be   “no   boot in a B.” But the nagging policy question remains: why should the requirements for a stock-for-stock   acquisition  be so strict when the acquiring   corporation in some other   types of  acquisitive reorganization   has the leeway to use from 20 to 60 percent  nonequity consideration?  The rigid requirements for a B reorganization   have   placed considerable   pressure on the   definition of “voting stock.” Although the  term is not   specifically defined in the Code,   “voting stock” has   been  79   Reg.   § 1.368-1(d)(4)   &   (5).  - Reg. § 1.368-1(d)(5).

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS  interpreted   to require   an   unconditional   right to vote   on   regular   corporate  decisions   (election   of   directors,   shareholder   proposals,   etc.)   and   not merely   extraordinary   events   such   as   mergers   or liquidations.®5   The   class of stock   transferred   is immaterial   provided   that   it has   voting   rights. Although   the   Supreme   Court   has   long held   that hybrid   equity   securities,  such   as   warrants   to purchase   additional   voting   stock,   do   not   constitute voting   stock,   contractual   rights   to   receive   additional   voting   stock   may  qualify.86 The   Service   has   allowed   the   parties   to   a   B   reorganization   some  flexibility   despite   the   stringency   of the   voting   stock   requirement.   For example,   the   “solely”   requirement   is   not   violated   if   the   acquiring  corporation   issues   cash   in   lieu   of   fractional   shares.87   The   acquiring  corporation   also   may   pay   the   target   corporation’s   expenses   (e.g.,  registration   fees,   legal   and   accounting   fees   and   other   administrative  costs)   related   to the   reorganization,   but   payment   of legal,   accounting   or  other   expenses   of   the   target’s   shareholders   will   constitute   forbidden boot.88   Certain   preferred   stock   with   debt-like   characteristics,   labelled   by  Section   351(g)   as   “nonqualified   preferred   stock,”89   is treated   as   boot   for  gain recognition   purposes   but remains   “stock”   for all other   purposes   until the   regulations   are   modified   and   provide   to   the   contrary.   Thus,   the receipt   by target   shareholders   of nonqualified   preferred   stock with   voting  rights   (an   unlikely   occurrence)   should   not   disqualify   a transaction   as   a  Type   B reorganization,   but   T shareholders   would   recognize   realized   gain  to the   extent   of the   value   of any   nonqualified   preferred   stock   received   in  exchange   for their   T stock.9  Buying   out   Dissenting   Shareholders.   A   particular   challenge   in planning   a   B   reorganization   involves   shareholders   of the   target   who insist on   receiving   cash.   If the   acquiring   corporation   pays   cash   directly to these   dissenters,   the   transaction   will   violate   the   solely   for voting   stock  requirement   and   all the   target’s   shareholders   must   recognize   gain.   But  the   Service   permits   the target   to redeem   the   shares   of dissenters   prior to  a valid   B   reorganization   provided   that   the   cash   does   not   emanate   from  the   acquiring   corporation   and   continuity   of interest   requirements   are  satisfied.21   Another   possible   approach   might   be   for   the   transaction   to proceed   as   a stock-for-stock   exchange,   followed   by a later   redemption   of the   acquiring   corporation   stock   held   by   the   dissenters.   If they   were  truly   dissenters,   however,   one   would   assume   they   would   have   sought  8   Cf. Reg.   § 1.802—3(a).  86 Helvering v.

414  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  some assurance, albeit informal, that the later redemption   would occur.  In   that event,   the redemption likely would be   part of the original  reorganization plan and, if so, the entire transaction would fail. Creeping   Acquisitions.   The   acquiring   corporation   is not   required   to  acquire   “control”   of T in a Type   B reorganization.   It simply   must   emerge  from   the   reorganization   with   control,   as   measured   by   the   80   percent  benchmarks   in   Section   368(c).   It   thus   is   possible   for   a   Type   B  reorganization   to be the   culmination   of a series   of acquisitions   of T stock  provided,   of course,   that   only   voting   stock   is used   as   consideration   and any   earlier   acquisitions   of T stock   for cash,   notes   or   other   consideration  were   “old and   cold”—i.e.,   unrelated   to the   final   stock-for-stock   exchange.  Whether   or   not   an   earlier   cash   acquisition   is unrelated   is essentially   a factual   “step   transaction”   question.   The   regulations   assume   that  acquisitions   are   related   if they   occur   over   a   short   time   span   (e.g.,   12  months)   but   not   if they   are   separated   by   very   long   interval   (e.g.,   16 years).93   This   leaves   a vast   middle   ground   of uncertainty.  Contingent   Payments   and   Escrowed   Stock Arrangements.   During   the negotiations   over   an   acquisitive   reorganization,   the parties   may   disagree  over   the   price   to   be   paid   for   the   target   corporation.   The   acquiring corporation   may   contend   that   the   target’s   earnings   are   unpredictable   or that   the   value   of the   business   is clouded   by   contingent   liabilities.   The  target   may   counter   by   producing   optimistic   earnings   projections.   A  common   method   of   breaking   this   type   of   stalemate   is   through   a contingent   consideration   agreement.   The   acquiring   corporation   may issue   a   specified   amount   of   stock   or   securities   and   agree   to   issue  additional   shares   under   specified   contingencies.   For   example,   additional  shares   may   be issued   to the former   target   shareholders   if the   earnings   of the   target   attain   certain   levels   during   a   specified   time   period   after   the acquisition.  There are a variety of methods to handle the payment of contingent consideration. The parties simply may agree   that additional   shares will be  issued on the happening of specified   events. The acquiring   corporation  may issue negotiable certificates   of contingent interest. Or the   parties  may take   the formal step of transferring the additional   shares to an escrow   agent   with   instructions to issue   the shares if certain   future   events  occur.  At one   time,   the   Service contended that contingent rights to acquire  additional   stock   violated   the   “solely for voting stock” requirement for   a  Type   B (and Type C) reorganization.   This   position was not sustained   by the   courts, however,   and the   Service now   concedes that contingent consideration will   not   disqualify   an   acquisitive   reorganization if certain conditions are   met.%4 The Service   has   issued   guidelines for approval of  93   Reg.   § 1.368—2(c).  4 See, e.g., Hamrick v. Commissioner,   43 T.C. 21   (1964),   acq.; Carlber 1  ;   , He ' AP ; é g v. United   States, 281   F.2d   507   (8th   Cir.1960).   The   Service   now   agrees   that   contingent   consideration is  not   boot

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS  contingent   and   escrowed   stock   arrangements.   The   more   important requirements   for   contingent   consideration   agreements   are:%   (1)   to ensure   compliance   with   the   continuity   of   interest   doctrine,   only additional   stock   can   be received;   (2) the acquiring   corporation   must   issue the   stock   within   five years   after   the   reorganization;   (3) the   arrangement  must   be   based   on   a valid   business   reason,   such   as   a valuation   dispute;  (4) there   is   a maximum   number   of contingent   shares   that   can   be issued;  (5) at least   50 percent   of the   maximum   number   of shares   of each   class   of stock   must   be issued   in the   initial   distribution;   (6) the   contingent   rights may   be   neither   assignable   nor   readily   marketable;   and   (7) the   events  triggering   the   issuance   of additional   stock   are   not   within   the   control   of  the shareholders.   Similar   requirements   are   imposed   where   the   acquiring  corporation   goes   beyond   merely   promising   to   issue   more   stock   and  actually   places   the   shares   in   escrow   with   an   independent   agent.   In addition,   escrowed   stock   must   be shown   as issued   and   outstanding   on the  acquiring   corporation’s   financial   statements,   and the target   shareholders must   be entitled   to any   dividends   paid   on   the   stock   and   voting   rights   if,  as   is required   in a Type   B reorganization,   the   escrowed   stock   has   voting  rights.%  3.

Type   C   reorganizations   are   known   as “practical   mergers”   because   their   end   result   is generally   the   same   as   a merger.   The   only   difference   may   be   the   form   of the   transaction   under  local corporate   law.   In a statutory merger,   all the assets   and liabilities of  the target   are   absorbed   by the acquiring   corporation   automatically,   while  an   asset   acquisition   technically   requires   a   “transfer”   ofassets   and  liabilities   undera   negotiated   agreement   and   does not necessarily require  the   target   to sell all of its assets   or to liquidate.9” Despite their   similarities in form, it is far more difficult   to qualify as  a Type   C stock-for-assets exchange than as   a Type A statutory merger  because of the more stringent   consideration   requirements. Section  368(a)(1)(C)   requires the   target to transfer   “substantially all’ of its  properties solely in exchange for voting  stock  of  the acquiring   corporation. Although “voting   stock” has the same   meaning for both B and   C  reorganizations, the term “solely” in Section   368(a)(1)(C) is subject to two  but   only if the contingent rights to additional   shares are   not   negotiable.   See   Rev.   Rul. 66-112,  1966-1 C.B. 68.  95 See   Rev.   Proc. 77-37,   supra   note   43, amplified   by Rev.   Proc. 84-42,   1984-1 C.B.   521.  96   Rev.

416 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  important exceptions. First, the assumption of liabilities by the acquiring corporation (or the taking of property subject to liabilities) is not treated as disqualifying boot.98 Second, a “boot relaxation rule” permits the  acquiring   corporation to use up to 20 percent boot, but for this purpose the transferred liabilities are considered as cash   consideration.99 A _  transaction thus can   qualify as   a Type   C reorganization when the  consideration consists of a substantial amount of debt relief as long as no  other   boot is used and sufficient voting stock is transferred to maintain  continuity of  interest. But a combination of debt relief and other   boot  hkely will spell doom for the transaction.  To   illustrate   the   operation   of these   rules,   assume   that   Target   (“T”)  has   gross   assets   of   $120,000   and   liabilities of $30,000.   Acquiring  Corporation   (“A”) proposes   to acquire   all of T’s assets   in exchange   for the  assumption   of $30,000 of liabilities   and   $90,000   of A   voting   stock.   The  transaction   qualifies   as   a C reorganization   because   the liabilities   are   not  treated   as boot.   But   if   A assumes   the   $30,000   of liabilities   and   transfers  $80,000   of voting   stock   and   $10,000   of cash,   the   transaction   does   not  qualify. The   liabilities   are   treated as “money   paid” for purposes   of the  boot   relaxation   rule,   and   thus   A   has   acquired   only   66%   percent   of the  $120,000 gross assets of T for voting stock. On these facts, A must   use   at  least   $96,000   of voting   stock   (80   percent   of $120,000)   in   order   for   the  transaction   to   qualify   as   a   Type   C   reorganization   under   the   boot relaxation   rule.   This.   example   illustrates   that   in   the   normal   situation  where   T’s liabilities   exceed   20 percent   of the   value   of its gross   assets,   no  boot   may   be used.  Substantially All of the Properties. The target also must transfer  “substantially all’ of its properties. The Service’s longstanding  distributions   (except for regular, normal distributions) made by the corporation   immediately   preceding the transfer and which are part of the  plan of reorganization will be considered as assets held by the corporation immediately prior to the   transfer.”101 Other authorities are not as  stringent in defining “substantially all,” and it is possible   that a complete  transfer of operating assets may qualify   even if the   Service’s percentage  tests   are not   met.192 Moreover, the   Service   has   ruled   that   the “substantially all” test  is met when the  target  corporation sells 50 percent  98   I.R.C.   § 868(a)(1)(C). 9   ~IR.C.   § 368(a)(2)(B).  100 Rev.

Liquidation   Requirement.   At one   time,   the   target   corporation   in a C reorganization   was   not required   to distribute   its assets   (which   ordinarily  will   consist   primarily   of voting   stock   of the   acquiring   corporation)   in complete   liquidation.   Some   targets   chose   to   stay   alive   as   a   holding  company   with a fresh   set of tax   attributes.194   Others   opted   to distribute  the   voting   stock   acquired   in the   reorganization   while   retaining   other  assets   that   might   trigger   adverse   tax   consequences   (e.g.,   a   dividend)   if distributed   to the   shareholders.!°>   To   prevent   these   and   other   perceived  abuses,   Congress   added   a new   rule   requiring   the   target   to distribute   all  of its   assets   pursuant   to   the   plan   of reorganization   unless   the   Service,  pursuant to regulations   that it has   yet   to issue,   agrees   to   waive   the  distribution   requirement.!9   In   the   event   of   a   waiver,   however,   the where   the   acquiring   corporation   has   previously   purchased   some   stock   of the   target   and   now   seeks   to assume   complete   control   by acquiring   all of  T’s   assets   through   a   liquidation   of T.   We   have   seen   that   a   creeping acquisition   will not   necessarily   poison   the final   stock-for-stock   exchange in a B reorganization,   at least   if the   stock   previously   acquired   for cash   is  “old   and   cold”—i.e.,   acquired   in   an   unrelated   transaction.   For   many  years,   creeping   C reorganizations   were   impeded   by the   Service’s   wooden  interpretation   of   the   “solely   for   voting   stock”   requirement.1°°   This longstanding   position has been   reversed   by regulations   providing   that P's prior ownership of a portion of T stock will not   by itself prevent the “solely for voting stock” requirement from bei 109 The Service finally came  to its senses   and   concluded   that   a transaction-in-which-P_converts an  103   Rey.

418   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  indirect   interest   in T’s assets   to a direct   interest   in those   assets   does   not necessarily   resemble   a taxable   sale by T of those   properties. To   enforce   the   statutory   continuity   of interest   rules,   the   regulations  provide   that   where   the   Section   368(a)(2)(B)   boot   relaxation   rule   applies  to the   final   step   of a creeping   Type   C reorganization,   the   sum   of: (1) the  money   or other boot distributed   to   T shareholders   other   than   P and   to T’s  creditors,   and   (2) the   liabilities of Tassumed   by   P, may   not   exceed 20  percent   of the   value   of all of T’s properties. 110   But   if P   acquires   T   stock from a   shareholder of T   or   T   itself   for   cash   or   boot   as   part   of   the acquisition,   such   consideration   is counted   as   boot   in   applying   the   boot  relaxation   rule.!!!   To illustrate,   assume   that   in an   unrelated   transaction  P acquired   60 percent   of the   stock   of T for cash.   T’s assets   have   a|   value of $110,   and   it has   $10 of liabilities.   Assume   T transfers   all its assets   to.  P and,   in exchange,   P assumes the   liabilities   and   transfers to T $30-0f   P  voting ‘stock   and   $10 of cash,   and   then   T   distributes   the   P   voting   stock  and   cash to   its   shareholders   (other   than   P)   and_liquidates.   This  transaction   will   qualify   as   a Type   C reorganization because   the   sum   of  cash   paid   and   liabilities   assumed   ($20)   does   not exceed   20   percent of the  value   of T’sassets.1!2   If, however,   P’s   cash acquisition   of 60   percent of T was   not   “old   and   cold’—i.e.,   was   related   to   the subsequent   asset acquisition—the   transaction   would   not qualify_as   tax-free   because   only 30 percent   of the   consideration   used   by P was   voting   stock.113 Step Transaction Issues. Assume T   Corporation is acquired by   P Corporation in a stock-for-stock exchange that   qualifies as   a Type   B  reorganization but, as part of an   overall acquisition plan, T   promptly liquidates, distributing its assets to P. Should the   overall transaction be treated as   a Type   C reorganization   and tested accordingly or should the two steps be considered independently in determining the   tax consequences? When would it make any difference? The IRS’s view on the application of the   step transaction to this   fact pattern is revealed in  Revenue Ruling   67-274, below.

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS  to Y which   assumed   all of the liabilities   of X. Y continued   to conduct   the  business   previously   conducted   by   X.   The   former   shareholders of X  continued   to   hold   16   percent   of   the   fair   market   value   of all   the  outstanding   stock   of Y.   re  Section   368(a)(1)(B)   of   the   Code   provides   in   part   that   a  reorganization   is the   acquisition   by one   corporation,   in exchange   solely  for   all   or   a   part   of its   voting   stock,   of stock   of another   corporation   if,  immediately   after   the   acquisition,   the   acquiring   corporation   has   control  (as   defined   in   section   368(c)   of   the   Code)   of   such   other   corporation.  Section   368(a)(1)(C)   of the   Code   provides   in part   that   a reorganization   is the   acquisition   by one   corporation,   in exchange   solely   for all or   a part   of its   voting   stock,   of   substantially   all   of   the   properties   of   another corporation,   but   in determining   whether   the   exchange   is solely   for stock the   assumption   by the   acquiring   corporation   of a liability   of the   other,   or the   fact that   property   acquired   is subject   to a liability,   is disregarded. Under   the   circumstances   of this   case   the   acquisition   of X stock   by Y  .   .   A   CS  and   the liquidation   of X by Y are   part of the overall   plan of reorganization  and the two steps may not be considered   independently   of each other for  Federal   income   tax purposes. See Revenue   Ruling   54-96,   1954-1   C.B.  111,   as   modified   by   Revenue   Ruling   56-100,   1956-1C.B.   624.   The  substance   of the   transaction   is an   acquisition   of assets   to which   section  368(a)(1)(B)   of the   Code   does   not   apply.  Accordingly,   the   acquisition   by Y of the   outstanding   stock   of X will  not constitute   a reorganization   within   the meaning of   section 368(a)(1)(B)  of the   Code   but will be considered   an   acquisition   of the   assets ofX which  in this   case   is a reorganization   described   in section 368(a)(1)(C)   of the  Coder   rr   ; 4.   TRIANGULAR   REORGANIZATIONS  Code: § 368(a)(1)(B) (first parenthetical) and (C) (first parenthetical),  (a)(2)(C), (D) & (B), (6).  Regulations: § 1.368—2(b)(2), (f), G)(1),   (3)-(6).  Background.   The three   basic types of reorganizations offer limited  flexibility if the acquiring   corporation desires to operate the   target as   a wholly owned subsidiary. Assume, for example, that   P, Inc. wishes to  acquire T, Inc. and   keep T’s business in a separate   corporation for nontax reasons. Although this objective   could be met   by a Type   B reorganization, the   stringent “solely for voting stock” requirement   might be   an insurmountable obstacle if P desired to use nonvoting stock as consideration or   if a large number of T   shareholders   were   unwilling to accept   any class   of P stock. Even the   flexible A reorganization   may not  be  feasible from a nontax   standpoint.   P  may not   wish to incur   the   risk of  T’s unknown or contingent liabilities which   would   remain P's responsibility   even if  T’s  assets   were   dropped   down to  a subsidiary.   P also  may   be   reluctant   to   bear   the   expense   and   delay   of   seeking   formal  419

420   TAXATION   OF C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  approval   of its shareholders   or unwilling   to provide   T shareholders   with the   appraisal   rights   to which   they   would   be   entitled   under   state   law   on  a direct   merger. To   maneuver   around   these   problems,   corporate   lawyers   developed  other   acquisition   methods   involving   the   use   of   a   subsidiary.   One  approach   is   for   P   to   acquire   T’s   assets   in   a   qualifying   Type   A   or   C  reorganization   and   immediately   drop   down   the   acquired   assets   to  newly   cmoated   “subsidies   This Technique   does nolmsdlves thedidded subsidiary.   This   technique   does   not solve   the   hidden  hability   problem,   however,   and   it   may   not   obviate   the   need   for shareholder   approval   and   appraisal   rights.1!4   An   alternative   is for   P to_  transfer   its stock   to   a new   subsidiary   (“S”),   and   then   cause   T to   merge  dineothyints S wits   theTsheehishiene resoivine P stock   and, perhaps,  other consideration in exchange for their T stock.   Or P could   form   S and  have   S acquire   substantially all of the  assets of T in exchange for P voting  stock. —  The tax consequences of these and other triangular acquisition techniques   have   been a major subplot within the reorganization drama.  In two early cases, the Supreme Court   constructed several   large  roadblocks by holding that transactions similar to those described   above  failed to satisfy the continuity of interest doctrine if: (1) T  merges into S  but T shareholders receive P stock in a triangular   reorganization, or (2)  P makes the acquisition using P stock but drops T or its assets down to a subsidiary.115  Over the years, Congress gradually came to recognize that   there was no reason to deny tax-free   status to “drop downs” or triangular reorganizations that were economically   equivalent to the simpler acquisition methods authorized by Section 368. In   the 1954   Code, it added Section 368(a)(2)(C), which provides that an otherwise   qualifying —  Type A or C reorganization will not lose its tax-free   status merel be  the acquiring   corporation   drops dowrrathe  anqcikediacie cage at eee  and it later  added-a similar rule for Type B reorganizations.  Congress  also permitted   the acquiring   corporation in a Bor   © reorganization to use  voting stock of its parent to make the   acquisition. For   both   drop downs  and triangular reorganizations,   Section   368(b) now makes it clear   that the   controlling parent will be a “party” to the reorganization.   But the  Service   persisted in ruling   that a merger of the   target into a controlled subsidiary of the acquiring  corporation   was not   tax-free when the   target  shareholders received stock of the paren   ause the parent was not a “party” to the reorganization and the T share older lacked continuity of  eee, & Q   :   :   : :  Drop downs” also  are inconvenient   because   they usually   require   an inordinate amount of paperwork (e.g., deeds   and   other documents of  transfer, with accompanying recording fees  and   transfer   taxes) as the   assets   pass   from the parent to the   subsidiary.

These cases   also suggested   that   in   no event   could   the   al  shareholders   receive   stock   in   both   S   and   P   because   the   receipt   of   stock   in   two   separate  corporations   violated   continuity   of  interest   requirements.

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  interest.46   Once   again,   Congress   responded   by   adding   two   new  categories   of tax-free   reorganizations:   the   Section   368(a)(2)(D)_ forward  triangular   merger   and   the   Section   _368(a)(2)(E)_   reverse triangular  merger.   Pa   ore  Forward   Triangular   Mergers:   Section   368(a)(2)(D).   From   the time   it was   authorized   as   a   tax-free   reorganization   in   1969,   the   forward triangular   merger   has   become   one   of the   most   widely   used   acquisition  techniques.   Section   368(a)(2)(D)   permits S to acquire   T in a _Sstatutory merger,   using   P stock_as   consideration,   provided   that:   (1) S S_ acquires  “substantially   all” ae   (2) no   stock   of S is used in the  transaction; and (3) the   transaction   would   have qualified_asa Type   A  reorganization.   if T   had   merged   directly   into   P.   In   typically   perverse  fashion; Congress—without expressly articulating   its rationale—reached  into   its bag   of requirements   and   borrowed   one   from   the   Type   C   model (“substantially   all of the properties”)   and   another   from   the Type   A model (the tests   for permissible   consideration).   Although   the legislative   history  is obscure,   it is now   clear   that   the   “could   have   merged   with   parent”   test  merely   requires   the   transaction   to pass   muster   under   the   continuity   of interest   doctrine.!!7   As   a result,   T shareholders   only must   receive   at least  50   percent   P   stock   (voting   or   nonvoting)   under   the   Service’s   continuity  guidelines,   allowing   the   parties   the freedom   to use   up   to 50 percent   cash and   other   nonequity   consideration.   Of   course,   the   T   shareholders   who receive   boot   must recognize their realized gain   to   that extent,   but   those  who   receive ve solely   stock   will enjoy   nonrecognition   if   the   overall  transaction   qualifies   under   these   liberal   standards.  Reverse   Triangular   Mergers:   Section   368(a)(2)(E).   Before   examining  the   tax   consequences   of a   reverse   triangular   merger,   the   transaction  itself must   be explained.   Suppose   P desires   to acquire   the   stock   of Tin   a tax-free   reorganization   and   keep T alive   as   a subsidiary,   but   P is unable (or unwilling)   to structure   the   deal as   a Type   B reorganization   because   of the   “solely   for voting   stock”   requirement.   Neither   a merger   nor   an   asset acquisition   is feasible   because   T, as   a corporate   entity,   has   a number   of intangible   assets   (e.g., grandfather   rights   under   state   law;   franchises   or leases;   favorable   loan   agreements)   that   would   be jeopardized   if T were dissolved   or   it   would   simply   take   longer   or   involve   cumbersome regulatory   hoops   to   structure   the   deal   as   a   merger.   One   ingenious  solution   to this   dilemma   is for P   to create   5S, contributing   to it P voting  stock,   and   then   for S to merge   into T under   an   agreement   providing   that  T shareholders   will receive   P stock   (and, possibly,   other   consideration) in _exchange   for their   T stock.’A   1 variation   on   the   theme,   albeit   a rare   one, would   be   to use   an   existing   subsidiary   with   ongoing   business   activities.  In   that   event,   the   reverse   merger   would   result   in   T’s   business   being  augmented   by S’s, all conducted   under   the   same   corporate   roof.   In either  6 Rey.

422   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  case,   when   the   smoke   clears   P   will   own   all   the   stock   of T   and   S   will  disappear   as   a result   of the   merger.  Section   368(a)(2)(E)   provides   that   this   type   of reverse   merger   will  qualify   as   a tax-free   reorganization   if: (1) the   surviving   corporation   (T) _  holds   substantially   all   of   the   properties   formerly   held   by   both corporations   (T and   8), and   (2) the former   T shareholders   exchange   stock  constituting   “control”   (measured   by   the   80   percent   tests   in   Section  368(c)(1)) for P voting   stock.118   Once   again,   Congress   borrowed   from   its  bag   of requirements   and   combined   tests   from   Type   A   (merger),   Type   B  (control)   and   Type   C (substantially   all of the properties)   reorganizations.  The   reverse   merger   is thus   less flexible   for tax purposes   than   the forward  triangular   merger,   perhaps   reflecting   its Type   B   origins.   But   there   can  be   boot   in   an   “(a)(2)(E)”   reorganization;   only   80   percent   of the   T   stock must   be   acquired   i   and   the   rest   may   be   obtained   for  fae   emeemee   a   grea   tet,   at allif P is willing   to put up   with   minority   shareholders.  Although Congress deserves applause for abandoning the  formalisms of the old case law, its piecemeal approach to triangular reorganizations is yet another example of the major flaw in the  reorganization   scheme. In enacting Sections   368(a)(2)(D) and (E), each  with its own distinct requirements,   Congress   added further embroidery  to what already had become a crazy quilt. As the Senate   Finance  Committee staff lamented in its preliminary report on the reform   and  simplification of Subchapter C, many of the arcane distinctions in Section  368 “defy rationalization” and “[n]o discernible   public policy would so  sharply   distinguish among the forms of   an acquisition   that are economically so similar.”119 Congress   would be well advised to move toward a system that would   impose consistent requirements on economically   equivalent acquisition   techniques. 120  5. MULTI-STEP   ACQUISITIONS  Regulations: § 1.338(h)(10)—1(c)(2).  We have seen   that choosing the optimal   structure for a corporate acquisition   involves a wide   range of  legal and strategical considerations.  From the buyer’s   perspective, important factors include determining the price to be  paid for the  target corporation   and the mix of consideration to be   used. Apart   from taxes, other factors driving   deal   structure are the accounting   treatment,   regulatory   hurdles, stock’ exchange rules, treatment of employer stock   options, and   timing, to name just a few.

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  For   all   these   reasons,   it   is   often   desirable   for   the   parties   to   an  acquisition   to   employ   a   multi-step _structure.For   example,   acquisitions  of public   companies   may   proceed   at a quicker   pace   if the   first   step   does  not   require   regulatory   clearance,   consents   from   lenders   or   others   with   a  contractual   relationship   to   P   or   T,   or   actions   that   could   impede   the momentum   of the   deal.   A good   example   of a two-step   acquisition   is when  P   makes   a   tender   offer   for T’s   stock   at   an   attractive   price   and   acquires  sufficient   stock   to achieve   control   (but   not   100   percent   ownership)   of T,  enabling   P   to orchestrate   a   merger   of T into   P   (or more   likely   into   a P  subsidiary),   squeezing   out   the   minority   shareholders.   The   non-tax aspects   of this   and   other   deal   structures   are   complex   and   beyond   the scope   of this text.   Our   concern   here   is to what   extent   the federal   tax laws have   accommodated   the   multi-step   acquisition   phenomenon. The   rulings   below   are   a   reflection   of the   Service’s   willingness   to  apply   the   step   transaction   doctrine   to   facilitate   multi-step  acquisitions.!21   This   often   results   in   qualifying   the   integrated transaction   as   a   tax-free   reorganization   where   the   separate   steps,   if viewed   in isolation,   would   not   qualify.

ISSUE  On   the   facts   described   below,   is   the   control-for-voting-stock  requirement   of § 368(a)(2)(E)   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   satisfied,   so  that   a   series   of integrated   steps   constitutes   a   tax-free   reorganization  under   §§ 368(a)(1)(A)   and   368(a)(2)(E)   and   § 354   or   § 356   applies   to each  exchanging   shareholder?  FACTS  Situation 1. Corporation _P  and Corporation T are widely held,  manufacturing corporations   organized   under the laws of state   A. T has only   voting common stock outstanding,   none of which is owned by P. P seeks to acquire all of the outstanding stock of  T. For valid business reasons,   the acquisition will be effected by a tender offer for at  least 51  percent of  the   stock of  T, to be acquired solely for P voting stock, followed  by a merger of a subsidiary o&D   into(D) P initiates a tender offer   for T stock sanuiitioned on the tender of  at   least   51 percent of  the T shares.  Pursuant to the tender offer, P acquires 51 percent of  the T stock from  _'T’s shareholders for P voting stock. P  forms   S and   S merges into T  under the merger   laws of   state   A.

424   TAXATION   OF   C   CORPORATIONS   PART   2  converted   into   T   stock   and   each   of the   T   shareholders   holding   the  remaining   49 percent   of the   outstanding   T stock   exchanges   its shares   of  T stock for a combination   of consideration,   two-thirds of whichisP voting  stock and   one-third   of   which   is   cash.   Assume   that   under   general  principles   of tax law, including the step transaction   doctrine,   the   tender  offer   and   the   statutory   merger   are   treated   as   an   integrated   acquisition  by P of all of the T stock.   Also   assume   that   all nonstatutory   requirements  for   a   reorganization   under   §§ 368(a)(1)(A)   and   368(a)(2)(E)   and   all  statutory   requirements   of   § 368(a)(2)(E),   other   than   the   requirement under   § 368(a)(2)(E)(ii)   that   P   acquire   control   of T   in   exchange   for   its voting   stock   in the transaction,   are   satisfied. Situation   2.   The   facts   are   the   same   as   in Situation   1, except   that   S  initiates   the tender   offer for T stock and,   in the   tender   offer,   acquires   51  percent   of   the   T stock   for P stock   provided   by P.  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Section   368(a)(1)(A) states that   the term “reorganization” means a  statutory merger or consolidation.   Section   368(a)(2)(E) provides that a  transaction otherwise qualifying under § 368(a)(1)(A) will not be  disqualified by reason of the fact that stock of a corporation (the  “controlling corporation”) that before the merger was in control of the  merged corporation is  used in the transaction, if (1) after the transaction,_  the corporation   surviving the merger holds   substantially all of its properties and of the properties   of the merged corporation (other than  stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction), and  (2) in the transaction, former   shareholders of the surviving   corporation  exchanged, for an amount of voting  stock of the. controlling   corporation,  an amount of stock in the surviving   corporation that consti   ntrol  of such corporation (the “control-for-voung-StGck requirement") For this  purpose,  control is defined   in § 368(c).  In King Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 418   F.2d   511 (Ct.Cl. 1969),  as part of an integrated plan, a corporation   acquired all of the   stock of a  target corporation   from the   target   corporation’s shareholders for  consideration, in excess of 50 percent of which   was   acquiring   corporation stock, and   subsequently merged the  target corporation into the acquiring  corporation. The court   held that, because the merger   was the intended  result   of the   stock   acquisition,   the acquiring   corporation’s   acquisition of  the  target corporation qualified as   a reorganization under   § 368(a)(1)(A).  **E*  Section   1.368-1(c) of  the Income   Tax   Regulations   provides   that a  plan of reorganization   must   contemplate the bona fide execution of  one  of  the   transactions specifically described as   a reorganization in § 368(a)  and   the bona fide consummation of each of  the requisite   acts under   which  nonrecognition of  gain is claimed.   Section   1.368—2(g)   provides   that   the  term   plan   of  reorganization is not   to be   construed as broadening   the definition   of  reorganization as   set  forth   in § 368(a),   but is to  be   taken as

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  limiting   the   nonrecognition   of   gain   or   loss   to   such   exchanges   or distributions   as   are   directly   a   part   of   the   transaction   specifically  described   as   a reorganization   in § 368(a).  As   assumed   in   the   facts,   under   general   principles   of   tax   law,  including   the step transaction   doctrine,   the tender   offer and   the statutory merger   in both   Situations   1 and   2 are   treated   as an integrated   acquisition by P of all of the   T stock.   The   principles   of King   Enterprises   support   the conclusion   that, because   the   tender   offer is integrated   with   the   statutory  merger   in both   Situations   1 and   2, the   tender   offer   exchange   is treated as   part   of   the   statutory   merger   (hereinafter   the   “Transaction”)   for  purposes   of the   reorganization   provisions.   Cf.   J.E.   Seagram   Corp.   v.  Commissioner,   104   T.C.   75   (1995)   (treating   a   tender   offer   that   was   an  integrated   step   in a   plan   that   included   a forward   triangular   merger   as  part   of   the   merger   transaction).   Consequently,   the   integrated   steps,  which   result   in   P   acquiring   all of the-stock   of T, must   be examined  together   to   determine   whether   the   SELVA   ease satisfied.   Cf.   § 1.368—2())(3)@);   § 1.368-29)(6),   Ex.   3   (suggesting   that, absent   a special exception,   steps   that are   prior to the merger,   but are   part of   the   transaction   intended   to   qualify   as   a   reorganization   under  §§ 368(a)(1)(A)   and   368(a)(2)(E),   should   be   considered   for   purposes   of  determining   whether   the   control-for-voting-stock   requirement   is  satisfied).  In   both   situations,   in   the   Transaction,   the   shareholders   of   T  exchange,   for P voting stock,   an   amount   of T stock   constituting in excess  of 80 percent of the voting stock of T. Therefore, the   control-for-voting-  stock requirement is satisfied. Accordingly, in both   Situations 1 and 2,  the Transaction qualifies as   a reorganization   under §§  368(a)(1)(A) and  368(a)(2)(E). ;  Under §§ 1.368-1(c) and 1.368—2(g), all of the T shareholders that  exchange their T stock for P stock in the Transaction will be   treated as exchanging their T stock for P stock in pursuance of a plan of reorganization.   Therefore, T shareholders that exchange their T stock only for P stock in  the Transaction will  recognize no gain or loss under  § 354. T shareholders that exchange their T stock for P stock and   cash in  the Transaction will recognize   gain to the extent provided in § 356. In  both   Situations 1 and 2, none of  P,  S, or T will recognize   any   gain or loss  in the Transaction,   and P’s basis in  the T stock will be determined   under  § 1.358-6(c)(2) by treating P as acquiring all of   the T stock in the Transaction   and not acquiring   any of  the T stock   before   the Transaction.  “HOLDING  On   the   facts   set   forth   in Situations   1 and   2, the control-for-voting-  stock   requirement   is   satisfied   in   the   Transaction,   the   Transaction constitutes.   a tax-free   reorganization   under   §§ 368(a)(1)(A)   and 368(a)(2)(E),   and   §  354 or §  356   applies to each   exchanging   shareholder.  425

426   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Revenue   Ruling   2008-25  2008-1   Cum.   Bull.   986.  ISSUE  What   is the   proper   Federal   income   tax   treatment   of the   transaction  described   below?  FACTS  T is a corporation   all of the   stock   of which   is owned   by individual   A.  T has   150x   dollars   worth   of assets   and   50x   dollars of liabilities.   P is a  corporation   that is unrelated   to A and   T. The   value   of P’s assets,   net   of  habilities,   is   410x   dollars. P   forms   corporation _X,   a   wholly   owned  subsidiary,   for the sole   purpose   of   acquiring   all   of the   stock   of T   by  causing   X   to   merge   into-T-in   a   statutory   merger   (the   “Acquisition  Merger”).   In the Acquisition   Merger,   Pacquires   all of the   stock   of T, and  A exchanges   the T stock for 10x dollars in cash_and   P voting stock worth  90x_dollars.   Following   the   Acquisition   Merger   and   as   part of an  integrated   plan   that   included   the   Acquisition   Merger,   T   completely  liquidates   into   P   (the   “Liquidation”).   In the   Liquidation,   T transfers   all of its assets   to   P and   P assumes   all of T’s   liabilities.   The   Liquidation   is not   accomplished   through   a   statutory   merger.   After   the   Liquidation,   P continues   to conduct   the business   previously   conducted   by T.  LAW  Section   368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that   the  term   “reorganization” means a statutory merger or consolidation.   Section 368(a)(2)(E) provides that a transaction   otherwise qualifying under  § 368(a)(1)(A) shall not be  disqualified by reason of the fact that   stock of  a corporation in control of the merged corporation is used in the  transaction, if () after the transaction,   the corporation   surviving the  merger holds substantially all of its properties and of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the   transaction), and (ii) in the transaction, former  shareholders of the surviving   corporation exchanged, for an amount of  voting stock of  the controlling   corporation, an amount of stock in the surviving   corporation which constitutes   control of the surviving corporation.   Further, § 1.368—2()(3)(iii) of the Income   Tax   Regulations provides that “[i]n applying the   ‘substantially all’ test   to the merged  corporation,   assets transferred   from the   controlling   corporation to the  merged corporation in pursuance of the plan of reorganization are   not  taken into account.” Section   368(a)(1)(C)   provides in   part   that a reorganization is the acquisition by one   corporation, in exchange solely   for all   or part   of its  voting stock,   of substantially all of  the   properties of another   corporation,  but   in determining   whether the exchange is solely   for   stock,   the assumption   by  the  acquiring   corporation   of  a  liability   of  the   other   shall  be   disregarded.   Section   368(a)(2)(B)   provides that if  one   corporation

--- Page 497 ---

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  acquires   substantially   all   of the   properties   of another   corporation,   the  acquisition   would   qualify   under   § 368(a)(1)(C)   but   for   the   fact   that   the acquiring   corporation   exchanges   money   or   other   property   in addition   to  voting   stock,   and   the   acquiring   corporation   acquires,   solely   for   voting  stock   described   in § 368(a)(1)(C),   property   of the other corporation   having a fair market   value   which   is at least   80 percent   of the   fair market   value  of all of the property   of the other   corporation,   then   such   acquisition   shall  (subject   to   § 368(a)(2)(A))   be   treated   as   qualifying   under   § 368(a)(1)(C). Section   368(a)(2)(B)   further   provides   that   solely   for   purposes   of  determining   whether   its requirements   are   satisfied,   the   amount   of any  liabilities   assumed   by   the   acquiring   corporation   shall   be   treated   as money   paid for the property.  Section   1.868—1(a)   generally   provides   that in determining   whether   a transaction   qualifies   as   a reorganization   under   § 368(a),   the   transaction  must   be   evaluated   under   relevant   provisions   of law,   including   the   step transaction   doctrine.  Section   1.368—2(k)   provides,   in   part,   that   a   transaction   otherwise qualifying   as   a reorganization   under   § 368(a)   shall   not   be disqualified   or  recharacterized   as   a result   of one   or   more   distributions   to shareholders  (including   distribution(s)   that   involve   the assumption   of liabilities)   if the requirements   of   § 1.368-1(d)   are   satisfied,   the   property   distributed consists   of assets   of the   surviving   corporation,   and   the   aggregate   of such distributions   does   not   consist   of an   amount   of assets   of the   surviving  corporation   (disregarding   assets   of the   merged   corporation)   that   would  result   in   a   liquidation   of   such   corporation   for   Federal   income   tax  purposes.  Rev. Rul. 67-274,   1967-2 C.B.   141, holds   that   an acquiring corporation’s   acquisition of all of the   stock of a target corporation solely in exchange for voting stock of the acquiring corporation,   followed by the liquidation of the   target corporation as part of the same plan, will be  treated as an acquisition by the acquiring   corporation of substantially all  of the   target   corporation’s assets in a reorganization   described in  § 368(a)(1)(C). The ruling   explains that, under these circumstances, the stock   acquisition and the   liquidation are part of   the   overall plan of  reorganization   and the two steps may not  be considered   independently of  each   other for Federal   income tax purposes.   See also, Rev. Rul. 72—405,  1972-2 C.B.   217.  Rev.   Rul. 2001-46,   2001-2 C.B.   321,   holds that, where a newly  formed   wholly owned subsidiary of  an acquiring   corporation merged into ~a  target   corporation,   followed by the merger of  the target  corporation into the   acquiring   corporation,   the   step   transaction   doctrine is applied to integrate the steps and treat   the  transaction as  a single  statutory   merger of  the target corporation into  the  acquiring   corporation.  Noting that the  rejection   of step   integration   in   Rev.   Rul.   90-95,   1990-2   C.B.   67, and §  1.338-8(d) is based   on   Congressional   intent   that   §  338   replace   any nonstatutory   treatment   of  a  stock   purchase as   an   asset   purchase   under  427

--- Page 498 ---

428   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  the   Kimbell-Diamond   doctrine,   the   Service   found   that   the   policy  underlying   § 338 is not violated   by treating   the steps   as a single statutory merger   of   the   target   into   the   acquiring   corporation   because   such treatment   results   in a transaction   that   qualifies   as   a reorganization   in  which   the   acquiring   corporation   acquires   the   assets   of   the   target  corporation   with   a carryover   basis   under   § 362,   rather   than   receiving   a  cost basis   in those   assets   under   § 1012.   (In Kimbell-Diamond   Milling   Co.  v.   Commissioner,   14 T.C.   74, aff'd per   curiam,   187   F.2d   718   (1951),   cert.  denied,   342   U.S.   827   (1951),   the court   held   that   the   purchase   of the   stock  of a target   corporation   for the   purpose   of obtaining   its assets   through   a  prompt   liquidation   should   be   treated   by the   purchaser   as   a purchase   of  the   target   corporation’s   assets   with   the   purchaser   receiving   a cost   basis in the   assets.) Section   338(a) provides that if  a corporation makes a qualified   stock  purchase and makes an   election under that section, then the   target corporation (i) shall be  treated as having sold all of its assets at the close  of the acquisition date at fair market value and (ii) shall be   treated as a  new corporation which   purchased all of its assets as of the beginning of the day after the acquisition date. Section 338(d)(3)   defines a qualified stock purchase as any   transaction or series   of transactions in which stock (meeting the requirements of § 1504(a)(2)) of one corporation is acquired by another   corporation by   purchase during a 12-month acquisition  period. Section   338(h)(8)   defines a purchase generally as any acquisition  of stock, but   excludes   acquisitions of stock in exchanges to which § 351,  § 354, § 355, or § 356 applies. Section   338 was   enacted in 1982 and   was   “intended to replace any  nonstatutory   treatment of a stock purchase as an   asset purchase   under  the Kimbell-Diamond doctrine.” H.R. Conf. Rep.   No. 760, 97th Cong,   2d  Sess. 536 (1982), 1982-2 C.B.   600,   632. Stock purchase or asset purchase  treatment generally   turns on whether the purchasing corporation makes  or is deemed to make a § 338 election. If the   election is made or deemed  made, asset purchase   treatment results and the basis of the  target   assets  is adjusted to reflect the   stock purchase price and other   relevant items.  If an   election is not made or deemed made, the   stock purchase   treatment  generally results. In such a case, the   basis of the   target   assets is not adjusted to reflect the   stock purchase price and other   relevant items.  Rev.   Rul. 90-95 (Situation 2), holds   that   the merger of a newly  formed   wholly owned domestic   subsidiary into a target corporation   with  the target corporation   shareholders   receiving solely cash in exchange for  their   stock, immediately followed by the merger of  the   target   corporation into   the domestic   parent of  the merged subsidiary, will be   treated as   a  qualified   stock purchase of  the   target   corporation   followed by a § 332  liquidation   of the target   corporation.   As a result,   the  parent’s   basis   in  the  target   corporation’s   assets   will be  the same as the   basis   of  the   assets   in the target  corporation’s   hands.   The   ruling explains   that   even   though “the  step-transaction   doctrine is properly   applied to disregard   the existence   of

--- Page 499 ---

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS   429  the   [merged   subsidiary],”   so   that   the   first   step   is   treated   as   a   stock purchase,   the   acquisition   of the   target   corporation’s   stock   is   accorded  independent   significance   from   the   subsequent   liquidation   of the   target  corporation   and,   therefore,   is   treated   as   a   qualified   stock   purchase  regardless   of whether   a   § 338   election   is made.   Thus,   in that   case,   the step   transaction   doctrine   was   not   applied   to   treat   the   transaction   as   a  direct   acquisition   by   the   domestic   parent   of   the   assets   of   the   target  corporation   because   such   an   application   would   have   resulted   in treating  a stock   purchase   as   an   asset   purchase,   which   would   be inconsistent   with  the   repeal   of the   Kimbell-Diamond   doctrine   and   § 338. Section   1.838—3(d)   incorporates   the approach   of Rev.   Rul.   90—95   into  the   regulations   by requiring   the   purchasing   corporation   (or   a member   of  its affiliated   group)   to treat   certain   asset   transfers   following   a qualified stock   purchase   (where   no   § 338   election   is made)   independently   of the qualified   stock   purchase.   In the example   in § 1.338—3(d)(5),   the purchase for cash   of 85 percent   of the   stock   of a target   corporation,   followed   by the  merger   of the   target   corporation   into   a wholly   owned   subsidiary   of the purchasing   corporation,   is   treated   (other   than   by   certain   minority shareholders)   as   a   qualified   stock   purchase   of the   stock   of the   target  corporation   followed   by a   § 368   reorganization   of the   target   corporation  into   the   subsidiary.   As   a   result,   the   subsidiary’s   basis   in   the   target  corporation’s   assets   is the   same   as   the   basis   of the   assets   in the   target  corporation’s   hands.  ANALYSIS  If   the   Acquisition   Merger   and   the   Liquidation   were   treated   as  separate   from   each   other,   the   Acquisition   Merger   would   be treated   as   a  stock   acquisition   that   qualifies   as   a reorganization   under   § 368(a)(1)(A) by   reason   of   § 368(a)(2)(E),   and   the   Liquidation   would   qualify   under § 332.   However,   as   provided   in § 1.368-1(a),   in   determining   whether   a  transaction   qualifies   as   a reorganization   under   §   368(a),   the   transaction  must   be   evaluated   under   relevant   provisions   of law,   including   the   step  transaction   doctrine.

Accordingly,   the Acquisition   Merger  and   theLiquidation may   not be considered   independently ofeach   other for   purposes   of   determining   whether   the   transaction   satisfies   the statutory   requirements   of a reorganization   described   in § 368(a)(1)(A)   by  reason   of § 368(a)(2)(E).

However,   unlike   the transactions   considered   in Revenue   Rulings   67—  274,   72-405   and   2001—46,   a   direct   acquisition   by P of T’s   assets   in this  case   does   not   qualify   as   a reorganization   under   § 368(a).   P’s   acquisition  of T’s   assets   is not   a reorganization   described   in   § 368(a)(1)(C)   because  the   consideration   exchanged   is   not   solely   P   voting   stock   and   the requirements   of   § 368(a)(2)(B)   are   not   satisfied.   Section   368(a)(2)(B) would   treat   P as acquiring   40 percent   of T’s assets   for consideration   other than   P voting   stock   (liabilities   assumed   of 50x   dollars,   plus   10x   dollars  cash).   See   Rev.   Rul.   73-102,   1973-1   C.B.   186   (analyzing   the   application  of   § 368(a)(2)(B)).   P’s   acquisition   of T’s   assets   is   not   a   reorganization  described   in   § 368(a)(1)(D)   because   neither   T   nor   A   (nor   a   combination thereof)   was   in   control   of   P   (within   the   meaning   of   § 368(a)(2)(H)(i))  immediately   after   the   transfer.   Additionally,   the   transaction   is   not   a reorganization   under   § 368(a)(1)(A)   because   T   did   not   merge   into   P. Accordingly,   the   overall   transaction   is   not   a   reorganization   under § 368(a). Additionally, P’s acquisition of the T stock in the Acquisition Merger is not a transaction to which § 351   applies because A does not control P (within the meaning of § 368(c)) immediately after the exchange. Rev. Rul. 90-95 and § 1.338-83(d)   reject the   step integration approach reflected in Rev. Rul. 67-274   where the application of that  approach   would treat the purchase of a target corporation’s stock without  a § 338 election followed by the liquidation or merger of the   target  corporation as the purchase of the  target corporation’s assets resulting in a cost basis   in the   assets under § 1012. Rev. Rul. 90-95   and § 1.338-3(d) treat the acquisition of the   stock of the   target corporation as   a qualified  stock purchase followed by a separate   carryover basis transaction in order to preclude   any nonstatutory   treatment of the   steps as an integrated asset purchase.  In this case, further   application of the approach reflected in Rev.   Rul. 67-274,   integrating the acquisition of T stock with the liquidation of T, would result   in treating the acquisition of T stock as a taxable purchase  of  T’s   assets. Such   treatment   would violate   the   policy underlying   § 338 that a cost basis in acquired assets should not be obtained through the  purchase of stock where no § 338 election is made.   Accordingly, consistent   with the   analysis set forth   in Rev.   Rul. 90-95, the   acquisition of the   stock   of T is treated as   a qualified   stock purchase   by P followed by  the  liquidation of T into P under §. 332:  HOLDING The   transaction is not a reorganization   under   § 368(a). The Acquisition   Merger is a qualified   stock purchase   by P of  the   stock   of T  under   § 338(d)(3). The   Liquidation is   a complete   liquidation   of   a controlled   subsidiary   under   § 332,

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS  NOTE  Experienced   tax   professionals   have   come   to understand   that   “the   step- transaction   doctrine   generally   applies   ...   except   when   it doesn’t.”!22   What factors   in   the   rulings   above   supported   application   of the   doctrine?   Was   it because   the   first   step   was   conditioned   on   the   second   occurring?   Does  Revenue   Ruling   2001—26   offer   any   guiding   principle   for   application   of the  doctrine,   or   does   it simply   assume   for purposes   of analysis   that   the   tender  offer   and   merger   should   be integrated?  A   critical   point   made   in the   most   recent   multi-step   acquisition   rulings  is that application   of the step transaction   doctrine   is permissible   when   it does  not violate   the policy of Section   338.   What   policy?   Does   that   suggest   that the step   transaction   doctrine   should   not   be   applied   to   the   prototype   Kimbell-  Diamond   transaction   where   P purchases   80 percent   or more   of T’s stock   and  promptly   liquidates   T, winding   up   with   direct   ownership   of its assets?   If the  step   transaction   doctrine   did   apply   to that   fact pattern,   P would   take   a cost  basis   in T’s   assets   even   though   no   Section   338   election   was   made—a   result clearly   at variance   with   the   policy   of Section   338.  What   if the   first   step   is a   qualified   stock   purchase   under   Section   338,  and   P and S (T’s corporate   parent)   jointly make   a Section   338(h)(10)   election?  In that   situation,   should   the first step be viewed   in isolation   for tax purposes  or   should   step   transaction   principles   be   applied,   resulting   in reorganization  treatment   and   nullification   of the   Section   338   election?   What   if T is not   a subsidiary   and   P unilaterally   makes   a Section   338   election?  The   Service   has   issued   regulations   answering   some   of these   questions. They   provide   that   the step transaction   doctrine   will not apply to a multi-step  acquisition   if the   first   step   is a   qualified   stock   purchase   under   Section   338  and   the   parties   to the   transaction   make a joint   Section   338(h)(10)   election with   respect   to that   step,   whether   or not   the   overall   transaction   would   have qualified   as   a reorganization.!23   To   illustrate,   assume   that   P, Inc.   owns   all  the   stock   of Y, Inc.,   a newly   formed   subsidiary,   and   S, Inc.   owns   all the   stock  of T, Inc.   As   the   first step   in P’s acquisition   of T’s assets,   Y, Inc.   merges   into  T, with   T surviving,   and S (T’s only shareholder)   receives   50 percent   P voting stock   and   50 percent   cash.   This   step,   viewed   independently,   does   not   qualify  as   a reorganization   and   does   constitute   a   qualified   stock   purchase.   T then merges   into   P. If P and   S do not   make   a Section   338(h)(10)   election,   the   step  transaction   doctrine   would   be   applied,   and   the   overall   acquisition   would   be  treated   as a Section   368 reorganization.   But   if P and   S jointly make   a Section 338(h)(10)   election,   the   regulations   “turn   off’   the   step   transaction   doctrine  and   treat   P’s acquisition   of the   T stock   in the   reverse   merger   as   a qualified stock   purchase,   causing   “old   T” to recognize   gain or loss   on   the   deemed   sale  ~of its assets and   “new T”—and then   P,  after  the merger into P—to take a cost  basis   in its assets.124 If, however, the first step   does   not  constitute a qualified stock purchase   under Section 338(d)(3)—such as where the first step, viewed  122 See   Stratton,   “Step-Transaction   Doctrine   Tested   Under   Corporate   Rulings,”   93 Tax Notes   332   (Oct.   15,  2001),   quoting   an   I.R.S.   official who   was   quoting   an unnamed law   professor. 123   Reg.   § 1.338(h)(10)—1(¢)(2). 124 Reg.   §  1.338(h)(10)—1(e)   Examples 11  and 12.  431

Revenue   Ruling   2008-25   is   unique   insofar   as   it “turns   on”   the   step  transaction   doctrine   for   purposes   of concluding   that   P’s   acquisition   of T’s  assets   and   assumption   of   its   liabilities   fail   to   qualify   as   a   Type   C  reorganization   but   then   “turns   off’ the   doctrine   in determining   the ultimate  tax   consequences   of the   failed   reorganization.   The   reason   for   this   seeming inconsistency   is the   Service’s   obsession   with   protecting   the   policy   of Section 338.   The   upshot   is that   because   P’s   acquisition   of T   stock   (Step   1) did   not  qualify   as   a   reorganization,   it is   treated   as   a   Section   338   qualified   stock  purchase   followed   by a tax-free   liquidation   of T under   Section   332.   The   bad news   is that   T’s sole   shareholder,   A, who   could   reasonably   have   expected   to  limit   his   gain   to the   $10x   cash   received   in the   initial   reverse   merger,   must  recognize   his entire   gain just as   if he   sold   his   stock   for all cash.   Since   P did  not   make   a Section   338   election,   T does   not   recognize   gain   on   its assets,   and P takes   those   assets   with   a carryover   rather   than   cost   basis. Would the   result have   been the same if the second step in Revenue Ruling 2008-25 had   been an upstream merger of T into P rather than a liquidation?  PROBLEMS 1. Publishing Company, Inc.

CHAPTER   9   ACQUISITIVE   REORGANIZATIONS   435  4.   Are   the   results   reached   in Problems   1-3,   above,   rational   as   a matter   of  tax   policy?   Would   it be   preferable   to have   uniform   tax   rules   governing   all  corporate   acquisitions?  C.   TREATMENT   OF   THE   PARTIES   TO   AN   ACQUISITIVE  REORGANIZATION  Up   to this   point,   we   have   been   concentrating   on   the   definition   of a  reorganization   in   Section   368.   Compliance   with   those   statutory requirements   and   the judicial   doctrines   unlocks   the   gate   to the operative provisions,   which   govern   the   tax   treatment   of the   target   shareholders and   corporations   that   are   “a party   to   a reorganization”   and   provide   for transferred   and   exchanged   bases,   tacked   holding   periods   and   the carryover   of corporate   tax   attributes   such   as earnings   and   profits   and   net  operating   losses.   Section   3868(b)   broadly   defines   “a   party   to   a  reorganization”   to   include   any   corporation   resulting   from   a   qualifying reorganization   (e.g.,   the   surviving   corporation   in   a   consolidation),   the acquiring   and   target   corporations   in a straight   acquisitive   reorganization and   the parent   corporation   in a “drop   down’   or triangular   reorganization. This   section   summarizes   the   operative   provisions,   beginning   with the   tax   consequences   to   the   target’s   shareholders   and   security   holders  and   then   turning   to   the   treatment   of   the   target   and   acquiring  corporations.  1.

One of the   principal   benefits of  reorganization status is the nonrecognition   granted to the shareholders  and security   holders of the   target corporation   under Section 354(a).  Shareholders are entitled to complete   nonrecognition only when they  receive solely   stock or securities   of the acquiring corporation.!”6   This  invariably occurs in a Type   B reorganization,   but the  target shareholders in a Type A, C or any   form of triangular   reorganization may receive some boot. In that   event,   the shareholder   must recognize   any realized   gain to the   extent of  the money plus   the fair market   value of any other  boot” . received.127 For  this  purpose, boot includes   any   property   other   than stock or securities   of a party to the  reorganization.   To prevent   avoidance of  this rule through the   use   of  debt   “securities,”!28   Section   356(d)   provides   that if the   principal   _amount   he_principal  126   TRC.   § 354(a)(1).  1227   T.R.C.   § 356(a)(1).  128   “Securities”   are   generally   defined   to   encompass   relatively   long-term   corporate   debt  instruments   but   not   short-term   notes,   stock   rights   or warrants.

But   security   holders   who   change   their investment   to an   equity   interest   or   exchange   securities   for the   same   or lesser   principal   amount   have   not   significantly   changed   the   form   of their investment   and   therefore   are   entitled   to   nonrecognition   treatment.   As might   be   expected,   however,   a   shareholder   or   security   holder   who receives   boot   may   not   recognize   any   realized   loss.139 Characterization   of   Gain.   Section   356(a)(2)   provides   that   any recognized gain is treated as a dividend to a target shareholder if the exchange “has the effect of the distribution of a dividend.” In  that   event,  each T shareholder must treat as a dividend the amount of his recognized  gain that is not in excess of that shareholder’s ratable share of the corporation's accumulated earnings   and profits.131 Any remaining gain is  treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the   target   stock or securities  fp. ee i ee   ee ee  transferred. BSTC ET ES  The “boot dividend” issue   historically was one of the most difficult  questions arising under the operative provisions. The Service once  contended that dividend treatment was automatic if boot were  received,!82 but it later conceded that dividend equivalence   should be  determined   by using the tests applicable to stock redemptions in Section  302(b),183 treating the boot as   if  it were received as a distribution in  redemption of the target  corporation’s stock  immediately prior to the  reorganization   exchange.   axpayers argued, however, that dividend  thsi alanteMEHG debe ice by examining the effect of the  reorganization exchange as a whole, an approach that ultimately   was  adopted   by the Supreme Court in Clark v. Commissioner.!35 Under the  Clark test, each T   shareholder is treated as initially receiving   only P stock instead of the combination of P stock and boot   actually   received, and   then P is treated as having distributed the   boot in a hypothetical redemption of the portion of P stock not actually   received by the T shareholder. If this redemption meets one of the tests   for exchange  129 See L.R.C. § 354(a)(2)(A).  130 T.R.C. § 856(c).  131 Note that   the gain is not automatically   characterized as ordinary   income but, if it has the effect of a dividend, it is treated as  132   See Commissioner v.

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS 437  treatment in Section 302(b), the  receipt of boot does not have the effect of a dividend, and the shareholder recognizes capital gain or loss.  Otherwise, as previewed above, the recognized gain is a dividend (likely  a qualified dividend taxable at long-term capital gains rates) to the extent of the shareholder’s ratable share of “the corporation’s”136 accumulated earnings and profits, and any remaining gain is capital  gain.  Whenever   there   is a meaningful   rate   preference   for long-term   capital  gains   and,   unlike   current   law,   dividends   are   taxed   as   ordinary   income   at  the   highest   marginal   rates,   individual   taxpayers   will   benefit   from   the  Supreme   Court’s   holding   in   Clark.137   Corporate   shareholders,   however,  ordinarily   will prefer   dividend   classification   in order   to   qualify   for   the  dividends   received   deduction   under   Section   243.138   Dividend   treatment  also   may   be   preferable to the acquiring corporation   because   it reduces  the   earnings   and   profits   that   are   inherited   under   Section   381   as   a result of the reorganization.   Finally,   dividend   classification   may   be undesirable where   shareholders   receiving   notes   from   the   acquiring   corporation   wish to   report   their   gain   on   the   installment   method.   Unless   the   target   stock exchanged   by   the   shareholder   is   publicly   traded,139   installment   sale treatment   generally   is available   if the transaction   is treated   as   a sale but not   if the   receipt   of   installment   boot   is   treated   as   a   dividend   under  Section   356(a)(2).14°  The   boot   dividend   issue   rarely   is   important   to   individual  shareholders,   however,   as long   as   dividends   and   long-term   capital   gains  are   taxed   at the same preferential rate. Since   any   amount   characterized  as   a   dividend   under   Section   356(a)(2)   may   not   exceed   the   shareholder’s  recognized   gain,   the   shareholder   is always   entitled   to recovery   of basis.  If the   dividend   is “qualified,”   the   rate   is the   same   unless   the   capital   gain is short-term   (or the   stock   is not   a capital   asset),   in which   case   dividend  treatment   is   preferable.   For   transactions   involving   U.S.   corporations, corporate   shareholders   will   continue   to   prefer   dividend   classification  because   of the   dividends   received   deduction,   and   dividend   treatment   is  preferable   to the   acquiring   corporation   because   it reduces   earnings   and  profits   inherited   from   the   target   corporation   on   the   reorganization.  Allocation   of Consideration.   The   regulations   provide   guidance   for T shareholders   who   receive   a   mix   of consideration   or   surrender   different blocks   or   classes   of   stock   or   securities   in   a   tax-free   reorganization.  Consider,   for   example,   the   tax   consequences   to   a   T   shareholder   who  136 The statute is unclear,   but   the majority   view   appears to be   that   the dividend  determination   should be based on   the  target   corporation’s   earnings   and profits. 137 The Service, as   it must,   has announced that it will apply the   Clark approach to an acquisitive   reorganization.   See   Rev.   Rul. 93-61,   1993-2 C.B.   118.  138 But see   I.R.C. § 1059(e)(1)(B), which treats any amount treated as   a dividend on a non  pro   rata redemption of a corporate   shareholder's   stock as an “extraordinary   dividend.”   See  Chapter   4F3,   supra. 139   See   I.R.C.   § 453(k)(2). 140 See   I.R.C.   §  453(f)(6);   Prop.

The regulations   adopt   a default   rule   that   under   which   the boot   is allocated   to each   share   of stock   on   a   pro rata   basis,   according   to the fair market   value  ofthesurrendered shares. Butinarare   taxpayer-friendly   gesture,   the  regulations give the parties flexibility   to specify   how   the   consideration received   should be allocated   as long as the specification   is “economically  niultiple   blocks   or   different   classes   of   stock   with   different   bases   can minimize   her   recognized   gain   by allocating   boot   to the   blocks   or   classes  with   the   highest   per-share   basis.  To   illustrate,   assume   shareholder   A   owns   two   10-share   lots   of   T  stock   each   of which   has a fair   market   value   of $100.   A’s   basis   for Block   1  is $30   ($3   per   share)   and   her   basis   for   Block   2 is $90   ($9   per   share).   P  acquires   T   in   a   statutory   merger   that   qualifies   as   a   Type   A reorganization.   A   surrenders   her   T   stock   and   receives   in   exchange   10  shares   of P stock   worth   $100   and   $100   cash,   and   the   receipt   of cash   does  °°   ot have the effect of a distribution of a dividend. A’s realized gain is thus  $70 on Block 1 and   $10 on Block 2,  for a total   of $80 realized gain on the  transaction. If the terms of the merger do not specify   that   the P shares  and cash are received in exchange for particular   shares or classes of T  stock, the   default rule requires that a pro rata_portion   of the cash is  treated as received in exchange for each   share of T stock based on the fair  recognize   $50 of her $70 realized gain on Block 1 and all $10 of her  realized gain on Block 2.142 But if the terms of the merger specify   that A  receives 10 shares of P stock in exchange for A’s Block 1 shares and   $100 cash in exchange for his Block 2 shares and those terms are economically reasonable, 143 A is not required to recognize   any of her $70 realized gain  on Block 1 (because   none of the   boot was allocated to that   block) and recognizes   $10 of gain on Block 2.144  Dividend Within   Gain Approach: Policy   Aspects.   Section   356(a)(2)  limits   t ividend der’s recognized  gain. Over 40  years ago,   this approach   was criticized as  a “curious mixing  of dividend   and sale or exchange concepts” which   “permits   shareholders  with a high basis in  their   stock * * * to withdraw corporate   earnings   ina reorganization   without   dividend   consequences.”!45 Allowing   taxpayers to  recover their  basis even when a transaction is equivalent to  a dividend is  inconsistent   with the rules applicable to stock redemptions in Section   302  and is difficult  to  justify.

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS  Department has at times proposed to repeal the “dividend   within gain”  rule, arguing that “[t]here is not a significant policy reason to vary the tax treatment of a distribution that otherwise qualifies as   a dividend by reference to whether it is received in a reorganization * * * with the treatment afforded ordinary distributions under section 301.146 Basis   and   Holding   Period.   Target   shareholders   determine   the basis of nonrecognition   property   (i.e., the   stock   or   nonboot   securities   received  in the exchange)   under   Section   358 by reference   to their basis   in the stock  that   they relinquished,   increased   by   any   gain recognized   and   reduced   b any   boot received and   liabilities   assumed.   Any   boot   (other   than   cash)  Bas ciretitakesesRiteiinet Sas BAO value basis under Section 358(a)(2). This is  the   same   formula   used   many   chapters   ago   in   determining   the   basis   of  stock   received   in   a   Section   351   exchange.   If   different   types   of nonrecognition   property   are   received   (e.g.,   two   classes   of stock   or   stock  and   bonds), the aggregate   exchar   is   j   ted   among   those  properties   in   proportion   to their   relative   fair   market   values   under   rules  provided   in   the   regulations.147   The   nonrecognition   property   generally takes   a   tacked   holding   period   under   Section   1223(1)   and   the   holding  period of the boot commences on the date of its acquisition.  The   general   basis   rule in Section   358 is simple   enough   to apply when a target   shareholder   acquired   all of her   T stock   at the   same   time.   But   it  is not   uncommon   for a shareholder   to have   acquired   T stock   at different  times,   for different   prices.   When   these   multiple   “tax   lots”   of T stock   are exchanged   in   a   tax-free   reorganization   for   stock   of   the   acquiring  corporation,   can   T shareholders   use   the   average   basis   in their   T shares  to   determine   the   basis   for   all   their   new   P   stock   or   must   they   use   an  approach   under   which   the   basis   of the   P stock   received   is traced   to the basis   of the   different   blocks   of T stock   surrendered?   And   does   it matter  how   the   shares   are   held—e.g.,   in   certificates   that   can   be   physically identified,   or   a   brokerage   account   where   separate   lots   may   be   more difficult   or impossible   to track?148 From   the   standpoint   of simplicity   and   administrative   convenience,  the   average   basis   method   has   much   to offer even   when   separate   lots are  easily identifiable.   But   to prevent   potential   tax   avoidance   and   also allow taxpayers   some   flexibility,   the   Service   has   concluded   that   tracing   is the preferable   approach.!49   Under   the   regulations,   the   basis   of the   stock Se   a   ne   2   El   ee  received   in a reorganization   transaction,   to the   gr   ible  146 General   Explanation of  the Administration’s Fiscal Year   2017 Revenue Proposals 116  (Dept.   of  the Treasury, Feb.   2016).  147   T.R.C.   § 358(b)(1);   Reg.   § 1.858—2(a)(2)Q).  148 Even   without a reorganization,   similar   issues   are raised when shares are   sold by a  taxpayer   who acquired lots of  that   stock   on   different   dates or  at different prices.  See, e.g., Reg.  § 1.1012-1(c),   providing   that if the   shares sold cannot   be   adequately identified,   the   earliest   of  the lots acquired is deemed to be   sold first. In   the   reorganization setting,   the   cases   are  inconsistent.   Compare, e.g., Arrott v. Commissioner,   136   F.2d   449   (3d Cir. 1948)   (average   basis) and   Bloch v. Commissioner,   148   F.2d   452   (9th   Cir. 1945)   (tracing   permissible).  149   See   generally   Reg.   § 1.358-2.  439

On Date 3, Corporation Y acquires the assets  of Corporation X in a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A). Pursuant to the terms of the plan of reorganization, J receives   2 shares of Corporation Y stock for each   share of Corporation X stock. Therefore, J receives   60 shares of Corporation Y stock. Pursuant to Section 354, J recognizes no gain or loss on the exchange.   J is not   able to identify which shares of Corporation  Y stock are received for each   share of Corporation X stock. J  has 40 shares of Corporation Y each of which has a basis  of $1.50 and is treated as having   been   acquired on Date 1 and  20 shares of Corporation Y each of which has a basis of $3 and  is treated as having   been   acquired on Date 2. On or before   the date on which the   basis of a share of Corporation Y stock  received becomes relevant, J may designate which of the shares  of Corporation Y stock have a basis of $1.50 and   which   have a basis of $3.

See, e.g., Reg. § 1.358—2(c) Example 3. 151 Reg. § 1.358—2(a)(2)(i). These regulations also address the more   complex situation  where stock and securities (e.g., bonds) are received.

Treatment   of   the   Reorganization   Exchange.   Without   a  nonrecognition   provision,   the   target   corporation   in   an   acquisitive  reorganization   would   recognize   gain   or   loss   on   the   transfer   of its assets and   the   assumption   of its liabilities   by the   acquiring   corporation.   If the acquisition   qualifies   as   a reorganization,   however,   Section   361(a)   comes to the   rescue   by providing   that   the   target   recognizes   no   gain   or   loss   if it exchanges   property,   pursuant   to the reorganization   plan,   solely for stock or   ee   eee   which   also is a party   to the   reorganization.—  Section   seria cers similar protection byproviding thattheassumption  of the target’s   liabilities in a reorganization   exchange will not be treated  as   boot   nor   prevent   the   exchange   from   being   tax-free   under   Section 361(a).157 These   rules   apply   primarily   to Type   A   and   C reorganizations  and   forward   triangular   mergers.   In a Type B stock-for-stock   exchange   or a reverse   triangular   merger,   no   assets   are   transferred   because   the target  corporation   remains   intact   as   a   controlled   subsidiary   of the   acquiring  corporation.  The   target   in a Type   C reorganization   may   receive   a limited   amount of boot   without   disqualifying   the   transaction   under   Section   368.158   In  that   event,   the   target   must   recognize   any   realized   gain   (but   may   not recognize   loss)   on   the   reorganization   excha   tent   of the   cash and   the   fair market   value   of   the   boot   that   the   target   does   not   distribute pursuant to the plan of reo   ization.159 Any transfer by the   target of  154   Reg.   § 1.358—2(a)(2)(1i).  155   Id.  156   See   p. 437,   infra.  157 As in the   Section   351   incorporation area,   the general   nonrecognition rule in Section 357(a) is subject to an exception in Section   357(b) if the liability assumption is motivated   by tax avoidance or lacks a bona fide business   purpose.   The Section   357(c) exception for   liabilities  assumed in excess   of  the basis   of  the  transferred   assets   only applies to a Type   D reorganization. See   Chapter 11B, infra.  158 [.R.C. § 368(a)(2)(B). Boot in  a Type   C  reorganization   would   include   any   property   other than   voting   stock   of  the   acquiring   corporation (or  its parent).   See   Section   B3 of  this Chapter, infra.  159   T.R.C.   § 361(b)(1),   (2).

An   acquiring   corporation   that  a   .   TW  transfers   appreciated   boot property   to the target   a   artial consideration  for the   target’   st recognize   gain   under   Sectio   because, to that   extent,   the   transaction   is considered   to be   a taxable   exchange. 163  In that   event,   the target takes   the boot   property   with   a fair market   value  basis. 164  Treatment   of Distributions.   Section   361(c)   generally   provides   that   a corporation   does   not   recogmize   gain   or   loss   on   the   distribution   of  “qualified   property”   to   its   shareholders   pursuant   to   a   reorganization plan.   “Qualified   property”   is: (1) stock   (or rights   to   acquire   stock)   in, or obligations   (e.g., bonds   and   notes)   of the   distributing   corporation,   or   (2)  stock   (or rights   to acquire   stock)   in, or obligations   of, another   party   to the  reorganization   which   were   received   by the distributing   corporation   in the  exchange.   Thus,   any   stock,   securities   or   even   short-term   notes   of the  acquiring   corporation   received   by the   target   in   the   exchange   and   then  distributed   to   its   shareholders   would   constitute   “qualified   property.” Section   361(c)(3)   makes   it clear   that   a transfer   of “qualified   property”   by  a target   to its creditors   in satisfaction   of corporate   liabilities   is treated   as a “distribution”   pursuant   to the   reorganization   plan. If the   target   distributes   an   asset other than qualified property, it must recognize   gain (but may not recognize loss) in the Sam@-manner as  if the property had been sold to the distributee at its fair market value, 165  For example, the   target would   recognize   gain on the distribution of an  appreciated   retained asset (i.e., an   asset   not acquired in the  reorganization) or boot   (other than notes of the acquiring   corporation)  which   appreciated between the time it was received and the   distribution to shareholders. 166  Sales Prior to Liquidation.   Before   liquidating,   the  target corporation  in a Type   C reorganization may sell some of the   stock or securities  160 I.R.C. § 361(b)(3).

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS  received from the acquiring   corporation in order to raise money to pay off  creditors. Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the   courts were divided  over whether these sales were entitled to nonrecognition treatment.167  The current   version of Section   361 settles the debate by providing that  only transfers of “qualified property” (i.e., stock or obligations of the  acquiring Corporation) or boot directly to creditors will qualify for  nonrecognition   because they are treated as “distributions” to the  shareholders   pursuant   to the   reorganization   plan.!68   Sales   of property   to  third   parties   are   thus   fully taxable   events   even if they were necessary to  raise   money   to pay   off creditors. pean   iS esi iar EV ae   ama  Basis   and Holding   Period.   If the target   corporation   retains   property received   from   the acquiring   corporation,   which   only could   occur   in a Type C   reorganization   where   the   Commissioner   waives   the   Section  368(a)(2)(G)   distribution   requirement,   it is deemed   to   have   distributed  that   propert   its   shareholders,   who   then are treated   as having  recontributed   the property   to   a   “new”   ion   as   a   contribution to  capital.169 The basis and   the   holding   period   of the property   in the hands  of   the   “new”   corporation   depend   upon   the   consequences   to   the  shareholders.   If the property is boot to the shareholders,   it receives_a fair  market   value   basis   and   no   tacked   holding   period   in the   hands   of either  the   shareholders   or   the   “new” corporation to which   it is constructively  recontributed.17°   If the   property   is nonrecognition   property   (e.g., stock   or securities   of the   acquiring   corporation)   to   the shareholders,   then   their  exchanged   bases   and   tacked   holding   periods   transfer _to the   “new”  corporation.!171   These   rules   are   irrelevant   in   the   typical   Type   C  reorganization   where   the   target   liquidates   and   distributes   the   stock,  securities   and   boot   received   in the   transaction,   along   with   any   retained  assets,   to   its   shareholders.   In   that   event,   basis   and   holding   period   are determined   under   the   operative   provisions   governing   shareholders   and  security   holders.  3.

444   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  transaction.!72   To the extent   that   it may   issue   securities   as consideration  for   the   acquired   property,   the   acquiring   corporation   recognizes   no   gain  because   the   acquisition   is   a   “purchase.”   If the   acquiring   corporation transfers   other   “boot”   property   to   make   the   acquisition,   however,   it recognizes   any   realized   gain or loss under   general   tax   principles.173 Basis   and   Holding   Period:   In   General.   Under   Section   362(b),   the target   assets   acquired   in   a   Type   A,   Type   C   or   forward   triangular reorganization   take   a transferred   basis,   increased   by any   gain recognized  by the target   on the transfer.   Since   Section   361(a)   generally   provides   that  the   target   does   not   recognize   gain   or   loss   on   any   exchange   of property  pursuant   to the   plan   of reorganization,   an   upward   basis   adjustment   for  gain   recognized   by   the   target   will   occur   only   in   the   rare   Type   C reorganization   where   the   target   receives   boot   and   does   not   distribute   it to   its   shareholders   or   creditors.   In   the   case   of   a   Type   B   or   reverse triangular   reorganization,   however,   the   property   acquired   is corporate stock   whose   transferred   basis   is determined   by its basis   in the   hands   of  the   target   shareholders.   In either   case,   the   property   acquired   is allowed  a tacked   holding   period   under   Section   1223(2). The acquiring corporation in a Type B stock-for-stock exchange or reverse triangular merger often   faces some logistical challenges in determining its exchanged basis in the T stock, especially when T is  a  publicly traded company. Assume, for example, that P acquires all the  stock of publicly traded_T in a Type   B reorganization. P’s basis in its newly acquired T stock is the same as the aggregate basis of the former  T shareholders,   but how is P   supposed to acquire this information? For  many years,   the   IRS’s   position was that P should use its best efforts to  “survey” the surrendering T shareholders and, where that was  impractical, P could use   statistical sampling   and estimates.174 The   IRS  came to recognize that its procedures   had not kept pace with changes in  the   securities markets (e.g., most stocks are held by brokers   and custodians in   street name). Revenue Procedure   2011-35175 is the  culmination of several   years of study on this arcane   but   practically important issue. In   35 mind-numbing pages,   the IRS sets forth   four methodologies that   basically provide more modern survey, statistical  sampling   and estimating techniques for c ations  that  acquire stock  in transferred basis transactions. The   most reliable approach is  to survey  all T  share olders   but, when that is impractical,   the revenue   procedure  explains how to use   statistical sampling   and other   fallback techniques  173 See   Rev.   Rul. 72-827,   1972-2 C.B.   197.  174 Rev.   Proc.   81-70,   1981-2   C.B.   729.  175 2011-25 I.R.B.   890.

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS 445  and   permits the use of one or more of the prescribed methodologies in any combination.  Limit   on   Importation   of Built-in   Losses.   The   effect   of the   Section  362(b)   transferred   basis   rule is to preserve   not only built-in   gains but also built-in   losses   when   P   acquires   T’s   assets   in   a   tax-free   reorganization. This   rule   made   it possible   for U.S.   corporations   to engage   in what   became  known   as   “basis   shift”   transactions   with   U.S.   tax-indifferent   parties,  such   as   foreign   corporations.   The   primary   goal   was   to   shift   unrealized economic   losses   from   foreign   to   U.S.   taxpayers,   who   could   then   realize  the losses   and   shelter   their   taxable   income.  Section   362(e)(1)   attempts   to block   basis-shift   shelters   by providing  that   if a net   built-in   loss   is “imported”   in a tax-free   reorganization,   the basis   of such   loss   property   in the   hands   of the   transferee   corporation   is limited   to its fair   market   value   immediately   after   the   transaction.!7@   A  net   built-in   loss   is   imported   into   the   United   States   if the   aggregate  adjusted   basis   of   the   properties   received   by   a   domestic   transferee  corporation   from   a person   not   subject   to U.S.   tax   exceeds   the fair market  value   of the   transferred   properties.!77  Basis   of   Target   Stock   Received   in   Triangular   _Reorganizations.  Determining   the   acquiring   parent   corporation’s   basis   in   the   stock   of a subsidiary   acquired   in   a   reverse   triangular   reorganization   raises   a tantalizing   technical   question.   Under   Section   368(a)(2)(E),   the   acquiring corporation   either   may   form   a “phantom”   subsidiary   or use   a preexisting operating   subsidiary   to   merge   into   the   target   corporation.   It ordinarily  will transfer   voting   stock   and   possibly   some   boot   to the   subsidiary   which then   transfers   that   property   to   the   target   shareholders   as   the consideration   for the   acquisition. In a straight   Type   B reorganization,   the   parent   determines   its basis  in the target   stock under   Section   362(b)   by reference   to the _stock bases of  the   former   target   shareholders.   In   the   case   of   a   reverse   subsidiary  merger,   however,   Section   358   would   appear   to   require   the   acquiring corporation   to take   an   exchanged   basis—i.e.,   its basis   in the target   stock  acquired   would be the same as its   basis inthe stock of   the disappearing  subsidiary.   That   basis likely would   be zero   if a phantom   subsidiary   were used   to   effect   the   merger.   A   similar   issue   arises   in the   case   of forward triangular   merger,   where   the target   merges   into   a subsidiary   formed   by the   acquiring   corporation   immediately   prior to the reorganization.   Since the   parent   normally   forms   the   subsidiary   by transferring   its own   stock, ~in which it presumably   has a zero basis,   it would   appear that   the parent would retain a zero   basis   in   the   stock   of  the subsidiary   even after it  absorbs   the  target.  176 T.R.C. § 362(e)(2)(A).   For a similar   rule  limiting   the  transfer   of built-in   losses   in Section 351   transactions, see   I.R.C. § 362(e)(2),   discussed in Chapter 3A,   supra. 177, L.R.C. § 362(e)(1)(B),   (C). Regulations   help   identify   property   and   transactions   subject  to  the   anti-importation   rule   in  Section   362(e)(1)   and   elaborate   on   the   operation   of the   rule.   See  Reg.   §  1.862-3.

Each   T  Gian eaysited   On   Pav  OY Jean   ae isuxec  TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  The   Treasury   has   issued   regulations   that   address   the   zero   basis  problem.   Those   regulations   seek   to   conform   the   tax   consequences   of a  triangular   reorganization   with   those   of   a   “drop   down”   transaction   in which   P acquires   T’s   assets   or   stock   directly   and   then   drops   them   down  to a subsidiary   (“S”) in a tax-free   transaction.   To   illustrate   the   operation  of the regulations   in a forward   triangular   merger   in which   T merges   into  S, a newly   formed   P subsidiary,   the   regulations permit   P   to increase   its _ basis   in its S stock   by   the net basi   iabilities)   of T’s   ts.178  In a simple   transaction   where   P had   no   prior basis   in its S stock,   the   net  effect is that   P’s basis   in   i   stock   and   S’s basis   in the   acquire   assets  will be the same.  In a simple   reverse   triangular   merger   where   newly   formed   S merges into   T,   which   survives   as   a   P   subsidiary,   P’s   basis   in   i   stock   is  adjusted   by assumi   ed into   S in a forward   triangular  merger,   applying   the rules discussed   above.!79   Thus,   in a wholly   tax-free  reverse   merger   where   100   percent   of the   T stock   is acquired,   P’s basis   in  its T   stock   would   equal   T’s   net   basis   in its   assets   plus   any   preexisting  basis   that   P had   in its S stock.

Except for adding   Section   338   in  1982,   most   revisions  have   been   aimed   at  narrow   technical   problems.   In the   early   1980s,   the

448  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Senate   Finance   Committee   began   a comprehensive   study   of Subchapter C. The   staff reviewed   recommendations   of prominent   bar   and   accounting  groups   and   relied   heavily   on   the   Subchapter   C project   of the   American  Law   Institute.   In   September,   1983,   it issued   its   preliminary   report—a  controversial   document   that   proposed   changes   both   large   and   small. The   Finance   Committee   staff followed   up with   its “final report”—the  Subchapter   C Revision   Act   of 1985.   Some   of its recommendations   were  incorporated   in the   Tax   Reform   Act   of 1986.   But   even   the   1986   Act   left  for another   day the   centerpiece   of both   the ALI   and   the   Senate   Finance  Committee   projects—the   adoption   of an   entirely   new   scheme   governing corporate   acquisitions,   including   the   replacement   of   the   tax-free  reorganization   provisions   with   an   essentially   elective   system   that   would permit   nonrecognition   under   consistent   standards   for   any   corporate acquisition   at   the   price   of a   carryover   basis   in the   assets   of the   target corporation.   It has   now   been   over   40   years   since   the   ALI   proposal   was put   forth.   If Congress   ever   entertains   the   idea   of   reforming   the   tax  treatment   of corporate   acquisitions   (a dim   prospect),   this   idea   could   be  resurrected.   So   while   there   is little   expectation   that   the   current   regime will   be   changed   in   the   near   future,   it is worth   a   moment   to   consider  whether   there   is   a   better,   more   rational   alternative.   The   following  excerpt   provides   a summary   of these   acquisition   proposals.  Joint Committee on Taxation,   Present Law and  Background Relating to Selected Business   Tax Issues  (JCX—41—06), September 19, 2006. C. Issues Relating to Mergers and   Acquisitions In general  The different   rules permitting particular   corporate   transactions to  receive   tax-free treatment are varied and   frequently inconsistent.   In  some cases, more   than one rule could apply to the form of a particular corporate   transaction. The statute and _ the administrative pronouncements of the IRS over   the   years have   attempted to resolve  overlap situations and to provide guidance   regarding other   interpretive  issues.  The structure of present   law is in part a result   of the   historical development and   aggregation of provisions. The structure also   reflects  reactions to judicial decisions   interpreting   particular provisions, and  reflects   legislative developments establishing new rules and  accompanying concern   that   existing   provisions, if not   limited, might  conflict with or undermine the new rules.  The different, and often overlapping,   variations   within   the merger and   acquisition   rules   can   be  viewed as  a significant   source   of complexity  On   the other   hand,   these   rules,   as they   have   been   interpreted and  clarified   over   the years   through   administrative   pronouncements,   provide

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS  a large amount of taxpayer selectivity and certainty. Taxpayers are relatively assured of obtaining a specific tax result so long as the  transaction satisfies the   formalistic requirements of the chosen merger and acquisition provision. Moreover, comprehensive reform of these rules  and the imposition of consistency could not generally be accomplished without recommending fundamental changes in the tax   policy   reflected by one or another of the  provisions.  Discussion   of certain   proposals  Elective   carryover   basis for “qualified   acquisitions” An   approach   that   has   been   suggested   by a number   of commentators  in the   past   would   generally   permit   a corporation   to dispose   of a business for   any   type   of   consideration,   including   cash,   and   elect   to   pay   no  corporate   level   tax,   provided   the   consideration   received   is distributed   to  shareholders   and   that   they   pay   tax   (if they   are   taxable   shareholders)   on any   cash   or   other   consideration   that   is not   a   qualified   continuing   stock  interest.   The   acquiring   corporation   would   not   obtain   a   stepped-up   fair  market   value   basis   in the   acquired   corporate   assets   if the   election   were  made   not   to   pay   corporate   level   tax.   Only   certain   transactions   that  involved   the   acquisition   of a   significant   amount   of the   stock   of another  corporation   or   the   assets   of a   corporate   business   would   qualify   for this  election.  Such   a proposal   was   included   in a 1985   report   prepared   by the   Staff  of the   Senate   Committee   on   Finance.77   That   proposal   also included   other  conforming   changes   in its attempt   to substitute   a single   approach   for the present   law   varied   rules   affecting   tax-free   acquisitions.   For   example,   the proposal   would   have   conformed   the various   definitions   of “control”   under present   law   to the   definition   for filing a consolidated   return.  Another   version   of such   a proposal   was   presented   at, and   appears   in  the   report   of, an   invitational   conference   addressing   subchapter   C issues sponsored   by   the   American   Bar   Association   and   New   York   State   Bar Association   Tax   Sections   in   1987.78   An   earlier   proposal   of this   type   was made   by the American   Law   Institute.”9 This   type   of proposal   involves   a specific   policy choice   to abandon   the existing   statutory   requirements   for   continuity   of shareholder   interest.  The   proposal   would   exempt   a corporation   from   tax on a sale of its assets, even   if the   corporation   receives   cash   consideration   for the   transfer   of a  77 The   Subchapter   C Revision   Act of   1985, A Final Report   Prepared   by the Staff,  Committee on Finance,   United States   Senate, S.

450   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  business,   so long as the cash   is distributed   to shareholders   and   the assets  transferred   retain   a carryover   basis.  Several   policy   arguments   can   be   made   in   favor   of such   a   change. First, as long as assets   do not obtain   a stepped   up basis,   there   is corporate level   tax   in   the   future   as   the   recipient   corporation   earns   income   and  retains   the   low   basis   assets.   Second,   as   long   as   shareholders   pay   tax   on  any   cash   that   is received,   this   single   tax   is sufficient   as   a   current   tax. Third,   the   corporate   reorganization   provisions   are   complex   and   can   be manipulated;   and   an   explicit   election   would   simplify   corporate   tax  planning. Several   policy   arguments   can   also   be   made   against   such   a   change. When   assets   are   transferred   from   one   corporation   to   another   for   cash,  the transferring   corporation   is generally   taxed   on   gain   at the   time   of the transaction   or when   the cash   is received.   Payment   of tax   in the   future,   if the   recipient   corporation   pays   more   because   of a carryover   basis,   is not the economic   equivalent   of payment   of tax   at the   time   of the   transaction, but   is significantly   less   due   to the   time   value   of money.   Questions   may  arise   where   to   draw   the   line   that   would   allow   certain   transfers   of  corporate   assets,   such   as a transfer   of a   “business,”   to   be   exempt   from corporate   level   tax   while   other   transfers,   such   as   sales   in the   ordinary course   of business,   would   not   be so   exempt.   Interpretations   of the   line   so drawn   would   be   required.   In   addition,   proposals   for   such   restructuring  have   often   involved   new   sets   of   rules   such   as   rules   regarding   the definition   of control   or other   issues.   New   rules   could   also   involve   further  interpretation   and   could   lead   to new   uncertainty   and   complexity. Provide one set of  consideration and continuity rules for acquisitive reorganizations There   have   been a number of proposals to conform the consideration  rules for acquisitive reorganizations to require a specified percentage of  stock consideration (e.g., 50   percent) and to conform the   rules as   to  whether the   stock must be voting stock.80  One policy   issue   related to such recommendations is the  determination   what type of stock is counted in determining continuity  and for purposes of determining   whether   shareholders are taxed. For  example, one version of such a proposal   suggested that all stock would count   (thus eliminating a voting   stock requirement) but made an  exception for certain preferred stock   that is redeemable within five  years.81  The recommendations are typically made only for the reorganization rules contained in section   368. Frequently, no change is recommended to  the non-reorganization rules   relating to transfers to controlled 80 See, e.g., American   Bar   Association rec dati ite ee   tae 10n recommendation 1981-5,   107 ABA Repts.   559,   34  He ; eA: °  American   Bar   Association   recommendation   1981-5,   supra.

CHAPTER 9 ACQUISITIVE REORGANIZATIONS  corporations under section 351.82 Under this type of proposal, if the  rules  for non-reorganization transfers to controlled corporations under section  351 are not modified, then many of the same planning choices   that exist under present   law would continue to be available. Unless the rules of  section 351 are tightened to conform to the new 368 rules in cases that  resemble acquisitive reorganizations, it  is arguable that little general consistency would be accomplished.88 On the other hand, such a  modification that   limited the application of section 351   could   be viewed  as   a policy decision to tighten the rules relating to acquisitive  transactions.  82 The   American   Law Institute Proposals that   included a provision for elective carryover basis, described   above,   did   include a provision   overriding   section 351   for  certain   qualified  acquisitions. However, since   the   basic   proposal for qualified   acquisitions abandoned a  shareholder   continuity   of   interest requirement for   qualified   acquisitions, the   impact of  overriding   section   351   in  those   cases   was   confined to a much   narrower   range of issues. 88 Partnership   rules   also   could   continue to   offer   different   planning   approaches to  combining   businesses   and   assets   in  some   circumstances.  451

CHAPTER   10  CORPORATE   DIVISIONS  A.   INTRODUCTION 1.   TYPES   OF   CORPORATE   DIVISIONS  Code:   Skim   §§ 355;   368(a)(1)(D),   (c). The   preceding   chapter   examined   acquisitive   reorganizations.   We now   turn   to   a   variety   of   transactions   in   which   a   single   corporate enterprise   is divided   into   two   or   more   separate   corporations.   Section   355 allows   a corporation   to make   a   tax-free   distribution   to its shareholders   of  stock   and   securities   in one   or more   controlled   subsidiaries.   If an   intricate  set   of   statutory   and   judicial   requirements   are   met,   neither   the distributing   corporation   nor   its shareholders   recognize   gain or loss on the distribution.   Section   355   also   unlocks   the   gate   to other   provisions   which govern   the treatment   and   characterization   of boot,   and   collateral   matters  such   as   basis,   holding   period   and   carryover   of   tax   attributes.1   The rationale   for nonrecognition   is that   the   division   of a business   conducted  under   one   corporate   umbrella   into   separate   corporations   is   not   an  appropriate   taxable   event   when   no   significant   assets   leave   corporate  solution   and   the   historic   shareholders   continue   to   control   all   the  resulting   corporations.  The   three   types   of corporate   divisions   are   commonly   known   as   spin- offs,   split-offs   and   split-ups.   To   illustrate   the   elements   of   these  transactions,   assume   that   Alex   and   Bertha   each   own   50   percent   of the  stock   of Diverse   Corporation   (“D”),   which   for many   years   has   operated   a  winery   and   a   chicken   ranch   as   separate   divisions.   For   reasons   to   be  elaborated   below,   the   shareholders   wish   to divide   the businesses   into two separate   corporations   on   a   tax-free   basis.   The   division   method   they  choose   will be influenced   by their   nontax   goals.   The   possibilities   are:  (1) Spin-off. Assume that to comply with a new state  regulation, D is required to operate the chicken   ranch   and  winery as separate   corporations.   To   accomplish the  division, D forms a new corporation,   Poultry, Inc.,  contributing the   assets   of   the chicken   ranch. It then distributes   the stock  of Poultry pro rata to Alex   and   Bertha, who   emerge as equal   shareholders in each   corporation. Because a spin-off involves a distribution   of property to  shareholders.   without the surrender of   any stock, it  resembles   a dividend.  ote Th   or, eens  1 See, e.g., LR.C.   §§  356;   357;   358;   361;   362;   381;   1223(1)   and   Section   D of this   chapter,  infra.  453

--- Page 524 ---

454   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  (2)   Split-off.   Alex   and   Bertha   desire   to part company,   with Alex  operating   the winery   and Bertha   the chicken   ranch.   To help them   go   their   separate   ways,   D   again   forms   a   new  corporation,   Poultry,   Inc.,   contributing   the   assets   of   the  chicken   ranch.   D   then   distributes   the   stock   of Poultry   to  Bertha   in complete   redemption   of her D stock. Alex becomes  the   sole   shareholder   of D, which   now   owns   only the   winery,  and   Bertha   is the   sole   owner   of the   chicken   ranch.   If Alex  and   Bertha   did   not   want   to   part   company,   D   could   have  made   a pro   rata   distribution   of Poultry   stock   in redemption  of an   appropriate   amount   of D   stock.   In   either   situation,   a  split-off resembles   a redemption   because   the   shareholders  have   surrendered   stock   of D.  (3) Split-up. To comply with a new state regulation, D is  required to terminate its corporate   existence and divide up its two businesses. The fission is accomplished   by D forming Vineyard, Inc. and Poultry, Inc., contributing the winery  assets to Vineyard and the chicken ranch assets to Poultry.  D then distributes   the  stock of the two new corporations pro rata to Alex and   Bertha in exchange for all their D stock.  Because D has   distributed all of its assets and dissolved,  this transaction resembles a complete liquidation. If the objectives of the   parties had   been different (e.g., Alex and  Bertha wanted to sever their relationship),   the transaction  could have   been effected by distributing the Vineyard stock to Alex and the Poultry stock to Bertha.  As these examples   demonstrate, spin-offs, split-offs and split-ups can   be classified for tax purposes in two different ways: as   a tax-free  corporate division or   as the taxable   transaction that each method  resembles. In order to qualify as tax free to the shareholders, the division  must satisfy the requirements of Section   355 and its accompanying  judicial   doctrines.   In  general,   Section   355   allows a corporation   with one  or more   businesses that have been actively  conducted for five   seareon  more to make a tax-free distribution ~o e stock of a controlled subsidiary (or subsidiaries) provided that the tra ion j   1 ied  out  for a legitimate   business   purpose   and is not being used principally as  a device to bail out earnings and profits.  In the absence of Section   355, a  spinppiihkely wouldimesaiinea cen om under Section   301; a  split-  off would be  tested for dividend   equivalency   under the redemption rules in Section   302; anda split-up would be treated as   a complete liquidation  under   Section 331.  There is one more piece to  this introduction to the puzzle.   In  each of the examples above,   Diverse   Corporation   was   required to engage in a preliminary step   in   order to accomplish its division. Because its two businesses   were   operated as divisions   under   one   corporate   roof   rather than as separately   incorporated   subsidiaries,   D   had to drop   one   or more

--- Page 525 ---

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  of those businesses into a separate corporate shell before proceeding with  the distribution to its shareholders. If that distribution satisfies the tests  in Section 355, the initial transfer of assets by D to its new subsidiary (or  subsidiaries) will constitute a divisive Type D reorganization.2 As such,  the transfer of assets will be tax free to D under Section 361(a), the assumption of liabilities   will be governed   by Section 357 and the basis of the transferred assets will carry over to the new subsidiary under Section  362(b).3 Creation of a new subsidiary, however, is not a condition to  qualifying for nonrecognition of gain under Section 355. If its requirements are met, Section   355 applies to distributions of stock of  preexisting   corporations as well as to new subsidiaries   created solely to carry out the division.4  2.   NONTAX   MOTIVES   FOR   CORPORATE   DIVISIONS  Many   different   strategic   and   economic   considerations   can   lead   a  company   to the   decision   that   its business   should   be divided.   Some   of the  more   routine   motives   include   resolution   of   shareholder   disputes,  insulation   of one   business   from   the   risks   and   creditors   of another,   and  compliance   with   a regulatory   decree. In the   world   of publicly   traded   companies,   one   of the   most   common motives   for   a   division   is   the   desire   to   separate   the   distributing   and  controlled   corporations   so they each   can   devote   their   attention   to a single  line   of   business.   In the   parlance   of Wall   Street,   focusing   the   old and   new  corporations   on a single   business   allows   investors   to have   a “pure   play”  on   a   particular   industry.   For   example,   a   corporation   engaged   in   the transportation,   energy   and   real   estate   businesses   might   transfer   the  latter   two   businesses   to newly   formed   corporations   and   then   distribute  all   shares   of   the   new   entities   to   the   distributing   corporation’s shareholders   to   create   three   companies,   each   with   a   single   focus.   The theory   underlying   this   maneuver   is   that   a   more   narrowly   focused company   will   have   greater   success   than   a conglomerate   by virtue   of its ability to devote   more   energy   and   attention   to the   single enterprise.   This renewed   vigor,   so   the   theory   goes,   will   be   derived   in   part   from   an increased   incentive   for   corporate   managers   to   perform.   Because   their performance   (or   at   least   the   perception   of their   performance)   will   be reflected   more   directly   in the   stock   value   of a narrowly   focused   company than   in   the   stock   value   of a   conglomerate,   the   managers   will   be   more accountable   to   shareholders.   In   addition,   proponents   of   corporate divisions   expect   the   resulting   streamlined   companies   to benefit   from   the 2 ‘The   initial transaction also would qualify for nonrecognition   under Section   351,   but  Section   368(a)(1)(D)   and its accompanying operative   provisions   generally should take precedence   with   respect to various   collateral   tax consequences (e.g., carryover of tax  attributes  under   Section   381) if the   transfer   of  assets is followed   by a Section   355   distribution.

456   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  freedom   of corporate   managers   to pursue   growth   opportunities   that   they otherwise   would   feel constrained   to pursue. Another   common   motive   for   a   corporate   division   is   the   desire   to increase   market   r   iti   of   the   value   of   a   particular   business.  HcecdticSs oP GuBIE PAIGE eUccem eicieegers meena  believe   that   stock   market   analysts   fail to appreciate   the   collective   value  of   the   corporation’s   businesses.   To   overcome   this   problem,   corporate  managers   often   decide   to place   a particular   business   in an   independent company   in the   hope   that   “the   market”   will   recognize   the   value   of that  business   (and   perhaps   also   the   value   of the   distributing   corporation’s  remaining   businesses)   more   clearly.   Increased   recognition   of value,   it is  hoped,   will attract   more   capital for both   the old and   new   corporations   and increase   returns   to shareholders.   There   is evidence   to   support   the   view  that   a corporate   division   will lead to increased   recognition   of shareholder value.   Certain   studies   of   corporate   divisions   have   concluded   that, following   an   initial   period   of investor   uncertainty,   the   stocks   of both distributing   and   controlled   corporations   that   have   engaged   in a   spin-off generally   outperform   the   market.5   This   increase   in stock   value   may   be attributable   in part to the fact that,   following   a spin-off,   distributing   and controlled   corporations   frequently   are   seen   as   attractive   candidates   for a corporate   acquisition. Yet another agenda driving corporate divisions may be an acquiring  corporation’s need to raise cash to pay down debt incurred in making an  acquisition by selling off some of the,tarsets)UsNSTESER GRAIL  for a potential   target to better   position itself   for an acquisition by  shedding businesses that depress its value. Congress’s desire to curb deferral of corporate-level tax   in connection   with   these break-up acquisition   strategies has   contributed to much of the complexity of  Section 355.  Alternatives exist to achieve many of the   goals of a corporate  division. For example, a corporation   simply could sell the   assets of an  unwanted business.   Similarly, if the business is conducted   through a subsidiary,   the parent could sell the subsidiary’s stock. Because the selling corporation   generally is taxed on the sale and its shareholders are  taxed a second   time when the sale proceeds are distributed, however, a  sale   often is not   tax efficient. In   contrast,   the   parties to a properly  structured spin-off  incur no current tax and the   distributing   corporation might even   recoup its investment in a preexisting   subsidiary at  far   less of a tax cost than in a  sale. Before   the  controlled   corporation’s   shares are distributed,   the   controlled   corporation   can   declare and   pay a large  ® See, e.g., P.   Cusatic. J   Miles & R.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  dividend that likely will be eligible for the dividends received deduction  provided by Section 243.6 Another alternative is for a corporation to issue tracking stock  (sometimes referred to as alphabet or letter   stock). The issuer pays  dividends on tracking stock based on the performance of a particular division or subsidiary. The stock is listed and traded   separately   from the issuer's other   shares,   giving the illusion that there are shares  outstanding in two distinct corporations. In theory, tracking stock allows  for market recognition of the value of a business and provides incentives for corporate managers in the same way as a spin-off, but it allows the  issuing corporation to retain   control of the business in question. Issuing  tracking stock also does not involve the tax cost of a sale   of the business.  Tracking stock does not offer all the advantages of a spin-off, however, such as the ability to insulate one business   from potential liabilities  associated   with another. It also may give rise to undesirable  administrative   and political issues, such as the necessity of satisfying two distinct groups of shareholders.  3.   HISTORICAL   BACKGROUND   OF   SECTION   355  To   better   understand   the   technical   requirements   for   a   tax-free corporate   division,   it is helpful   to look   back   at the   historical   background of Section   355.   The   early income   tax   provisions   governing   spin-offs   were elegantly   simple   but   dangerously   naive.   Interpreted   literally,   they permitted   a   corporation   to   transfer   all or   part   of its   assets   to   a   newly formed   subsidiary   and   then   to make   a tax-free   distribution   of the   stock of that   subsidiary   to its shareholders   as part of a plan of reorganization.’ The   tax   avoidance   potential   of this blanket   exemption   from   the   dividend rules   was   enormous,   and   the   judiciary   swiftly   responded   by   curtailing the   use   of a spin-off   as   a bailout   device.   In Gregory   v.   Helvering,   which follows,   the   Supreme   Court   made   one   of its earliest   contributions   to the  common   law   of taxation’   and   paved   the   way   toward   the   enactment   of a comprehensive   statutory   solution   to the   problem   of corporate   divisions.  Gregory   v. Helvering  Supreme   Court   of the   United   States,   1935.  293   U.S.   465,   55 S.Ct.   266.  = MR.   JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered   the   opinion of  the   Court.  2 Petitioner in 1928 was the owner of all the stock  of United   Mortgage  Corporation. That corporation   held among its assets   1,000 shares   of  the  6 See Chapter 4A, supra. The distributing   corporation’s   dividends   received   deduction will be  disallowed if the   distributing   corporation   does   not   hold   the  controlled   corporation’s   stock for a sufficient   period of  time.

458   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Monitor   Securitie   ion.   For   the   sole   purpose   of   procuring   a  eee   Eis   al in order to sell them   for her individual  profit,   and,   at the   same   time,   diminish   the   amount   of income   tax   which  would   result   from   a   direct   transfer   by   way   of dividend,   she   sought   to  bring about   a “reorganization”   under   § 112(g)   of the Revenue   Act of 1928,  c. 852,   45   Stat.   791,   818,   set   forth   later   in this   opinion.   To   that   end,   she  caused   the   Averill   Corporation   to   be   organized   under   the   laws   of  Delaware   on   September   18, 1928.   Three   days   later,   the   United   Mortgage  Corporation   transferred   to   the   Averill   Corporation   the   1,000   shares   of  Monitor   stock,   for   which   all the   shares   of the   Averill   Corporation   were issued   to the   petitioner.   On   September   24,   the   Averill   Corporation   was  dissolved,   and   liquidated   by   distributing   all   its   assets,   namely,   the  Monitor   shares,   to the petitioner.   No   other   business   was   ever transacted,  or   intended   to be   transacted,   by that   company.   Petitioner   immediately  sold   the Monitor   shares   for   $133,333.33.   She   returned   for   taxation   as capital   net   gain   the   sum   of $76,007.88,   based   upon   an   apportioned   cost  of $57,325.45.   Further   details   are   unnecessary.   It is not   disputed   that   if the   interposition   of   the   so-called   reorganization   was _ ineffective, petitioner   became   liable   for   a   much   larger   tax   as   a   result   of   the  transaction.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, being of opinion that   the  reorganization attempted was   without   substance   and must be disregarded, held  that  petitioner was liable  for a tax as though the United  corporation had paid   her a dividend consisting of the amount realized from the sale   of the Monitor shares.   In a proceeding before   the Board of  Tax Appeals, that body rejected   the commissioner’s view   and   upheld that  of  petitioner. 27   B.T.A. 223. Upon a review of the latter decision, the circuit court of appeals   sustained the commissioner and   reversed the board, holding that there had   been no “reorganization”   within the  meaning of the  statute. 69 F.  (2d)  809. Petitioner applied to this court for a writ of certiorari, which the government, considering the question one of importance, did  not oppose. We granted the writ.  Section   112 of the Revenue Act of 1928 deals with the  subject of gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of property. Such gain or loss is   to be recognized in computing the tax, except as provided in that section. The provisions of the   section, so far as they are pertinent to the  question   here   presented, follow: “Sec.   112. (g) Distribution of  stock   on reorganization.—If there is distributed,   in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, to  a shareholder in a corporation a party to the reorganization, stock or securities   in such   corporation or in another   corporation  a party to the   reorganization,   without the surrender   by   such  shareholder of  stock or securities   in such a corporation,   no   gain  to the   distributee   from   the   receipt   of such   stock or securities  shall   be  recognized * * * |

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS   459  i te a: : ;  (i) Definition of reorganization.—As used in this section  Ta) fas tas  “(1) The term ‘reorganization’ means * * * (B) a transfer by a corporation of all or   a part of its assets to another   corporation  if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its  stockholders or both are in control of the corporation to which  the   assets are transferred, * * * .”  It is earnestly   contended   on   behalf   of the   taxpayer   that   since   every element   required   by the   foregoing   subdivision   (B) is to be found   in what  was   done,   a statutory   reorganization   was   effected;   and   that the motive of  the taxpayer   thereby   to escape   payment   of a tax will not   alter   the   result or   make   unlawful   what   the   statute   allows.   It   is   quite   true   that   if a reorganization   in reality   was   effected   within   the   meaning   of subdivision  (B), the   ulterior   purpose   mentioned   will   be   disregarded.   The   legal   right of a   taxpayer   to   decrease   the   amount   of what   otherwise   would   be   his taxes,   or altogether   avoid   them,   by means   which   the law   permits,   cannot be doubted.   * * * But   the question   for determination   is whether   what   was  done,   apart   from   the   tax   motive,   was   the   thing   which   the   statute  intended. The   reasoning   of the   court   below   in justification   of a negative  answer   leaves   little   to be   said.  When   subdivision   (B)   speaks   of   a   transfer   of   assets   by   one corporation   to another,   it means   a transfer   made   “in pursuance   of a plan  of reorganization” [§ 112(g)]   of corporate   business;   and   not   a transfer   of  assets   by one   corporation   to   another   in pursuance   of a   plan   having no relation   to the business of either,   as   plainly   is the   case   here.   Putting aside,   then,   the   question   of motive   in   respect   of taxation   altogether,   and fixing the character   of the proceeding   by what   actually   occurred,   what   do we   find?   Simply   an   operation   having   no   business   or corporate   purpose— a mere   device   which   put   on   the   form   of a corporate   reorganization   as   a disguise   for   concealing its real character,.and   the   sole   object   and accomplishment   of which   was   the   consummation   of a preconceived   plan,  not   to reorganize   a business   or   any   part   of a business,   but   to transfer   a  parcel   of corporate   shares   to the   petitioner.   No   doubt,   a new   and   valid  corporation   was   created.   But   that   corporation   was   nothing   more   than   a  contrivance   to the end last described.   It was   brought   into existence   for no other   purpose;   it performed,   as   it was   intended   from   the   beginning   it should   perform,   no   other   function.   When   that   limited   function   had   been exercised,   it immediately   was   put to death.  In   these   circumstances, the facts speak for themselves   and are  “susceptible of but   one   interpretation. The   whole   undertaking,   though  conducted   according to the terms of subdivision (B), was in   fact   an  elaborate   and   devious   form of conveyance masquerading as a corporate  reorganization, and  nothing   else.  The rule which   excludes   from  consideration   the   motive   of   tax   avoidance is not   pertinent to   the situation,   because   the   transaction   upon its   face   lies outside   the   plain  intent   of the   statute.   To   hold   otherwise   would   be   to   exalt   artifice   above

460  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  reality and to deprive the statutory   provision in question of all serious  purpose.  Judgment affirmed.  NOTE  The   Board   of Tax   Appeals   was   more   tolerant   in its evaluation   of Mrs.  Gregory’s   maneuver.   Adopting   a strict   constructionist   approach,   the   Board reasoned   that   “[a] statute   so   meticulously   drafted   must   be   interpreted   as   a literal   expression   of the   taxing   policy,   and   leaves   only   the   small   interstices  for judicial   consideration.”®   On   appeal   to the   Second   Circuit,   Judge   Learned Hand—in   one   of his most   famous   pronouncements   on   tax avoidance—agreed that   “[a]Jny one   may   so   arrange   his   affairs   that   his   taxes   shall   be   as   low   as  possible;   he   is not   bound   to   choose   that   pattern   which   will   best   pay   the Treasury;   there   is not   even   a patriotic   duty to increase   one’s   taxes.”!   But   he  quickly   eschewed   literalism   in favor   of the   big picture,   reasoning   that   “the  meaning   of a   sentence   may   be   more   than   that   of the   separate   words,   as   a  melody   is   more   than   the   notes,   and   no   degree   of particularity   can   ever obviate   recourse   to the setting in which   all appear,   and   which   all collectively create.”!1   The   Supreme   Court’s   opinion   was a less stylish but equally forceful  reaffirmation   that   the   language   of the   Code   must   be   interpreted   in light   of  its purpose.  Gregory v. Helvering has   ramifications that go far beyond corporate  divisions. It is one of the  earliest articulations of the substance over form   and  step transaction doctrines and paved the way to the   related economic  substance doctrine   that is now “codified” and accompanied by a steep penalty.12 However   amorphous they may be, those   doctrines serve as a  brooding omnipresence in the responsible tax advisor’s conscience. When the  system   works properly (not always the reality), they also thwart the schemes  of aggressive tax avoiders who rely  on a literal interpretation of the Code to  wreak havoc   with its intended purpose. As   we will   see later   in the   chapter,  the narrower business   purpose doctrine emanating from   Gregory also  survives as one of the major requirements for qualification as a tax-free  corporate division.13  While   Gregory   was   pending, Congress   saw the light and   repealed the tax-free   spin-off provision   involved in that case. Curiously, split-ups   (and, for a time, split-offs) continued to qualify for nonrecognition if they did  not run afoul   of the  limitations in Gregory.14 Congress ultimately realized, however,  that  not every spin-off is  a bailout   device, and in 1951 it enacted the statutory  forerunner of Section   355 to remove   any impediment to corporate divisions  Gregory v.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 461  “undertaken for legitimate business purposes.”!5 In general, the new statute  granted   nonrecognition to spin-offs that were pursuant to a plan of  reorganization unless one of the corporate parties to the reorganization did not intend “to continue the active conduct of a trade or business” or “the corporation whose stock is distributed was   used principally as   a device for the distribution of earnings   and profits * * * .”16 The contours of the present  Section   355   thus were   being   shaped: to qualify as tax free, a spin-off had to be motivated   by a genuine business purpose   and consist of the separation of  one or more active trades or businesses in a transaction that was not being  used principally as a bailout device. With   the   enactment   of Section   355   in the   1954   Code,   Congress   finally  provided   a   comprehensive   statutory   scheme   governing   all   three   types   of corporate   divisions.!7   At the   same   time,   the business   purpose   and   continuity of   interest   doctrines   were   preserved   as   independent   nonstatutory  requirements.  4.   OVERVIEW   OF SECTION   355  Code:   §§ 355(a)-(c);   368(c). Regulations:   § 1.855—1(b).  Before   becoming   immersed   in   technical   details,   it is important   to  recall   the   purpose   of Section_-355.   Congress   intended   to provide   tax-free  status   to   corporate   divisions   serving   legitimate   business   needs.   At   the  same   tinie, it   included   safeguards   to   patrol   against   the   bailout   of earnings   and   profits.   A more   recent   Congressional   concern   has   been   to prevent   taxpayers   from   using   divisions   to avoid   corporate-level   gain   on transactions   that are   more   akin   to sales than   mere   changes   in form.   Most  of the   statutory   and   judicial   requirements   are   directed   at   these   broad objectives.   But   their   precise   meaning   and   scope   are   not   always   clear, and the   waters   have   been   muddied   further   by piecemeal   changes   made   over  the   years   to address   real   and   perceived   abuses.  a.   STATUTORY   AND   JUDICIAL   REQUIREMENTS  A corporate   division   will   qualify   as   tax   free   to the   shareholders   and  the   distributing   corporation   if it satisfies   the   requirements   discussed below. Control. One corporation (the “distributing   corporation,” or “D”) must distribute to   its shareholders (with   respect to their   stock) or   to  security   holders (in exchange for their   securities)   the   stock or securities  _ of a corporation that D “controls” immediately before   the  distribution   (the  15S, Rep.

The  different   forms   continue   to  be significant   if  the  transaction fails  the Section   355   tests.

D must   distribute   all the stock or   securities   of   C   that   it holds   or,   alternatively,   an   amount   of   stock  sufficient   to constitute   “control”   within   the   meaning   of Section   368(c).19  If any   stock   or   securities   of C are   retained,   D   also   must   establish   to the  satisfaction   of the   Service   that   the   retention   is not   pursuant   to   a   plan  having   tax   avoidance   as   one   of its principal   purposes.2° Active   Trade   or   Business   Requirement.   Immediately   after   the  distribution,   both   D   and   C—or   in   a   split-up,   each   controlled  corporation—must   be   engaged   in,   or   treated   as   engaged   (through   a  subsidiary)   in,   a   trade   or   business   that   has   been   actively   conducted  throughout   the   five-year   period   ending   on   the   date   of the   distribution.21 That   business   must   not   have   been   acquired   within   the   five-year predistribution   period   in   a   transaction   in   which   gain   or   loss   was  recognized   in whole   or in part   (e.g., a sale of assets   taxable   to the seller).22 Moreover,   the   distributing   corporation   must   not   have   purchased   a  controlling   stock   interest   in   a corporation   conducting   the   business   in   a taxable   transaction   during   the   five-year   predistribution   period.23   In  applying   these   rules,   all   members   of D’s   and   C’s   “separated   affiliated group”   (generally,   subsidiaries   in which   the   parent   owns   80   percent   of  the voting   power   and   total   value)   are   treated   as   one   corporation.24 Not A “Device.” The division must not be used “principally as a device  for the distribution” of the earnings   and profits   of either D or C.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  the   division maintain   adequate continuity of interest in D and C, and  continuity of business enterprise is maintained after the   distribution.27 All these requirements are applied without   regard to the form the parties choose to accomplish the division. Thus, a distribution may  qualify as tax-free under Section   355 irrespective of whether it is pro  rata and whether or not the distributee shareholder   surrenders stock in the  distributing corporation or the distribution is preceded by the formation of a new controlled corporation in a Type D reorganization.28 This   list   of basic   Section   355   requirements   do   not   tell   the   entire  story.   Several   other   specialized   provisions   may   cause   an   attempted  corporate   division   to   be   disqualified29   or   D   to   recognize   gain   on   its  distribution   of C stock   even   though   D’s   shareholders   qualify   for tax-free treatment.30  b.   TAXATION   OF   THE   PARTIES  Section   355   provides   total   shareholder-level   nonrecognition   only where   the   distributing   corporation   distributes   stock   or   securities   of a controlled   corporation.3!   Stock   rights   or   warrants   are   not   treated   as “stock   or   securities”   for   this   purpose.?2   In   the   case   of a   distribution   of securities   (e.g.,   long-term   notes,   bonds,   debentures),   if the   principal amount   iti   corporation   received   by   the distributee   exceeds   the principal   amount   of the distributing   corporation’s  securities surrendered   in   connection   with the distribution, the value of  the   €xcess   is   t.33 If securities   of the   controlled   corporation  are   received   and   no   securities   of the   parent   are surrendered, the   entire  value   of the securities   received   is treated   as boot.34 In addition,   any   stock  of a controlled   corporation   acquired   in a taxable   transaction   within the  five years   preceding the distribution—which   we will come   to know   as “hot  stock”—constitutes   beot.35 The distribution of boot   does   not   necessarily  disqualify   a   transaction   under   Section   355,   but   it   will   cause   the distributee   shareholder   to   recognize   any   realized   gain,   usually   as   a qualified   dividend   taxable   at   preferential   capital   gains   rates,   to   the  27   Reg.   § 1.855—2(c),   —1(b).  28   LR.C. § 355(a)(2).  29 See, e.g., ILR.C. § 355(h),   restricting   tax-free   spin-offs involving real estate investment trusts.  30   See   Section   E of this chapter,   infra.  31 J.R.C. § 355(a)(1). For this purpose,   “nonqualified   preferred stock,” as defined in section 351(g)(2), received in a distribution   with   respect to stock other   than   nonqualified   preferred   stock is not   treated as “stock or securities”—i.e., it will be boot.

464   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  extent   of the   boot   received.36   At   the   corporate   level,   the   distributing  corporation   generally   does not recognize gain on the distribution of   stock  or securities   of its subsidiary but may   recognize   gain on the distribution  of appreciated   boot   or   in certain   situations   where   a divisive   transaction is used   to facilitate   the   sale   of a subsidiary.37  The   principal   hurdles   to achieving   nonrecognition   under   Section   355  are   the   active   trade   or business   and   business   purpose   requirements   and  the   “device”   limitation.   The   government’s   interpretation   of these   tests has   evolved   over   the   years   and   currently   is   reflected   in   extensive  regulations,   which   have   largely   supplanted   the   case   law   and   are   a  principal   focus   of this   chapter.  c.   ADVANCE   RULINGS  Under an IRS pilot program, a taxpayer may request a ruling addressing whether a transaction, as a whole, qualifies under Section  355.38 In   addition, a taxpayer may request a ruling on one or more “significant   issues” presented in a Section 355 transaction.39 An issue  generally is “significant” if  it is “a germane and specific issue of law,”  provided that in a ruling “the conclusion ... otherwise would not be essentially free from doubt.”40 The   IRS also has policies   on when it will  rule on   specific issues related to a Section   355   transaction. For example, generally a ruling may not be obtained on whether the distribution of the  controlled corporation is being carried out for one or more   business purposes or whether the transaction is used principally as   a device, unless the   issue is  a legal   issue and not inherently factual in nature.41 The   IRS   continues to study its policies   on providing rulings in corporate  transactions, including those under Section 355. Thus, the expectation  should be  that   the current   guidelines may change in the   future.42  B. THE   ACTIVE TRADE OR BUSINESS REQUIREMENT  Code: § 355(a)(1)(C), (b)(1), (2), (3)(A) & (B).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 465  Lockwood’s   Estate   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Eighth   Circuit,   1965.  350   F.2d   712.  mw VOGEL,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE.  The single question involved in  this review of an unreported decision  of the Tax Court of the United States, entered August 26, 1964, is  whether the “spin-off” of part of the business conducted   by the Lockwood  Grader Corporation of Gering, Nebraska, (hereinafter Lockwood)  through the organization of a new corporation, Lockwood Graders of  aine,   Inc.   (hereinafter   Maine,   Inc.)   was   tax-free   _to   petitioners,  recipients   of   the   stock   of   Maine,   Inc., “under   26 U.S.C.A.   Salat  (Int.Rev.Code).   The   government   contended   that   the   spin-off was   not   tax-  free   since   the requirements   of § 355(b)(2)(B)   relating   to the conducting   of an   active   business   for five years   prior   to the   date   of distribution   had   not been   met.   The   government   apparently   conceded   and   the Tax   Court   found  that   the   petitioners   had   met   all   other   requirements   to   qualify   under  § 355   for   tax-free   treatment.   The   Tax   Court   upheld   the   government’s contention   and   petitioners   appeal.  The   now   deceased   Thorval   J. Lockwood,   * * * and   his   wife Margaret  were   the   sole   stockholders   of   Lockwood and   had   been   so   since   its  incorporation   under   Nebraska   law   in   1946.   Lockwood’s   predecessor,  Lockwood   Graders,   was   a partnership   formed   in 1935   for the   purpose   of  producing   and selling a portable   potato sorting machine   invented   by the  decedent.   Starting   in the early   spring   of each   year   Thorval   and   Margaret drove   to Alabama   and   worked   their way   north   through   Missouri   to North Dakota   for the purpose   of selling Lockwood   products.   The   equipment   was  sold in “all of the potato   growing   areas   of the United   States”   but primarily  in the biggest   growing   areas   such   as North   Dakota,   Idaho   and   Colorado.  From   1946   to   1951,   inclusive,   Lockwood   operated   its   business   of  manufacturing   and   selling   wash   lines,   potato   machinery,   parts_and  supplies—to—potato   shippérs in the   potato   growing   areas.   Though  Lockwood   continued   to have   its   principal   place   of business   at   Gering, Nebraska,   branches   were   opened,   as   the   business   expanded,   in   Grand  Forks,   North   Dakota;   Antigo,   Wisconsin;   Monte   Vista,   Colorado;   and  Rupert,   Idaho.   These   branches   performed   both   manufacturing   and   sales  functions.   In   1952,   under   a   reorganization plan, these   branches   were —  separately   incorporated   to   promote   greater   efficiency   and   to   properly provide   for expansion.   Assets   of Lockwood   were   exchanged   for all of the  _stock   of each   new   corporation   and   the   stock   so   exchanged   was   passed  without   consideration   to   Thorval   and Margaret-as-sele-steckholders of Lockwood.   The   reorganization   plan,   among   other   things,   was   specifically  designed   to make   use   of the   tax-free   provisions   of what   is now   § 355.  In the   early   1950’s Lockwood   and   the   other   controlled   corporations changed   the   nature   of their   business   somewhat   by selling   to individual  farmers   as  well  as to  potato   suppliers. rs-as-well as   to potato suppliers.   Lockwood   had   previously   dealt

466   TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS   PART 2  primarily   in grading   equipment   but   at this   time   it began   to manufacture  and   sell field equipment   such   as   harvesting   pieces,   bin holders   and   vine  beaters   as   well.  Beginning   as   early   as   1947   Lockwood   began   to make   some   sporadic  and   relatively   inconsequential   sales   in   the   northeastern   part   of   the United   States.   From   1949   to 1955   the primary   sales   of products   and parts  in that   part   of the   country   were   made   to Gould   &   Smith,   Inc.,   a retailer  of farming   and   industrial   equipment,   of Presque   Isle,   Maine   (although  there   are   no   records   of sales   made   to   them   in   1952).   Such   sales   were  found   to be of a relatively   small   volume   by the   Tax   Court.   On   November  15,   1954,   Lockwood   established   a   branch   office   in   Presque   Isle,   Maine,  from   which   to handle   Lockwood   products.   On   March   1, 1956,   pursuant   to the   1951   plan   for   reorganization,   the   Maine   branch   office   was incorporated   under   the laws   of Maine   with   its principal   place   of business at   Presque   Isle,   Maine.   Maine,   Inc.,   was   a   wholly   owned   subsidiary   of  Lockwood.   On   incorporating,   Lockwood   transferred to Maine,   Inc.,  $23,500 in   assets   consisting   of   petty   cash   totalling   $150.00,   accounts  receivable   totalling $4,686.67,   automobiles   and trucks   worth   $1,100,  shop   equipment   worth   $295.00,   office   furniture   and   fixtures   worth  $81.60,   and   inventory   worth   $17,186.73.   In   return   for   these   assets Maine,   Inc.,   issued   all of its   stock,   235   shares   at   $100.00   par   value, to  Lockwood. On March 31, 1956, Lockwood   distributed   162 of these   shares  of Maine,   Inc., to Thorval and 73 of them   to Margaret.   This   distribution  gave   rise to the controversy   hereinvolved.”   ~  The   Tax Court held this distribution to be outside of § 355. According to the Tax Court there   was:  “* * * the absence of evidence that   the Maine business was  actively conducted   during the months   between March 31, 1951,  and August 1953—a span of time totaling   over 40 per cent of the  requisite   five-year   period   [required by   § 355(b)(2)(B).]” (Emphasis   supplied.)  The   Tax   Court   found   that   the   Maine   business   was   not   actively   and continuously   conducted   until   August   1953,   at   which   time   a   Lockwood  salesman   traveled   to Maine   and   personally   solicited   orders   from   farmers  and businessmen   other than   Gould   & Smith.   We   do not   disagree   with   the  factual   finding   of the   Tax   Court   as   to the   active   conduct   of Lockwood’s  business   in Maine   prior to the incorporation   of Maine,   Inc.   However,   the  Tax   Court,   for reasons   set out below,   erred   in looking dnly at the business performed   by   Lockwood   in   Maine   to   determine   if the   five-year   active  business   requirement   had   been   met   prior   to the   incorporation   of Maine,  Inc. Nothing   in the language   of § 355 suggests   that prior business   activity  Is on’y"toDe_measured_by looking at   thebusiness performed ina geographical   area   where   the controlled   corporation   is eventually   formed. In this   case,   when   the   entire   Lockwoo   ma   Is   viewed,   it   can   be seen that   Lockwood   was   engaged   in active   business   as   required   by § 355   for the   five   years   prior   to   the   incorporation   of   Maine,   Inc.   Since   its

--- Page 537 ---

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  incorporation Maine, Inc., has carried on the same kind of manufacturing  and selling business previously and concurrently performed   by Lockwood.   Thus all § 355   prerequisites are met   and the Tax Court erred in determining this was not a tax-free   transfer. At this point it would be  helpful to look at the evolvement of what is now § 355. Prior to 1924 a distribution to stockholders pursuant to a spin- off was taxed as   a dividend. From 1924 to 1932, however, the revenue  acts changed position and   provided spin-offs could  be tax-free. From 1934  to 1950 tax-free spin-offs were   again   abolished since this device was  being   used as   a method for distributing earnings   and profits, which  would otherwise be   taxable   dividends, through the issuance of stock in  the   controlled   corporation. Such stock could   be disposed of at the more favorable capital gain rates. Because of the usefulness of the spin-off device in the achievement of corporate growth and flexibility, Congress  again   accorded it tax-free   status in 1951. At that time certain conditions were imposed to prevent   any   abuse   from   using this device. In 1954 the  tax-free   spin-off was   continued as § 355 of the Code with additional tax  avoidance   safeguards   which included the   five-year active business requirement involved in  this case.  As   stated   by the   Second   Circuit   in Bonsall   v.   Commissioner,   2 Cir., 1963,   317   F.2d   61, at page   65:  “***   Only   long   application   may   completely   clarify   the difficult   terminology   of section   355.”  With   this   we   agree.   However,   certain   things   have   become   clear   since   the  enactment   of   § 355   in   1954.   After   much   controversy   it   has   been determined   that   tax-free   treatment   will   not   be   denied   to   a transaction  under   § 355   merely   because   it represents   an   attempt   to   divide   a   single  trade   or business.   See   United   States   v. Marett,   5 Cir.,   1963,   325   F.2d   28; Coady   v.   Commissioner,   33   T.C.   771,   affirmed   per   curiam,   6 Cir.,   1961,  289   F.2d   490.   The   Commissioner   has   acceded   to the   holdings   of Marett  and   Coady   in Rev.Rule   64-147,   1964-1,   Cum.Bull.   136,   even   though   the  Commissioner   had   previously   insisted,   in § 1.3855—1(a)   of the Income   Tax Regulations,   that   two   or   more   existing   businesses   had   to   be   actively operated   the five years   prior to distribution.  K*RK*  Respondent   in   the   instant   case,   although   claiming   to   accept   the single   business   interpretation,   points   to the   language   of § 355(b)(1)   and  argues,   as   did   the   government   in   Coady,   that   the   word   “and”   in   that “section means that,   in determining   whether or not   the   active business requirement   was   met,   one   has to look at both   the business   done   by the distributing   corporation   (Lockwood)   and the  business   done as such  by the  controlled   corporation   (Maine, Inc.) and its predecessors in Maine. Contrary to  the   government's position,   once it has   been   ascertained   that  two or  more  trades or businesses   are not  required  for  §-355-to  apply,  the  crucial   question   becomes   whether or   not   the   two   corporations   existin  467

468  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  after distribution are doing the same type of work and using the same  twie of assela provieusly=domeuand Aisedbyathe: posing aleat sGa  busmess. § 355(b)(1) has no relevance to respondent’s point   once it has  been determined that only a single business is required.  Here   the   five   years   of prior   activity   we   are   concerned   with   involve  the   prior   overall   activity   of Lockwood.   Previous   to   1956   Lockwood   had  carried   on   in toto   what   Maine,   Inc.,   would   later   carry   on   in   part   in the  northeast.   We   are   not   concerned   with   the   prior   activity   of Lockwood   in  the   northeast   only,   for   Congress   has   never   intimated   that   such   a geographical   test   should   be applied   and   we   are   not   about   to apply   such   a  test   now.   A   perusal   of   the   House   and   Senate   Reports   indicates conclusively   that   at no   time   did the House   or the Senate   contemplate   any kind   of   geographic   test   in   applying   the   five-year   active   business  requirement.   The   facts   clearly   show   that   Lockwood,   in fact,   was   actively  conducting   the   trade   or   business   involved   five   years   prior   to   the  distribution   period.  One   case,   Patricia   W.   Burke   v.   Commissioner,   1964,   42   T.C.   1021,  did   discuss   the   past   business   of a controlled   corporation   as   performed   in  a limited   geographical   area   in finding   the prerequisites   of § 355   had   been  met.   That   case   did   not,   however,   hold   that   there   was   in   fact   a  geographical   test.   Further,   at   page   1028   that   court   set   out   what   we believe   to be the test:  “*** as long as the business which is divided   has been  actively conducted for 5  years   before   the distribution and the  resulting businesses are actively conducted after the   division, the active business requirements of the   statute are met. Cf. also H. Grady Lester,   40 T.C. 947 (1963).” Since   there is no Congressional intent evidenced to the contrary,   the test,  restated, is not whether active business had   been carried out in the  geographic area later served by the controlled corporation but, simply, whether the distributing   corporation, for five years prior to distribution  had   been actively conducting the   type of business now   performed   by the  contr ion without   reference to the geographic area. In   the instant case   the facts   are abundantly clear   that Lockwood had   been actively engaged in the   type of business later carried on by  Maine, Inc., if one   refers to  a national   rather   than just the northeastern   market.  It was mentioned earlier   in   this opinion   that beginning in 1950 Lockwood   began to   sell field equipment as well as grading   equipment.  The   respondent   apparently does   not contend, nor   do   we find, that Lockwood so changed its business as   to be engaged in a new   business  that   had   been active for only   two   years   prior to the incorporation of  Maine, Inc. Lockwood   meets the requirements of  an   existing   five-year  active business as   set   out by the Conference   Committee in Conference  Report   No.   2543 at page   5298 of  3  U.S.C.Cong.   & Adm.News, 1954:

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 469  “It is the understanding of the managers on the  part of the  House, in agreeing to the active business requirements of  section 355 and of section 346 (defining partial   liquidations), that a trade or business which has been actively conducted throughout the 5-year   period   described in such sections will  meet the requirements of such sections, even though such trade or business underwent change during such 5-year period, for  example, by the addition of new, or the dropping of old, products, changes in production capacity, and the like, provided the  changes are not of such a character as   to constitute the  acquisition of a new or different business.” (Emphasis supplied.) In   § 1.355—4(b)(3)   of   the   Income   Tax   Regulations   the   Commissioner specifically   adopts   the   above-quoted   portion   of the   Committee   Report.  The   respondent   contends:  “If the   taxpayers’   argument   prevails,   then   any   corporation with   a   five-year   history   could   distribute   any   of   its   assets  regardless   of when   they   were   acquired   and   regardless   of what kind   of business   they   are   in   after   the   division,   as   long   as   the  distributing   corporation   is in an   active   business.   In other   words, taxpayer   argues   that   the   five-year   history   rule   requires   that only the business   of the distributing   corporation   have   a five-year history.   For   instance,   suppose   a   large   manufacturing corporation   with   a ten-year   life acquired   some   data   processing machines   in   order   to better   control   its   inventory   and   work-in-  process   flow.   If taxpayers’   argument   is correct,   a year   later   this  corporation   could   transfer   all the   data   processing   equipment   to a   new   corporation   in   exchange   for   its   stock,   spin   off the   stock  and   claim   a   tax-free   distribution   under   Section   355   since   the manufacturing   corporation   had   more   than a   five-year   life   and  the   data   processing   business,   once   an   integral   part   of   the  original   business,   was   being   actively   conducted   after   the   spin- off.   Moreover,   the   same   logic   would   allow   the   spin-off   of real estate   owned   by the   manufacturing   corporation   and   used   in its  business.”  The fears   of   the government are unfounded.   The   example of   the manufacturing   company is more closely akin to the Bonsall case, supra, and is factually distinguishable   from the   instant case. Here Lockwood had not   just  recently   acquired that   part or segment of its business that  was   spun off. Rather, what   was   spun off was a part of  the business  Lockwood had   always   performed in  the   past   and   which it has   continued to perform since   the   distribution. If Lockwood had,   just   before distribution,   acquired or opened   up a new or entirely   different   aspect   of  its business   unrelated to prior   activities and   had   spun this   off to the  controlled   corporation, a   different   result might   ensue.   In   Bonsall   the distributing   company, a dealer   in  floor   covering   materials,   attempted to  assert   a  tax-free   spin-off  occurred   when  a rental   business   of de   minimis

--- Page 540 ---

470  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  proportions   was   transferred to   a subsidiary   with the   stock of the  subsidiary   being distributed to the   distributor’s shareholders. * * * [I]t is clear that in respondent’s example and in Bonsall the business sought to be spun off was not actively engaged in for  five years prior to distribution, which is not the situation in the instant case. Here, what was spun off was merely an integral   part of what had   been Lockwood’s   primary and  only business   from its inception.  Further,   it should   be   remembered   that   even   if the   five-year   active  business   requirement   is met,   there   is further   protection   in § 355   against  spin-offs   being   used   for mere   tax   avoidance,   which   would   be   contrary   to Congressional   intent.   § 355(a)(1)(B)   will   only   allow   a   tax-free   spin-off  transaction   where   “*   * * the   transaction   was   not   used   principally   as   a device   for the   distribution   of the   earnings   and   profits   of the   distributing corporation   or   the   controlled   corporation   or   both   ***   .” Under   this  section,   the government   and   the courts   have   great latitude   in preventing  the   abuses   which   the   respondent   fears   will   happen   by   finding   for  petitioners   in this   case.   Cf.   Gregory   v. Helvering,   1935,   293   U.S.   465,   55  S.Ct.   266,   79 L.Ed.   596.   Herein   the   respondent   does   not   contend   that   the  purpose   of the   spin   off was   designed   primarily   for   tax   avoidance.   No  earnings   and   profits   were   in fact   distributed   to Thorval   and   Margaret. The   Tax   Court   stated   that:  “*** we do not view the distribution as running afoul of  the congressional   purpose   behind section   355, * * * .” This being so, and since petitioners otherwise   complied with § 355,   the  decision of the Tax Court will be   reversed. The transaction   herein  involved cannot be  treated as a taxable   distribution of dividends.  Revenue Ruling   2003-38  2003-1   Cum.   Bull.   811.  ISSUE  Whether the creation by a corporation engaged in the retail shoe  store business of  an Internet web site on which the corporation will sell  shoes at   retail constitutes an expansion of the corporation’s business  rather  than the  acquisition of a new or different business under § 1.355—  3(b)(3)(ii) of the Income Tax Regulations. CS  FACTS Corporation D has   operated a retail shoe store business, under the  name “D,”   since Year 1 in a manner that meets the requirements of § 355(b)   of  the   Internal Revenue Code. D’s   sales   are made exclusively to customers   who frequent its retail   stores   in shopping   malls   and   other locations.   D’s business   enjoys   favorable name recognition, customer loyalty, and   other   elements of  goodwill   in  the  retail shoe   market.   In  Year 8, D creates   an   Internet   web site and   begins   selling   shoes at retail   on   the  web site. To a  significant   extent,   the  operation   of  the  web site draws   upon

--- Page 541 ---

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS   471  D’s experience   and know-how. The web site is named “D.com” to take  advantage of the name recognition, customer loyalty, and other elements  of goodwill   associated   with D and the D   name and to enhance the web  site’s chances for success in its initial stages. In Year 10, D transfers all  of the web site’s assets and liabilities to corporation C, a newly formed,  wholly owned subsidiary of D, and distributes the   stock of C pro   rata to D’s shareholders. Apart from the   issue of whether the web site is considered an expansion of D’s business and therefore entitled to share  the business’s five-year   history at the time of the distribution in Year 10, the distribution meets all the requirements of § 355.  LAW  Section   355(a)   provides   that   a corporation   may   distribute   stock   and  securities   in   a   controlled   corporation   to   its   shareholders   and   security holders   in a transaction   that   will   not   cause   the   distributees   to recognize gain   or   loss,   provided   that,   among   other   requirements,   (i) each   of the distributing   corporation   and   controlled   corporation   is   engaged,  immediately   after   the   distribution,   in the   active conduct-of_a trade   or VS   >  business,   (ii)   each   trade   or   business   has   been   actively_conducted  throughout   the   five-year-period   ending   on   the   date   of the   distribution,  and   (111) neither   trade   or business   was   acquired   in a transaction   in which  gain   or   loss   was   recognized, in whole or in part,   within   the   five-year  period.   Sections 355(b)(1)(A), 355(b)(2)(B),   and 355(b)(2)(C).  In   determining   whether   an   active   trade   or   business   has   been  conducted   by a corporation   throughout   the five-year   period   preceding   the  distribution,   the   fact that a trade   or business   underwent   change   during  the   five-year period (for-example,   by the   addition   of new   or the   dropping  of old   products,   changes   in   production   capacity,   and   the   like)   shall   be  disregarded,   provided   that   the   changes   are   not   of such   a character   as   to  constitute   the   acquisition   of a   new   or   different   business.   Section   1.355—  3(b)(3) (ii).   In particular,   if a corporation   engaged   in the   active   conduct   of  one   trade   or business   during   that   five-year   period   purchased,   created,   or  otherwise   acquired   another   trade   or   business   in   the   same   line   of  business,   then   the   acquisition   of that   other   business   is ordinarily   treated  as   an   expansion   of the   original   business,   all of which   is treated   as   having  been   actively   conducted   during   that   five-year   period,   unless   that  purchase,   creation,   or other   acquisition   effects   a change   of such   character  as   to constitute   the   acquisition   of a new   or   different   business.   Id.  In Example (7) of § 1.355-8(c), corporation X had owned and  _ operated a department store   in the downtown area   of  the   City of G for six  years   before   acquiring a parcel of land in a suburban area   of G and  constructing a new   department store. Three   years after   the  construction,  X transferred   the suburban store and   related   business   assets to new  subsidiary Y   and   distributed   the Y stock to   X’s shareholders.   Citing  § 1.355-3(b)(3)(i)   and (ii), the example   concludes   that X.and   Y both satisfy the   requirements   of § 355(b).

472  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  In   Example   (8)   of   § 1.355—3(c),   corporation   X   had   owned   and  operated   hardware   stores   in   several   states   for   four   years   before purchasing   the   assets   of a hardware   store   in State   M   where   X   had   not previously   conducted   business.   Two   years   after   the   purchase,   X transferred   the   State   M   store   and   related   business   assets   to   new subsidiary   Y   and   distributed   the   Y   stock   to   X’s   shareholders.   Citing  § 1.355—-3(b)(3)(i)   and   (ii),   the   example   concludes   that   X   and   Y   both satisfy   the   requirements   of § 355(b).  Rev.   Rul.   2003-18,   2003-7   I.R.B.   467,   concludes   that   the   acquisition  by a dealer   engaged   in the   sale   and   service   of brand   X   automobiles   of a  franchise   (and the assets   needed)   to sell and   service   brand   Y automobiles  is an   expansion   of the   brand   X   business   and   does   not constitute   the  acquisition of 4   new   or   different   business   under   § 1.355—3(b)(3)(ii)  because   (1) fhe produotottha   brandiearzamouile e brand X automobile   dealership   is similar to  the   product   of   the   brand   Y   automobile   dealership,   (ii)   the   -businéss  activities   associated   _with   the   operation   of   the   brand   X   automobile  dealership   (i.e., sales   and   service)   are   the same   as the business   activities  associated   with   the   operation   of the brand   Y   automobile   dealership,   and  (i11) the   operation of the brand   Y automobile   dealership   invglves   the use  of the experience and know-how that   the dealer developed in the operation of the brand X automobile dealership.  ANALYSIS  The product of the retail shoe store business and the product of the web site are the same (shoes), and the principal business activities   of the  retail shoe store business are the same as those of the web site (purchasing shoes at wholesale   and reselling them at retail). Selling  shoes on a web site requires some know-how not associated   with  operating a retail   store, such as familiarity with different marketing approaches, distribution   chains, and _ technical operations issues. Nevertheless, the web site’s operation does draw to  a significant   extent on   D’s existing experience   and know-how, and the web site’s success will  depend in large measure on   the goodwill   associated   with D and the D  name.   Accordingly, the   creation by D of the Internet web site does not constitute   the acquisition of a new or different business under § 1.355—  3(b)(3)(@i). Instead, it  is an expansion of  D’s retail shoe store business. Therefore,   each of D and C is engaged in  the  active conduct of a five-year active trade or business immediately after the   distribution. See   Rev.   Rul.  2003-18   and § 1.355—3(c), Examples (7) and (8).  HOLDING The creation by a corporation engaged in   the retail shoe store  business of  an   Internet web site that sells shoes at retail constitutes   an expansion of  the retail shoe store business   rather   than   the   acquisition   of a new or different   business   under   § 1.855—3(b)(3)(ii).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  Revenue   Ruling   2007-42  2007-2   Cum.   Bull.   44.  ISSUE(S)  Under   the   facts   described   below,   is a   corporation (D) that   owns   a membership   interest   in a limited   liability   company   (LLC)   classified   as   a partnership for Federal   tax   purposes   engaged in   the   active conduct   of a  trade   or   business   fo: for   purposes   of § 355(b)   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code?  FACTS  Situation   1  LLC   is a domestic   limited   liability   company   that   has   been   classified  as   a partnership   for Federal   tax   purposes   since   its date   of organization.  For   more   than   five   years,   LLC   has   owned   several   commercial   office buildings   that   are   leased   to unrelated   third   parties.   LLC   has   one   class   of membership   interests   outstanding.   For   more   than   five   years,   D   has  owned   a   33   1/3-per   ip   interest   in LLC,   and   has   owned   all  the   stock   of a   subsidiary   (C),   a   corporation   that   has   been   engaged   for more   than   five   years   in the   active   conduct   of a trade   or   business   that   is  unrelated   to D’s   activities.  LLC   continuously   seeks   additional   properties   to   expand   its   rental business.   When a   property   is located,   LLC   negotiates   its purchase   and financing   and   determines   whether   renovations   or   alterations   are necessary   to   make   the   building   suitable   for   rental.   LLC   periodically  repaints   and   refurbishes   its existing   properties.  Pursuant   to the terms   of its leases,   LLC   provides   day-to-day   upkeep  and   maintenance   services   for its office   buildings.   These   services   include trash   collection,   ground   maintenance,   electrical   and   plumbing   repair,  and   insect   control.   Additionally,   LLC   advertises   for new   tenants,   verifies  information   contained   in   lease   applications,   negotiates   leases,   handles  tenant   complaints,   prepares   eviction   notices   and   warnings   for delinquent  tenants,   collects   rent,   and   pays   all   expenses,   including   gas,   water,  sewage,   electricity   and   insurance   for   the   office   buildings.   LLC   also  maintains   financial   and   accounting   records   to   reflect   income   and  expenses   relating   to each   of its rental   properties   as well   as LLC’s   general  expenses. The   above   described activities   of LLC have   been   conducted for more  than five years. The   employees of LLC perform all management and operational   functions   with   respect to LLC’s rental   business.   Neither D “nor   any   other member of LLC performs services   with   respect to LLC’s business. For a valid   business   purpose, D proposes to distribute all its C stock pro   rata to   D’s shareholders in   a transaction   intended to   satisfy   the  requirements of § 355.  473

474 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Except   for the   issue   of whether   D is engaged   in the   active   conduct of a trade   or   business   under   § 355(b),   the   transaction   will   otherwise   meet all the requirements   of § 355. Situation   2  The   facts   are   the   same   as   Situation   1   except   that   D   owns   a20> percent   membership   interest   in LLC.  LAW   AND ANALYSIS  Section   355(a)   provides   that,   under   certain   circumstances,   a  corporation   may   distribute   stock   or securities   in a corporation   it controls  to its shareholders   or security   holders   in a transaction   that   is nontaxable to such   shareholders   or security   holders.   Sections   355(a)(1)(C)   and   355(b) require   that   both   the   distributing   and   controlled   corporations   be engaged,   immediately   after   the   distribution,   in   the   active   conduct   of a trade   or   business   that   has   been   actively   conducted   throughout   the   five- year   period   ending   on   the   date   of distribution.  Section   1.355—3(b)(2)(i)   of the   Income   Tax   Regulations,   in defining  trade   or   business   for   purposes   of § 355,   provides   that   a   corporation   is treated   as   engaged   in   a   trade   or   business   immediately   after   the  distribution   if-a specific   group   of activities   are   being   carried   on   by the  corporation   for the purpose of earning   income   or profit,   and   the activities  included in such group include every operation that forms a part of, ora  step "in,theprocess ofearning income oF   profit Such group ofactivities  ordinarily   must   include the collection   of income   and   the   payment   of  expenses.  Section 1.355—3(b)(2)(iii) provides that   the determination   whether a  trade or business is actively conducted will be made from all the facts and  circumstances.   Generally, for a trade or business to be   actively  conducted, the corporation   is_required itself   to perform active and  substantial management and   operational functions. Generally, activities performed   by the corporation itself do not include activities performed   by  persons outside   the corporation, including independent contractors. A corporation   may,   however, satisfy the   active trade or business test  through the activities that it performs itself, even though   some of its  activities   are performed   by others. Under   § 1.355-3(b)(2)(iv),   the   active conduct of a trade or business  does not include the holding of property for  investment   purposes. It also  does   not include   the ownership   and   operation   (including   leasing)   of property   used in a trade or business,   unless   the owner   performs  significant   services   with   respect to the operation   and management of  the  property.  The fact that a partnership   engages in   activities   that would constitute   the   active conduct of a trade or business if conducted   by a corporation   does not necessarily   mean   that   each   partner   in   the  partnershi   active   conduct   of  a trade or business   for purposes   of §  355(b).   In  such a  case,   the   determination   of

--- Page 545 ---

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  whether a partner is considered to be engaged in the active conduct of a  trade or business must be based on the requirements of § 355 and the  regulations thereunder taking into account the activities   of the partner  (if any),   the partner’s interest in the partnership, and the activities   of the  partnership.  Rev. Rul. 92-17,   1992-1 C.B. 142, considers whether D, a corporate  general   partner in a limited partnership, is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of § 355(b). For more than five years, D   owned a 20-percent interest in LP, a limited partnership that  owned several commercial office buildings leased to unrelated third  parties.   D’s officers performed active and substantial management functions   with respect to LP,  including the   significant business decision- making of the partnership, and regularly   participated in the   overall supervision, direction, and control of LP’s employees in operating LP’s rental   business. concludes that D is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business   within the meaning of § 355(b). Rev. Rul. 2002-49,  2002-2 C.B.   288, reaches a similar conclusion where D and   another  corporation (X) each own a 20-percent interest in a member-managed LLC that is classified as a partnership for Federal tax purposes   and D and X jointly manage the LLC’s business.  By   comparison,   § 1.368—1(d)(4)(@11)(B),   regarding   the   continuity   of business   enterprise   requirement   applicable   to corporate   reorganizations, provides   that   the   issuing   corporation   will   be   treated   as   conducting   a business   of   a   partnership   if members   of   the   qualified   group,   in   the aggregate,   own   an   interest   in the   partnership   representing a significant interest   in that   partnership   business.   Those   regulations   indicate   that   a one-third   interest   in the   partnership   represents   a significant   interest   in  the   partnership   business,   and   a corporation   that   owns   such   interest   but  does   not perform   active   and   substantial   management   functions   for the  business   of the   partnership is nevertheless   treated   as   conducting   the  business   of the   part  In   Situation   1, D   is Seen in   the   active   conduct   of LLC’s   rental  business   for purposes   of § 355(b)   because   D owns a significant   interest   in  LLC and LLC performs the required activities that constitute-an-active  trade   or business   under   the   regulations.

Rul.   92-17   is modified   to the   extent   it indicated   that   a partner must   perform   management   functions   in   order   for   the   partner   to   be  treated   as   engaged   in the   active   conduct   of the   trade   or   business   of the  partnership.  NOTE  Although   the   anti-bailout   objective   of the   active   business   requirement  is clear   enough,   this   multifaceted   test   has   engendered   many   controversies.  The   Lockwood   case   is   typical   of   the   Commissioner’s   unsuccessful   early  efforts   to   apply   the   test   strictly.   The   Service   has   since   retreated   on   many  previously   contentious   issues   and   most   of   these   changes   of   heart   are  reflected   in the regulations   and   in comprehensive   proposed   regulations   that,  although   not yet final, are   already influencing   the interpretation   of the active trade   or   business   requirement.4?   The   proposed   regulations   were   issued   in  response   to the   enactment   of Section   355(b)(3),   which   substantially   revised the   active   trade   or   business   requirement   for   corporations   that   utilize  complex   structures   such   as   subsidiaries   and   partnerships   to   conduct   their activities.   They   also   incorporate   and   “upgrade”   several   decades   of rulings  and   cases.   This   Note   surveys   the   settled   and   lingering   questions,  incorporating   selectively   the   proposed   regulations.  Trade or Business: In General. Both the distributing and the controlled  corporation (or the controlled corporations in the case of a split-up) must be engaged   immediately after the distribution in a trade or business   with a five- year history. The regulations treat a corporation as being engaged in a trade  or business if:44  *** a specific group of   activities   are being carried on by the corporation for the purpose of earning   income or profit, and the activities included in such   group include   every operation that forms a part of,  or   a step in, the process of earning   income or profit. Such group of activities ordinarily must include the   collection   of income and the payment of expenses.  The regulations go on to create a dichotomy   between the   active conduct of a trade or business   and passive investment activities. Although the  determination of whether a trade or business is “actively conducted” is a  factual question   turning on all the facts and   circumstances, active business  status generally   requires   the corporation to   itself perform active and  substantial management and   operational functions.4® For this purpose, the activities performed   by persons   outside   the  corporation,   such as independent  43 See REG—123365-03, 2007-1 C.B.   1857.  44 Reg. § 1.355-3(b)(2)(ii).  45 Reg. § 1.855-3(b)(2)(iii). Under the proposed   regulations,   some of  the   corporation’s  activities, however, can   be performed   by others,   such as employees,   shareholders, affiliated  corporations,   and   partnerships in which the   corporation is   a partner.   Prop.   Reg.   §  1.355— 3(b)(2) (iii).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS   477  contractors, generally are not taken into account.‘® To   preclude a tax-free  separation of passive investment assets, “active conduct” does not include  the holding of property for investment (e.g., raw land or portfolio   securities)  or the ownership and operation (including leasing) of   real or personal  property   used in the owner’s trade or business unless the owner performs significant management services with respect to the property.47 Relative   Size of Active   Trade   or Business.   In interpreting   Section   355(b),  the IRS’s   position   has been   that   “there   is no   requirement   * * * that   a specific percentage   of the   [distributing   or controlled]   corporation’s   assets   be devoted to   the   active   conduct   of a   trade   or   business.”48   But   the   relative   size   of the active   trade   or   business   may   be   a   factor   in   determining   whether   the  transaction   is   being   used   principally   as   a   device   for   the   distribution   of earnings   and   profits.   Some   taxpayers   have   relied   on   this   generous  interpretation   in structuring   transactions   where   a relatively   small   trade   or business   is   combined   in   a   subsidiary   with   substantially   more   valuable investment   assets   such   as   a   highly   appreciated   stock   position.   The   tax- driven   planning   agenda   is   to   distribute   the   investment   assets   to shareholders   or   sell   them   without   payment   of any   corporate-level   tax.   To  combat   this   abuse,   the   IRS   has   announced   that   it   will   not   rule   on   the  application   of § 355   to transactions   in which   the value   of the business   assets relied   upon   by either the   distributing   or controlled   corporations   to satisfy the active   trade   or business   test   1   he value   of the total  gross   assets   of such   corporation.*?   These   and   other   transactions   with   similar characteristics,   and   proposed   regulations   under   various   Section   355  requirements   to   address   the   IRS’s   concerns,   are   discussed   later   in   this  chapter.®°  Real   Estate.   The   Service   has   consistently   maintained   that   the   holding of   vacant   investment   land   does   not   constitute   an   actively   conducted business.5!   Real   estate   qualifies   as   an   active   business   only   if the   owner  performs   “significant   services   with   respect   to the operation   and   management  of the   property.”5?   Thus,   the   Service   will   not   approve   the   spin-off of vacant land   or   mineral   rights   on   ranch   land,   even   if development   activities   are imminent.®3   But   it   will   sanction   the   separation   of   an   office   building substantially   leased   (10 of 11   floors)   to outsiders   and   actively   managed   by the   lessor.54   The   Service   also   has   ruled   that   a real   estate   investment   trust’s  rental   activities   can   constitute   an   active   trade   or   business   if, for   example,  46 Reg. § 1.355~3(b)(2)(iii).   Activities performed   by  independent contractors, however, are considered if the corporation itself performs a sufficient quantity of  active management and operational functions. See Rev. Rul. 73-234,   1973-1 C.B.   180; Prop.   Reg. § 1.355—38(b)(2) (i).  47   Reg.   § 1.355—3(b)(2)(iv).  48   Rey.   Rul.   73-44,   1973-1   C.B.   182. 49   Rev.

478 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  the REIT provides significant   services to its tenants.5> Even if the active  business   hurdle is surmounted, however, separations of  real estate may be vulnerable under the  “device” and business purpose tests.°®  For   many   years,   the   IRS   has   carefully   scrutinized   the   separation   of  owner   occupied   real   estate   in   enforcing   the   active   trade   or   business requirement.’   Activist   investors   then   began   urging   corporations   to spin off  real estate   assets   to provide   greater   shareholder   value   from   those   properties.  Thus,   retailers,   restaurant   chains,   casino   operators   and   telecommunications companies   undertook   to spin off their real estate   assets   into separate   publicly  traded   REITs.   The   operating   business   then   would   typically   lease   back   the real   estate,   and   the   rental   income   paid   to the   REIT   would   pass   through   to  the   shareholders   without   being   subject   to   an   entity-level   tax.58   The economics   of this transaction   only made   sense   if the distribution   qualified   as tax-free   under   Section   355.  One   of   several   difficulties   with   this   technique   is   that,   after   the distribution,   the REIT   normally   just collected   rents   and   thus   failed to engage in an   active   trade   or business.   A possible   solution   was   to include   a qualifying active   business   with   the nonqualifying   real   estate   assets   as   part   of the   spin-  off.59 This   is similar   to the strategy   previewed   above   where a relatively   small  active   business   is combined   with   substantial   investment   assets   in the   hope  that   the active   trade   or business   hurdle   can   be surmounted.  Congress eventually addressed the concern   with REIT spin-offs by enacting Section   355(h) which disqualifies a transaction under Section   355 if either   the distributing or controlled corporation is a REIT.®° If a corporation that is not a REIT is the distributing or controlled corporation in  a qualified Section   355   transaction, it may not elect tax treatment   under the special REIT regime for any taxable   year beginning before   the end of the 10- year   period beginning on the   date of the distribution.1 Vertical Divisions   of a Single Integrated   Business. Suppose a corporation   wishes to divide a single trade or business that has been operated for more   than five years? Does Section   355   require   two   separate predistribution   trades or businesses,   each   with its own five-year history, or may one   existing business be   divided in two? After   several defeats,®2   the  Service acknowledged that Section   355 can apply to the separation of a single  55 Rev. Rul. 2001-29,   2001-1 C.B.   1348.  56 See, e.g., Reg. § 1.855—2(d)(2)(iv)(C).  57   Reg.   § 1.355—3(b)(2)(ii).  58 Under a special   tax regime, REITs generally are   not subject to an   entity-level   tax if  they pass through   most of  their income to their shareholders.  59 See Hoffman, “IRS   Raises Red Flag on Real-Estate Spinoffs,” Wall St.  J., Sept.15,   2015, available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/irs-raises-red-flag-on-real-estate-spinoffs-1442359003 as   LR.C.  § 355(h)(1). This   general   disqualification rule  does   not apply if, immediately after  the   distribution, both the   distributing   and controlled   corporations are REITs and in a specialized   situation   involving a spin-off  of a taxable REIT subsidiary. I.R.C. § 355(h)(2).  61 LR.C. § 856(c)(8).  { 62 See  Coady v. Commissioner, 33  T.C.   771   (1960),   affirmed   per curiam   289   F.2d   490   (6th  Cir.1961)   (single   construction   business   divided   into two   businesses to resolve   shareholder dispute); United  States v. Marett,   325   F.2d   28   (5th   Cir.1963)   (food manufacturer   operating at three   factories   spun off  one   factory  opened   eight  months   before   the distribution).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 479 business. Thus, assuming the other statutory and judicial requirements are  met, a corporation engaged in an integrated   business at one   location may  transfer half of its assets to a new subsidiary and distribute the  stock of the  subsidiary to a 50 percent shareholder in a tax-free split-off.63 Similarly, as illustrated by the Lockwood case, a separation of activities in the same line of business conducted at different locations   can be accomplished tax-free if  one of the  locations does not have a five-year history. The current   regulations  look to the character of the activity and commonality of functions in  determining   whether geographically dispersed   operations constitute a single  integrated business.®4  Horizontal   Divisions.   The   treatment   of horizontal   (sometimes   called “functional’)   divisions—i.e.,   separations   of certain   distinct   functions   of   a  single business   enterprise—was   once   uncertain,   but they are   now   authorized  by the   active   trade   or   business   regulations.   To   illustrate   the   issue,   assume  that   a   manufacturer   of high   technology   equipment   wishes   to   spin   off its research   and   development   function   for valid   business   reasons.   The   Service  once   maintained   that   such   support   activities   did   not   constitute   a   separate  trade   or business   because   they   did not   independently   produce   income.®   The  regulations   now   sanction   some   types   of horizontal   divisions,   as illustrated   in  the   following   example:®  For   the   past   eight   years,   corporation   X   has   engaged   in   the manufacture   and   sale   of   household   products.   Throughout   this  period,   X   has   maintained   a   research   department   for   use   in  connection   with   its   manufacturing   activities.   The   research  department   has   30 employees   actively   engaged   in the   development of   new   products.   X   transfers   the   research   department   to   new  subsidiary   Y   and   distributes   the   stock   of Y   to   X’s   shareholders. After   the   distribution,   Y   continues   its   research   operations   on   a  contractual   basis   with   several   corporations,   including   X. X   and   Y both   satisfy   the   requirements   of section   355(b).   * * * The   result   in  this   example   is the   same   if, after   the   distribution,   Y continues   its research   operations   but   furnishes   its services   only to X. * * *  Similarly,   if   a company   that   has   processed   and   sold   meat   products   for more  than   five   years   separates   the   sale   and   processing   functions,   the   active business   test is satisfied.®7 The   regulations   make   it clear   that   the   functional   separation   in   the  example   above   satisfies   the   active   business   test   whether   the   research department   subsequently   provides   services   only to the   business   from   which  it   was   separated   or   also   to   other   customers.   The   example   reflects   the  63 See, e.g., Reg. § 1.355-3(c) Examples (4) & (5); Prop.   Reg. § 1.355—3(d) Examples 14 &  15,  64 See   Reg. § 1.355-3(c) Example 7, which   permits a nine-year old department store to spin off  a suburban   branch   constructed   three   years   ago   where, after  the distribution,   each store  has its own   manager and is operated   independently.  65 Reg. § 1.355—1(c)(3)   (pre-1989).  66 Reg. § 1.355—-3(c) Example (9). See also   Prop.   Reg. § 1.355—3(d) Example 16, which  reaches   the same   conclusion   provided   the   research   department   has   significant   assets   and  goodwill. 67 Reg.   §  1.355-3(c)   Example (10).  See   also   Prop.   Reg.   §  1.355-3(d)   Example 17.

480  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Service’s abandonment of any requirement that   an active business must “independently”   produce income. But even if the   active business test is met, tax-free treatment for a functional division is still not assured. The  transaction also must have a corporate business   purpose, and it must not run afoul of the   “device”   limitation. As we will discover shortly, the  regulations   provide that   the same functional separations that pass muster  under the active business test may present “evidence” of a prohibited bailout  device.®8 Expansion   of a   Trade   or   Business.   To   satisfy   the   active   business   test,  both   the   distributing   and   controlled   corporations—or   each   controlled  corporation   in a split-up—must   have   actively   conducted   businesses   for the  five years   prior   to the   distribution.®   In addition,   those   businesses   must   not  have   been   acquired   within   the   five-year   predistribution   period   in   a  transaction   in which   gain   or   loss was   recognized   by the   seller,   and   must   not have   been   conducted   by a corporation   the   control   (i.e., 80   percent)   of which  was   acquired   by the   distributing   or any   distributee   corporation   in a taxable transaction   during   that   five-year   period.7°   A   purpose   of these   requirements  is to   prevent   a   corporation   from   using   Section   355   to   avoid   the   dividend  provisions   of   Subchapter   C   by   temporarily   investing   its   earnings   in   a business   that   it plans   to spin off to its shareholders. The five-year rules have spawned controversies over whether a particular activity is a separate   business   requiring its own five-year   history or simply part of an integrated   business which has been active for more   than five years. For example, a recently opened suburban branch store may be treated as an integral   part of an ongoing department store business   with a more   than five-year history.71 On the other hand,   businesses   with clearly  distinct products or services (e.g., a chicken   ranch   and a winery) are considered to be   separate.72 As Lockwood and Revenue Ruling 2003-38 illustrate, similar   issues arise   in the   case   of a diversification or expansion of  a business   within the   five-year predistribution period.   In rulings and  regulations, the Service   has offered helpful guidance on this question,  suggesting that a new activity  in the same line of business will be treated as  an expansion of the original business   unless the “purchase, creation, or other acquisition effects a change of such a character as   to constitute   the acquisition of a new or different business.”73   This   interpretation   permits a  68 See   Reg. § 1.3855—2(d)(2)Gv)(C).  69   I.R.C.   § 355(b)(2)(B).  70 IRC. § 355(b)(2)(C)—-(D); Reg. § 1.355-3(b)(1)-(5).   For this purpose, a “taxable transaction” is one in which gain or loss was   recognized in whole or in part by the seller.   If  a business 1s acquired in a tax-free reorganization, its previous history’  carries   over   (along   with  its tax   attributes) for purposes of the  five-year rule.  ml Reg. § 1.3855—3(c) Example (7).  7” See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 56-655,   1956-2 C.B. 214 (retail appliance   branch   and retail furniture branch considered   separate   businesses);   Rev.   Rul. 56-451,   1956-2 C.B. 208   (metal  industry magazine separate   from magazine to serve   electrical industry).  73 Reg.   § 1.355—-3(b)(3)(ii). See also Rev.

A   trade   or   business   does   not   qualify   for   purposes   of the   predistribution business   history   requirement   if   it   was   acquired   within   the   five   years preceding   the   distribution   in   a   transaction   in   which   gain   or   loss   was recognized   in whole   or   in part.75   Although   the   statute   is not   crystal   clear,   it  obviously   means   gain or loss recognized   by seller—e.g.,   a taxable   acquisition in   which   the   buyer   takes   a   cost   rather   than   a   carryover   basis.76   Tax-free  acquisitions,   such   as liquidations   of a controlled   subsidiary,   do not disqualify the   acquired   trade   or   business.   Nor   do   acquisitive   reorganizations   if the  target   shareholders   do not   recognize   any   gain as   a result   of receiving   boot.77  The   active   trade   or   business   requirement   also   is not   met   if within   the   five- year   predistribution   period   the   distributing   corporation   acquires   control,  measured   by   the   80   percent   tests   in   Section   368(c),   of   a   corporation  conducting   the   trade   or   business   in   a   taxable   transaction.78   As   explained  below,   however,   the proposed   regulations   treat   stock   acquisitions   that   result  in the   distributing   corporation   obtaining   control   of the   acquired   corporation  as   if they   were   asset   acquisitions   because,   once   the   acquisition   occurs,   the corporations   are   treated   as   a single   corporation.79  Activities   Conducted   by   a   Partnership   or   LLC.   With   the   issuance   of Revenue   Ruling   2007—42,89   the   Service   has   clarified   when   a   corporate  partner   is   considered   to   be   engaged   in   the   active   conduct   of   a   trade   or  business   by   attributing   to   it the   activities   performed   by   a   partnership   in which   it holds   an   interest.   Prior   rulings   held   that   a corporate   partner   could  be   treated   as   engaged   in   the   active   conduct   of a   trade   or   business   of the  partnership   if the   corporation   itself or   through   its officers   performed   active  74   The   proposed   regulations   endorse   this   approach   and   make   it clear   that   a corporation can   expand   an   existing   active   trade   or   business   by acquiring   not   only   assets   but   also   enough stock   (at least   80 percent   of the voting   power   and value)   in another   corporation   in the same   line  of business   to qualify   the   new   subsidiary   as   a member   of the   acquiring   corporation’s   “separate  affiliated   group.”   Prop.   Reg.   § 1.355—3(b)(3)(ii),   —3(d)(2)   Examples   18 &   20.  7   ~J.R.C.   § 355(b)(2)(C).  76 See   Bittker & Eustice, supra note 2, § 11.05[2][a]. The   proposed regulations   elaborate in great detail. See   Prop.   Reg. § 1.355—3(b)(4). 71   Bittker   & Eustice,   supra   note   2, 4 11.05[2][a]. 78 T.R.C. § 355(b)(2)(D)(ii).   In  addition, if control   of a corporation   conducting the  trade or business is acquired   by a corporate   distributee shareholder   within the five-year   period  preceding ~the   distribution in a transaction in which gain or loss is recognized,   the   active   trade or business  requirement is not   met.   I.R.C. § 355(b)(2)(D)(@). For   an explanation of this cryptic   rule and related roadblocks to using   corporate divisions to avoid   corporate-level   gain on   the sale   of a  business, see Section #1 of  this chapter, infra.  79 Prop.   Reg. § 1.355-3(b)(1)(ii),   —3(b)(4)(iv)(F). If   this regulation becomes final,   the applicability   of   Section   355(b)(2)(D) will be   limited to situations where   D acquires   stock  constituting   “control”   of C as measured   by the   Section   368(c)   tests   (voting power   and   other  classes   of stock)  but  not the type  of  control measured   by  Section   1504(a)   (voting power   and  value)  that   would   cause   C to become   part   of D’s   separate   affiliated   group.  80   Supra   p. 473.

Revenue Ruling 2007—42 goes further and attributes to a member that owns  a “significant interest” (at least one-third) in an LLC’s capital and profits the trade or business of the LLC even if the corporate member does not itself  directly conduct any activities relating to the LLC’s business.®?  Treatment   of Affiliated   Groups.   A   corporation   historically   was   treated as   actively   conducting   a trade   or business   if it did so directly   (e.g., through   a division)   or   if “substantially   all’   of   its   assets   consisted   of   the   stock   or securities   of one   or more   “controlled”   corporations   each   of which   was   engaged in the active   conduct   of a trade   or business.®*   As   a result,   a holding   company not   directly   conducting   any   business   activities   still   could   satisfy   the   active trade   or   business   test   if substantially   all of its   assets   consisted   of stock   or securities   of a controlled   corporation   that   itself conducted   the   business.   In  some   situations,   however,   a   holding   company   was   forced   to   orchestrate  cumbersome   predistribution   maneuvers   by   relocating   active   businesses within   the   corporate   group   in   order   to   satisfy   the   “substantially   all”  requirement   and   qualify   a distribution   under   Section   355.84  To simplify planning for corporations   with more complex capital structures, Congress eliminated the “substantially all” test and   added Section 355(b)(3), which provides that, for purposes of determining   whether a corporation is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, all  members of that corporation’s separate affiliated group   (“SAG”) are treated  as one corporation.®> A distributing or controlled   corporation’s SAG is the group consisting of each   such   corporation as the “common parent” and all corporations “affiliated” with the common parent through the   control tests  (i.e., 80 percent or more ownership of voting power   and value) in Section  1504(a)(1)(B).86  This means that   the distributing or controlled corporation will be  treated as actively conducting a trade or business   during the   five-year predistribution   period and immediately after a distribution if any lower-tier affiliate in its SAG is  so engaged.   The SAG rules   not only   simplify planning for corporations   with complex structures   but also may have a ripple effect on whether a transaction qualifies under Section 355. For example,   because the acquisition of stock of a subsidiary is treated as an acquisition of assets, it may qualify as an expansion of  an existing   trade or business.87 But if any  81 Rev.

Reg. § 1.355-3(b)(2)(v)(C), which requires the corporate   partner to own a “meaningful” interest (at  least 20 percent is meaningful   based on prior rulings)   in  the partnership.  82 See also Prop.

Lemon Corporation has been engaged in the manufacture and sale of  personal computer   hardware   equipment for ten years at two plants,   one in Boston, Massachusetts and the other in San Jose, California. During this same period, Lemon also has operated at each location a separate   research  and development division, each of which had significant assets and goodwill. Lemon’s common stock, the only class outstanding, is owned equally by Ms.  Micro and Mr.   Chips. In each of the following   alternative   transactions,  consider whether the active trade or business requirement has been  satisfied: Splye a  (a) As a result of a shareholder dispute, Ms. die wishes to say  goodbye to Mr. Chips.

The   consideration   for   that   acquisition   consisted   of   Lemon nonvoting   preferred   stock   (80%)   and   Lemon   short-term   notes  (20%).  2.   DC   Enterprises   (“DC”)   is a large   manufacturing   company   which   owns  the   10 story building   in which   it conducts   its business.   For the past   15 years,  it has   used   six floors for its own operations   and   rented   the other   four   floors  to   unrelated   tenants.   Six years   ago,   DC   formed   a wholly   owned   subsidiary,   —  Properties,   Inc.,   which   leases   two   other   commercial   buildings   previously owned   by DC   on   a   long-term   net   lease   basis,   under   which   the   tenants   are responsible   for   property   taxes,   Insurance   and   maintenance.   Consider  whether   the   following   alternative   transactions   satisfy   the   active   trade   or business   requirement: (a)   On   the   advice   of   a management   consultant,   DC   transfers   its  10 story   office building   to a new   corporation,   Rental,   Inc.,   and distributes   the Rental   stock   pro   rata   to its shareholders.   After  the   distribution,   DC   leases   from   Rental   the   six   floors   that   it  occupies;   and   Rental   continues   to rent   the   other   four   floors   to unrelated   tenants.   Rental   employees   actively   manage   the  building   and   perform   repair   and   maintenance   services.  (b) Same as (a), above,   except that DC only  occupies one floor and the remaining space is leased to unrelated tenants. (c) Same as (b), above,   except the nine floors   are rented to outsiders under a long-term net lease. (d) DC distributes all the   stock of Properties, Inc. pro   rata to the  DC shareholders. After   the   distribution, Properties   continues  its rental activities.  C. JUDICIAL   AND STATUTORY LIMITATION S  1. BUSINESS PURPOSE  Regulations: § 1.355—2(b).  Background.   The   business   purpose doctrine   originated in Gregory v.  Helvering®9   and rapidly assumed its role as one of the first “common law” principles of federal   taxation. The doctrine   has become an increasingly important limitation under Section   355   even though it   is never mentioned in the   Code. The   business   purpose   and device   limitations are  conceptually linked, each   focusing on   the taxpayer’s motivation for the  transaction. It   is appropriate to consider   the business   purpose requirement first because the strength or weakness of a corporate  business   purpose is evidence in determining   whether a transaction   was used   principally as   a device for distributing   earnings   and profits.9°  Moreover, the  regulations   have   long  provided   that the  “business   purpose  89   See   p. 457,   supra.  90   Reg.   § 1.355—2(b)(4),   (d)(3)@i).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  requirement is independent of the other requirements under section 355.”91 Thus, a corporate division lacking a business purpose cannot be accomplished tax free even if it is not used principally as a device to bail out earnings   and profits.9 Business Purpose Regulations. The regulations define a corporate  business purpose as “a   real and substantial   non Federal tax purpose  germane to the business of the distributing   corporation, the controlled  corporation or the affiliated group *** to which the distributing corporation belongs.”93 Valid business   purposes include compliance with  antitrust and other regulatory decrees, resolution of shareholder  disputes, or even amicable partings to permit   shareholders to pursue separate   business interests.94 Among other business purposes approved  by the   courts and the Service over   the years are: facilitating a merger of  the distributing or controlled corporation;% increasing access to credit or new equity investment (such as by enabling either   the controlled or distributing corporations to raise capital on more favorable terms  through a public offering);9* resolving labor problems;97   providing an  equity interest to  a newly-hired   key employee;98 and warding off a hostile  takeover.99  A pure   shareholder   purpose,   such   as   personal   estate   planning,   does  not   suffice   under   the regulations,!°   but the transaction   may   pass   muster  if a   shareholder   purpose   is   “so   nearly   coextensive   with   a   corporate business   purpose   as   to   preclude   any   distinction   between   them.”!9   For  example,   in   Revenue   Ruling   2003—52,192   the   Service   ruled   that   the  division   of a family   farm   business   into   two   separate   corporations,   one   to  grow   grain   and   the other   to raise   livestock,   satisfied   the business   purpose  requirement.   The   division   was   motivated   by a   desire   to permit   the   two principal   shareholders   (a brother   and   sister   who   disagreed   over   the  future   direction   of the   family   business)   to   go   their   separate   ways   and  devote   their   undivided   attention   to   the   businesses   in which   they   were  most   involved,   and   also   to   promote   family   harmony   and   further   the  estate   planning   goals   of their   parents,   who   also   were   shareholders.

486  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Service concluded that since the principal motivation for the transaction was to benefit both businesses, the fact that it also facilitated personal  estate planning of the shareholders   and promoted family harmony was  not fatal.  Similarly,   the   Service   found   nearly   co-extensive   corporate   and  shareholder   purposes   on   a separation   of two   lines   of business   of a public company   that   was   motivated   by   a   desire   to   increase   the   aggregate trading   price   of the   stock   of both   businesses   after   they   became   separate corporations.13   In addition   to the obvious   shareholder   benefit,   the higher stock   prices   were   found   to   benefit   the   distributing   corporation   in   two alternative   situations:   (1)   by   enhancing   an   equity-based   employee  compensation   plan without   diluting the interests   of existing   shareholders  by issuing   more   stock,   and   (2) by allowing   the   corporation   to use   its own  (more valuable)   stock   as partial consideration   for future   acquisitions   with  significantly   less   dilution   of existing   shareholder   interests.14 The   Service   has   ruled   that   the reduction   of state   and   local   taxes   can be a corporate   business   purpose.   But   the regulations   make   it clear   that  the   reduction   of “non   Federal”   taxes   is   not   an   independent   corporate business   purpose   if: (1) the   transaction   will   result   in a reduction   in both Federal   and   non   Federal   taxes   because   of similarities   in the   respective  laws,   and   (2)   the   reduction   of   Federal   taxes   is   greater   than   or substantially   coextensive   with   the   reduction   of non   Federal   taxes.106   For  example,   a spin-off of a subsidiary   to enable   one   or   both   of the   resulting corporations   to   elect   S corporation   status   is not   a   business   purpose107  even   though   the   transaction   may   bear   little   resemblance   to the   original bailout   evil of Gregory   v. Helvering.  A business   purpose for a distribution also does not exist if the same  corporate objectives   can be met through a nontaxable transaction that does not require a distribution of stock of a controlled corporation and which is neither   impractical nor unduly expensive.1°8   For example,  assume that a corporation manufactures both toys and   candy   through  divisions which are not separately   incorporated, and the shareholders wish to insulate   the candy business   from the risks   of the   toy business. If that   goal   can   be achieved by   dropping down the   assets of one of  the businesses to   a new subsidiary, a subsequent distribution of the  subsidiary’s   stock to the   parent’s shareholders is not   carried   out for a  corporate   business purpose. 109  *  103 Rev.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 487  The fact that Section   355 permits a distributing corporation to avoid  corporate-level   gain on the distribution of stock of a controlled corporation is not considered by the Service to present   such a potential  for avoidance of federal   taxes   that it overrides an otherwise valid  corporate   business purpose.!!0 The Service also has ruled that as long as  a distribution is motivated in whole or substantial part by a corporate  business purpose at the time it is made, the corporation’s later failure to succeed in meeting that purpose will not prevent the distribution from satisfying the business   purpose requirement.!" In   addition, continuing  relationships for a limited period of time between the distributing and  spun-off companies do not necessarily   jeopardize the distribution from  qualifying under Section 355.112 A   notable   addition   to   the   list   of   acceptable   business   purposes   is known   as   “fit   and   focus.”   The   Service   has   ruled!3   that   a   software  company’s   spin-off   of a   paper   products   business   satisfied   the   business purpose   requirement   because   the   distribution   was   motivated   by a desire to   allow   senior   management   of   the   distributing   corporation   “to  concentrate   its   efforts   on   the   software   business,   which   it   believes  presents   better   opportunities   for   growth   and   allow   the   management   of the paper   products   business   to secure   for that business   the   management  resources   needed   for its full development.”   The   ruling   also states   that the  existence   of common   directors   of the   distributing   and   spun-off companies does   not   necessarily   preclude   reliance   on   a   “fit   and   focus”   business  purpose.  2.   CONTINUITY   OF   INTEREST  Regulations:   § 1.355—2(c). The   regulations   require   that   those   persons   who   historically   owned an   interest   in the   enterprise   prior   to   a   corporate   division   must   own,   in  the   aggregate,   an   amount   of stock   establishing   a continuity   of interest   in each   of the modified   corporate   forms   in which   the enterprise   is conducted  after the distribution.!14   This   means   that one   or more   of the shareholders  of the   distributing   corporation   must   emerge   from   the transaction   (in the  aggregate)   with   at   least   a   50   percent   equity   interest   in   each   of the  110 Rey. Rul. 2003-110,   2003-2 C.B. 1083   (corporation   used   Section   355 to separate its baby food and pesticide businesses to improve a market perception problem arising from the  baby food company’s affiliation with a pesticide   business).  111 Rev. Rul. 2003-55,   2003-1 C.B.   961, where the business   purpose for   a corporate  separation   was to facilitate the   raising of  capital through an initial public   offering   of  the   stock  ~of what previously   was a wholly owned subsidiary of  the   distributing   corporation. Even   though  market conditions unexpectedly deteriorated   and the  public  offering was   postponed indefinitely,  there   was a valid business   purpose at the  time   the   distribution   was   made.  12 See  Rev.   Rul. 2003-75,   2003-2 C.B.   79, where a distribution   was made to resolve   issues  relating to the competition for capital between two   businesses   (pharmaceuticals   and   cosmetics) and,   after   the   spin-off,   the   two companies   entered into   “transitional” agreements (two   years, after which the agreements   were to be  renegotiated at arm’s   length for  a limited   period)   relating to information   technology,   benefits   administration,   and   accounting   and   tax   matters.  113   Rey.

488  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  corporations   that   conduct   the   enterprise   after   the   division.!5   The continuity   of   interest   test   overlaps   considerably   with   the   device limitation,   which   patrols   against   prearranged   postdistribution   sales   as  part   of its anti-bailout   mission.   The   regulations   nonetheless   emphasize  that   continuity   of interest   is an   independent   test   that   must   be   met   in  addition   to the   other   Section   355   requirements. 116  A   common   divisive   transaction   involves   the   breakup   of a corporate enterprise   to   allow   feuding   shareholders   to   part   company,   with   each  taking   a   share   of   the   business   in   the   form   of   stock   in   separate corporations.   The   regulations   acknowledge   that   this   type   of transaction, whether   structured   as   a   split-off   or   split-up,   satisfies   the   continuity   of  interest   requirement   because   the   prior   owners   of   the   integrated  enterprise   emerge   in the   aggregate   with   all the   stock   of two   corporations  that   survive   the   separation.   Assume,   however,   that A and   B each   own   50  percent   of the   stock   of P, Inc.,   which   is engaged   in one   business,   and   P  owns   all the   stock   of S, Inc., which   is engaged   in a different   business.   If  new   and   unrelated   shareholder   C purchases   all of A’s   stock   in P and   P  then   distributes   all the   stock   of S to B in redemption   of B’s   P stock,   the  transaction   fails   the   continuity   of interest   test   because   the   owners   of P prior   to   the   distribution   (A   and   B)   do   not,   in   the   aggregate,   own   an  amount   of stock   establishing   continuity   of interest   in both   P and S after the distribution.1!7   Only the historic   shareholders   of P (i.e.,   A and   B) may  be counted   for continuity   of interest   purposes,   and   the   smoking   pistol   is present   if none   of   those   shareholders   owns   any   stock   of   P   after   the  distribution.   As   for who   qualifies   as   an   historic   shareholder,   it appears  that   a shareholder   who   acquires P stock   prior   to the   time   that   P decides  to   engage   in   a   division   should   qualify   even   if the   acquisition   occurred  shortly   before   the   distribution.118   Apparently,   even   a   person   who  acquired   P   stock   in   contemplation   of a   distribution   of S   stock   will   be  treated   as   an   historic   shareholder   if the   acquisition   was   more   than   two years   prior to the   distribution.119  The   shareholders of the distributing   corporation also must   maintain continuity of interest after the   distribution.120 A postdistribution  115 Without explicitly saying so, several examples in the regulations indicate   that a 50 percent   equity interest,   the safe harbor benchmark for Type A reorganizations, is what is needed  to “maintain” continuity of interest. See, e.g., Reg. § 1.355-2(c)(2) Example (2). Although 50 percent   continuity historically was   required to obtain an advance ruling from the   Service,   the  case law   supports a lower   percentage,   and the regulations on acquisitive reorganizations   now  confirm that   the Service will accept   40   percent   continuity for mergers.   Reg. § 1.368—1(e)(2)(iv)  Example 1. It follows   that   40 percent also should be sufficient for corporate divisions, See  Ginsburg   & Levin, Mergers,   Acquisitions & Buyouts, §] 610.2   (April   2018).  , 16 Reg. § 1.855—2(c)(1).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 489  continuity issue might arise, for example, if shareholders sold more than  50 percent of the   stock of either the distributing or controlled corporations shortly after the   distribution. Shareholders who   committed themselves to sell prior to the distribution or who had a fixed intention  to do so are not likely to have maintained continuity of  interest, but an  unanticipated sale should not be a problem.  3.   THE   “DEVICE”   LIMITATION  Code:   § 355(a)(1)(B).  Regulations:   § 1.355—2(d).  a.   IN GENERAL  Section   355(a)(1)(B)   provides   that   a   corporate   division   may   not   be  “used   principally   as   a   device   for   the   distribution   of the   earnings   and profits”   of the   distributing   corporation   or   the   controlled   subsidiary.   The  historic   mission   of this   requirement   has   been   to prevent   the   conversion of   ordinary   dividend   income   into   preferentially   taxed   capital   gain through   a bailout   masquerading   as   a corporate   division.!21   This   goal   is reaffirmed   in the   regulations,   which   provide:122  ***   a   tax-free   distribution   of   the   stock   of   a   controlled  corporation   presents   a potential   for tax avoidance   by facilitating the avoidance   of the dividend   provisions   of the Code   through   the subsequent   sale or exchange   of stock   of one   corporation   and   the  retention   of   the   stock   of   another   corporation.   A   device   can  include   a transaction   that   effects   a recovery   of basis. Ever   since   the   device   limitation   was   added   to the   Code,   its meaning and   scope   have   been   mired   in obscurity.   The   regulations   initially   fail to burn   off the fog, declaring   that   “generally,   the   determination   of whether  a transaction   was   used   principally   as   a   device   will   be   made   from   all of  the   facts   and   circumstances.”!23   They   go   on   to   offer   some   guidance   by identifying   certain   “device”   and   “nondevice”   factors   which   are   “evidence” of the presence   or absence   of a device,   but the   strength   of this   “evidence” still depends   on   “the   facts   and   circumstances.”1!24 The   role of the   device   limitation   is diminished   but not   eliminated   as long   as   dividends   and   long-term   capital   gains   of noncorporate   taxpayers are   taxed   at   the   same   preferential   rate.   A   “device”   still   may   include   a  transaction   that   effects   a   recovery   of   a   shareholder’s   stock   basis.   In  situations   where   shareholders   have   a nominal   basis   and   are   indifferent  will   modify   its   postdistribution   continuity   rules   in   the   corporate   divisions   context.   For   an  extensive   discussion   of the   Section   355   version   of the continuity   of interest   doctrine,   see   Shores,  “Reexamining   Continuity   of Shareholder   Interest   in Corporate   Divisions,”   18 Va.

490  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  to dividend vs. capital gain treatment, the question remains whether the Service might invoke the device limitation to tax the distributing  corporation, which   would be required to recognize gain on the  distribution if the transaction does not qualify under Section 355, or  whether it is sufficient to rely on more targeted corporate-level   statutory  watchdogs, such as Sections   355(d) and 355(e), which are discussed later in this chapter.1!25 Transactions   Ordinarily   Not a Device.   Notwithstanding   the presence or   absence   of   the   “device   factors”   to   be   discussed   below,   three  transactions   “ordinarily”   are   not   considered   a   tax   avoidance   device.  Distributions   are   presumed   innocent   if: (1)   the   distributing   and   controlled   corporations   have   neither  accumulated   nor   current   earnings   and   profits   as of the   date  of the   distribution,   taking   into   account   the   possibility   that a   distribution   of appreciated   property   by   the   distributing  corporation   as   part   of a   divisive   transaction   would   create  earnings   and   profits   if Section   355   did not   apply;126  (2)   in the absence   of Section   355, the distribution   would   qualify  as   a   redemption   to   pay   death   taxes   under   Section   303;127  and  (3) in the absence of Section 355, the distribution would qualify, with respect to each distributee shareholder, as an  exchange   redemption under Section 302(a).128  Section   303 and Section   302(a)-type redemptions lose the   benefit of  the presumption,   however, if they involve   the distribution of stock of  more than one controlled corporation   and facilitate the avoidance of the  dividend   provisions of the Code   through the subsequent sale or exchange of stock of one corporation   and the retention of the   stock of another  corporation.129  Device and   Nondevice Factors:   In General. The regulations specify three factors   that are “evidence” of a device   (“device   factors”) and three factors   that are evidence of a nondevice   (“nondevice factors”). The device  factors are:   (1)  a pro   rata   distribution; (2)  a subsequent sale or exchange of stock of  either   the distributing or controlled   corporation; and (3) the  nature   and use   of the   assets   of the   distributing and controlled  corporations immediately after the   transaction.130 The three nondevice  factors are:   (1) the corporate   business   purpose for the  transaction; (2) the  fact that   the   distributing   corporation is publicly   traded   and   widely held; #5 See   Section E of  this chapter, infra.  126 Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(5)(ii).  127 Reg. § 1.355-2(d)(5)(iii).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS   491  and (3) the fact that   the   stock of the controlled corporation is distributed to one or more domestic corporations which   would be entitled to a dividends received deduction under Section 243 if Section   355 does not apply to the transaction.131 The presence of one or more of these factors is not controlling, however, and the “strength” of the evidence depends  on the facts and circumstances. 182  b.   DEVICE   FACTORS  Pro   Rata   Distribution.   A pro   rata   distribution—for   example,   a spin-  off—is   considered   to present   the   greatest   potential   for   avoidance   of the  dividend   provisions   of Subchapter   C   and   thus   is more   likely   to be   used  principally   as   a   device.   As   a   result,   the   regulations   provide   that   a   pro  rata   or   substantially   pro   rata   distribution   is evidence   of a device.133 Subsequent   Sale   or   Exchange   of Stock.   A   parenthetical   clause   in Section   355(a)(1)(B)   cryptically   provides   that   the   “mere   fact”   that   stock  or   securities   of either   the   distributing   or controlled   corporations   are   sold by all or   some   of the   shareholders   is not   to be construed   to mean   that the transaction   was   used   principally   as   a   device.   But   the   Service   has   long  contended   that   a sale of stock   of the distributing   or controlled   corporation  shortly   after   a   corporate   division   is evidence   that   the   transaction   was used   as   a bailout   device.   The   “strength”   of the evidence   depends   upon   the  percentage   of stock   disposed   of after   the   distribution,   the   length   of time  between   the distribution   and the subsequent   sale and the extent   to which the   subsequent   sale   was   prearranged. 1#4 A subsequent   sale   or   exchange   negotiated   or agreed   upon   before   the  distribution   is   “substantial   evidence”   of   a   device.185   A   sale   is   always  prearranged   if it was   “pursuant   to an   arrangement   negotiated   or   agreed upon   before   the   distribution   if enforceable   rights   to buy   or   sell   existed  before   the   distribution.”!36   The   regulations   are   more   equivocal   if a   sale  was   merely   discussed   by   the   parties   but   was   “reasonably   to   be  anticipated.”   In   that   event,   it   “ordinarily”   will   be   considered   to   be  previously   negotiated   or agreed   upon.!37   Seemingly   ignoring   the   express language   of Section   355(a)(1)(B),   the   regulations   also   provide   that   even  in   the   absence   of prior   negotiations   or   agreement,   a   subsequent   sale nonetheless   is “evidence   of a device.”138   Presumably,   the   evidence   would  be   fairly   weak   if the   decision   to   sell   were   not   made   until   after   the  distribution.  131   Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(38).  182   Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(2)(i); -2(d)(3)@).  138   Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(2)(ii). 134   Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(2)(iii)(A). 185   Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(2)(iii)(B). 136   Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(2)(i1i)(D).  137   [d.  138   Reg. § 1.355—-2(d)(2)(iii)(C).

492  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  The perceived bailout abuse of a subsequent sale normally is present  only when the selling shareholders cash out their investment. The regulations logically provide that if the shareholders dispose of stock in  a subsequent tax-free reorganization in which no more than an  “insubstantial” amount of gain is recognized, the transaction will not be  treated as a subsequent sale or exchange. Rather, because the shareholders maintain an   interest in the continuing enterprise, the   stock  received in the exchange is treated as equivalent to the   stock surrendered.189 But   any sale of the new stock received will be   subject to  the “subsequent sale” rules and could   be evidence of a device.14 The   Service’s   reliance   on   subsequent   stock   sales   (whether   or   not  prearranged)   as   substantial   evidence   of   a   device   has   always   been  questionable.   To return   to the earlier   introductory   example,   assume   that Diverse   Corporation   has   actively   conducted   profitable   winery   and  chicken   ranch   businesses   for more   than   five   years.   If Diverse   wished   to spin   off the   chicken   ranch   as   Poultry,   Inc.,   it would   have   no   difficulty satisfying   the   active   business   test.   But   what   if the   spin-off   were   the  prelude   to a prearranged   sale of the Poultry,   Inc.   stock   by the controlling shareholders?   If gain   on   that   sale   were   taxable   to   the   shareholders   at  capital   gains   rates,   or   even   if it merely   effected   a recovery   of part   of the shareholders’   basis   in their   Diverse   Corp.   stock,   should   the   spin-off   be  viewed   principally   as   a device   to bail out   Diverse’s   earnings   and   profits?  In considering these   questions, keep in mind the alternatives  available to Diverse. If the corporation   simply   had sold the chicken   ranch assets and distributed the proceeds to its noncorporate shareholders, the  distribution likely would   have qualified as   a partial   liquidation,   entitling noncorporate   shareholders to exchange (and   thus capital   gains)  treatment.!41 The   same result would   have   occurred if the chicken   ranch  assets were   distributed pro   rata to the shareholders   and sold shortly  thereafter. To be sure, a sale or distribution of the chicken   ranch assets by the corporation would   have triggered   gain at the corporate and shareholder levels.!42 But,   historically at   least, the   principal concern in  Section   355 was not with the double   taxation of corporate   earnings but  rather   the   tax treatment of a distribution to the shareholders. If an economically   equivalent   transaction (i.e., a partial   liquidation) would have qualified for capital gain   treatment, it seems anomalous to classify  a spin-off followed by a prearranged sale of the same   business as   a device to convert   ordinary   dividend   income to capital   gain.   In the last analysis,  the   correct answer   from a policy perspective may be to treat partial liquidation   distributions as dividends to noncorporate   shareholders.  Moreover,   even if  it  is not a device, a distribution   followed by a taxable  189   Reg.   §.1.355—2(d)(2)(iii)(E). 140   Tq.  141 See I.R.C. § 302(b)(4), (e). But see Rev.   Rul. 75-223,   1975-1 C.B.   109, discussed at p 247, supra, in which   the  Service   ruled that a distribution   of  stock  of  a subsidiary   may not  qualify as   a partial   liquidation.   See   also Morgenstern v, Commissioner,   56  T.C,   44 encvany  142, See   Chapters   7  and 8,  supra.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 493  sale is unlikely to satisfy the business purpose test and, if the sale closely follows   the distribution   but somehow escapes the device limitation,   the transaction also may fail the continuity of interest requirement.   And, of course, much of this discussion is less important as long as dividends and  capital gains of noncorporate taxpayers are taxed at the same preferential rate.  Nature   and Use  of the Assets. The regulations also enforce the  device  limitation by taking into account the “nature, kind, amount, and use   of  the   assets of the distributing and the controlled corporations   (and  corporations controlled by  them) immediately after the   transaction.”143 Thus, the existence of assets   that are not used in an active trade or  business,   such as cash and other liquid   assets   that are not related to the  reasonable needs of the active business, is evidence of a device.!44 To  illustrate, assume that Corporation P spins off Corporation S in order to  comply with certain regulatory requirements under state law. As part of the separation, P transfers excess cash (not related to the reasonable needs of P’s or S’s business) to S  and then distributes   the S stock   pro  rata  to P’s shareholders. The result of this infusion of cash into S is that   the  percentage of liquid   assets not related to the   trade or business is  substantially   greater for S than for P. The regulations   view this as  suspect, providing in an example that   the transfer of cash by  P to S is  “relatively strong   evidence of  device.”!45 When coupled with the   pro   rata  nature of the distribution,   the transaction is considered to have   been   used  principally as   a device notwithstanding the “strong business   purpose”  because there was no business purpose for the infusion of cash into 8.146  The   regulations   also   consider   the   relationship   between   the  distributing   and   controlled   corporations   and   the   effect   of a sale   of one   of  the businesses   on the overall   enterprise.   Evidence   of a device   is presented  if the   distributing   or controlled   corporation   is a business   that   principally  serves   the business   of the   other   corporation   (a “secondary   business”)   and  it can   be   sold   without   adversely   affecting   the   business   that   it serves.147 Thus,   the   spin-off   of a   captive   coal   mine   from   a   steel   manufacturer,   a  transaction   which   satisfied   the   active   business   test,!48   nonetheless  presents   evidence   of a device   if the   principal   function   of the coal   mine   is to satisfy   the requirements   of the   steel business   and   the coal   mine   could be   sold   without   adversely   affecting   the   steel   business.!49   The   apparent  143,   Reg.   § 1.355—2(d)(2)(iv). 144   Reg.   § 1.855—2(d)(2)(iv)(A),   (B).  145   Reg.   § 1.355-2(d)(4)   Example   (3). 146 Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(2)(iv)(B);   1.355—2(d)(4) Example (3). Compare Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(4)  Example (2), where the   transfer   of cash   and liquid   securities from the   distributing to the  controlled   corporation   was “relatively weak evidence of  device” because after   the   transfer   the two   corporations   held   liquid   assets   in amounts proportional to the  values of their businesses.  147   Reg.   § 1.855—2(d)(2)(iv)(C).  148   See   Reg.   § 1.355-3(c)   Example   (11). 149 Reg.   §  1.355—2(d)(2)(iv)(C).   Likewise,   the   separation   of the   sales   and   manufacturing  functions   will  constitute   evidence   of  a  device   if  the principal   function   of the   sales   operation   after

494  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2 concern here is not so much with the potential for tax avoidance through  non   arm’s length intercorporate   transactions between the separated corporations. That type of abuse is adequately policed by Section 482,  which authorizes the Commissioner to allocate income or deductions  between or among   commonly controlled   trades or businesses.!59 What appears to be bothering the Service is the likelihood for avoidance of the  dividend provisions of the Code when the   “related function” is not truly  integral to the business from which it has been separated.  c.   NONDEVICE   FACTORS  Acknowledging   that   the   corporate   business   purposes   for   a  transaction   may   be sufficiently   compelling   to outweigh   any   evidence   of a device,   the   regulations   provide   that   the corporate   business   purpose   for a transaction   is   evidence   of   nondevice.!5!   In   keeping   with   the   “sliding  scale”   approach   that   pervades   the   device   regulations,   the   stronger   the  evidence   of device,   then   the   stronger   is the   business   purpose   required   to prevent   determination   that   the   transaction   was   used   principally   as   a  device.52   The   strength   of   a   corporate   business   purpose,   of   course,   is based   on   all the facts   and   circumstances,   including   but   not   limited   to the importance   of achieving   the   purpose   to   the   success   of the   business,   the  extent   to   which   the   transaction   is prompted   by   a   person   not   having   a proprietary   interest   in   either   corporation   or   by   other   outside   factors beyond   the control   of the distributing   corporation,   and   the   “immediacy   of  the   conditions”   prompting   the   transaction.153  The fact that   the distributing corporation is publicly traded and widely held, having no shareholder who directly or indirectly owns   more  than five percent of any class   of stock,   also is evidence of nondevice.154  Finally,   the fact that   the   stock of the controlled corporation is  distributed to   a domestic   corporate   distributee which,   without Section 355, would be entitled to the Section   243   dividends   received   deduction, is  evidence of a nondevice. 155  4. DISTRIBUTIONS   INVOLVING   SIGNIFICANT   CASH   AND OTHER   NONBUSINESS ASSETS  a. CASH-RICH   SPLIT-OFFS Section 355(g)  was   added to the Code to prevent   transactions known as “cash-rich   split-offs” from   qualifying for nonrecognition   treatment.  the separation is to  sell the output   from the manufacturing operation   and the   sales operation could   be sold without   adversely affecting   the manufacturing operation. 150 See Chapter 134A,  infra.  151 Reg. § 1.855—2(d)(8)(ii).  152 Id.  153 [dq 154 Reg.   § 1.355—2(d)(3)(iii). 155 Reg.   §  1.355-2(d)(3)(iv).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  The abuse at which Section 355(g) is directed is best   illustrated by an  example. Assume that for more than five years Investor   Corp. (“I”) has  owned a highly appreciated 30 percent interest in Distributing Corp.  (“D”). I wishes to accomplish what would appear to be  impossible: a sale of its D stock for cash without   paying any current tax. D wishes to buy back   some of its stock and is willing to assist I plan a tax-efficient disposition. To accomplish these objectives, D transfers a small five-year  active trade or business to Controlled Corp. (“C”), a newly   formed  subsidiary, along with a large amount of cash (or other liquid   assets) in exchange for all the C stock. D then redeems I’s D stock by distributing  its C stock to I in exchange for I’s entire holding in D.   I then promptly  liquidates C (its new cash-rich subsidiary),   treating the transaction as   a tax-free liquidation under Section 332.156  Prior   to the   enactment   of Section   355(g),   the   transaction   described  above   was   likely   to   qualify   as   tax-free.   As   previewed   earlier   in   this chapter,   the   active   trade   or   business   test,   as   it has   been   interpreted   by  the   IRS,   did   not   require   the   active   business   of   the   distributing   or  controlled   corporations   to   constitute   any   minimum   percentage   of their  overall   asset   value,!57   and   the   device   limitation   was   not violated   because  the   distributee   shareholder   (I,   in   the   example   above)   completely  terminated   its   interest   in   D.   This   “too   good   to   be   true”   strategy   was  employed   by   several   public   companies   in   high   stakes   transactions,  prompting   the   Treasury   to seek   corrective   legislation. 158  Section   355(g)   provides   that   a   distribution   does   not   qualify   as   tax-  free   if:   (1)   either   the   distributing   or   controlled   corporation   is,  immediately   after   the   transaction,   a   “disqualified   investment  corporation,”   and   (2) any   person   holds,   immediately   after the transaction,  a 50-percent   or greater   interest   (measured   by voting   power   and   value)   in  any   disqualified   investment   corporation   but   only   if such   person   did   not hold   such   an   interest   in   the   corporation   immediately   before   the  transaction.159   D   or   C is a disqualified   investment   corporation   if the   fair  market   value   of its “investment   assets”   is two-thirds   or   more   of the   fair  market   value   of   all   its   assets.16°   Investment   assets   include   cash;  corporate   stock   or   securities;   partnership   interests;   debt   instruments   or  other   evidences   of indebtedness;   any   option,   forward,   or futures   contract,  notional   principal   contract,   or derivative;   foreign currency;   or any   similar asset.161   Various   exceptions   and   special   rules   apply   to   determine   a  156   For a good discussion   of the cash-rich   split-off strategy,   see Willens,   “Dividends,   Capital  “Gains,   and   Spin-offs   Affected   by Increase,   Prevention   and   Reconciliation   Act,”   104   J.

Indeed, in an ironic   twist, Section 355(g) appears to  sanction the very transaction that it was trying to curtail for those who  can wend their way through its requirements. An example of a successful navigator   was Liberty Media Corporation, which shed its major stake in Time-Warner in a tax-free split-off exchange for the Atlanta Braves  baseball team (an active and often successful   trade or business) and $1.38  billion in cash. Liberty Media   engaged in a similar deal when it  exchanged its stake in News Corp. for $465 million in cash and News  Corp.’s holdings in satellite provider DirecTV.  b.   SPIN-OFFS   OF   SIGNIFICANT   NONBUSINESS   ASSETS  As   noted   above,   some   cash-rich   split-offs   are   not   disqualified   by  Section   355(g).   That   section   also   does   not   apply   to   transactions   with  similar   characteristics,   such   as   spin-offs   where   the   distributing   or  controlled   corporation   ends   up   owning   investment   assets   having  substantial   value   relative   to its business   assets.   These   transactions   raise  issues   under   the   active   trade   or   business   requirement,   the   device limitation,   and   the business   purpose   test.  Focusing first on the   active trade or business requirement, recall again that   the IRS historically did   not require that any specific percentage of the distributing or controlled   corporation’s assets must be devoted to the active conduct of a trade or business. But what if either corporation emerges from an attempted Section   355 transaction   with a  relatively small active trade or business combined with   substantial  amounts of cash, corporate stock or securities, debt instruments,   and  similar investment assets? As one IRS official colorfully described the issue, should it matter if a company drops a hot dog  stand into a bucket of investment assets or cash and   then tries  to spin off the   entire business tax free?163  One of the most   highly   publicized   transactions   raising   these   Section  355   qualification   issues was the proposed spin-off  in 2015 by  Yahoo! Inc. of its valuable stock holding in Chinese   e-commerce   company Alibaba  Group   Holding Ltd. Yahoo   proposed to contribute Yahoo   Small   Business (a small-business-services unit with   about   100 employees   and   $50 million  in earnings before   interest,   taxes, and cost recovery)   along   with its  Alibaba   shares to  a newly   formed corporation, Aabaco   Holdings, Inc. The Alibaba   stock was   estimated to be   worth over   95   percent of   the fair  12   LR.C.   § 355(g)(2)(B)Gi)—(v);   355(g)(3)-(5).  163 Hoffman,   “IRS   Raises   Red   Flag on Real-Estate Spin-offs,” Wall St. J.

The IRS refused to issue a ruling on Yahoo’s proposed  transaction and later signaled it might   change its longstanding position on the issue. Initial reports were that Yahoo planned to proceed with the deal without the   IRS’s blessing, relying instead on an opinion of  counsel,16 but in late 2015   Yahoo’s   board of directors abandoned the plan and began considering other options, including a spin-off or sale   of its  core online media and search businesses.166 Two years later, Yahoo sold  its core internet business to Verizon   and changed its name to Altaba,  which continued to hold the   large   stake in Alibaba. The saga ended in  2019, when Altaba announced its intention to sell its Alibaba stock and  liquidate. Shortly   after   declining   to rule   in the Yahoo-Alibaba   transaction,   the IRS   announced   that   it would   study   transactions   in   which   either   the distributing   or   controlled   corporation   owned   a   substantial   amount   of  nonbusiness   assets,   such   as   cash   or   publicly   traded   securities,   as  compared   to the   value   of its active   business   assets.167   It also   announced that   it   ordinarily   will   not   issue   a   ruling   on   any   issue   relating   to  qualification   under   Section   355   if immediately   after   the   distribution   the  fair market   value   of the trade   or business   in the distributing   or controlled  corporation   used   to satisfy   the   active   trade   or business   requirement   was  less than   five percent   of the   total fair market   value   of the   gross   assets   of  such   corporation.!68   And   in 2016,   the   IRS   issued   proposed   regulations   to clarify   the   application   of the   active   trade   or   business   requirement   and the   device   prohibition   to those   types   of transactions. Proposed   Regulations.   The   proposed   regulations   would   create   a new active   trade   or business   requirement   under   which   the “Five-Year-Active- Business   Asset   Percentage”   of both   the   distributing   corporation   and   the  controlled   corporation   must   be   at   least   five   percent.1!69   A   corporation’s  Five-Year-Active-Business   Asset   percentage   generally   is equal   to (1) the gross   amount   of   its   assets   used   in   its   five-year-active   businesses, including   cash   or   cash   equivalents   held   as   reasonable   amounts   of working   capital   and   assets   legally or contractually   required   to be held for exigencies   of   the   business,   regulatory   purposes,   financial   obligations  164   Td.: see   also,   Fleischer,   “Yahoo’s   Trick   Plan   for Tax-Free   Spinoff of Alibaba   Stock,”   N.Y.

498 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  reasonably expected to arise, and commitments to expand or improve the business,   divided by (2) the corporation’s total assets.17° The   proposed regulations also modify the nature and use   of assets  device factor and add a new per se device test. In general,   device potential  will exist if the distributing or controlled corporation owns a large  percentage of nonbusiness assets compared to total assets, or   if the  distributing and controlled corporation’s percentages of these assets  differ substantially. For this purpose,   “business assets” would have the  same meaning as it does under the active trade or business requirement but without   regard to whether the business has been   operated or owned  for more than five years.171 Nonbusiness assets are the corporation’s  gross   assets   that are not business assets.!72 The larger   the percentage of  nonbusiness assets of either corporation, the stronger the evidence of  device. If neither the distributing nor the controlled corporation   has nonbusiness assets   that comprise 20 percent or more of its total assets, the ownership of nonbusiness assets ordinarily would not be evidence of device.173 A difference in the nonbusiness asset percentages   (nonbusiness  assets divided by total assets) for the distributing corporation and  controlled corporation ordinarily would not be evidence of device if the difference is less than 10 percent or, in the case of a non pro   rata distribution, if the   difference is attributable to a need to equalize the  value of the controlled corporation stock and securities distributed and  the consideration exchanged therefor by the   distributees.174  The   proposed regulations also revise   the nondevice factor which  relates to a corporate   business purpose by limiting   the circumstances  when a business purpose may outweigh evidence of a device. Evidence of  device presented by   ownership of nonbusiness assets or a difference  between the nonbusiness asset percentages of the distributing and  controlled corporations   generally can be outweighed   by a corporate business   purpose for the ownership or difference. Under the proposed revision, a corporate   business   purpose that   relates to a separation of  nonbusiness assets from one or more   businesses or from   business assets  would not be evidence of nondevice unless the business   purpose involves an exigency that requires an investment or other use   of the nonbusiness  assets   in one or more businesses.!175 The   proposed   regulations illustrate  this last rule with an example   where there is  a nonproportionate division  of nonbusiness assets because the   lease   of  one corporation will expire in six months   and it retains   the nonbusiness assets to purchase a building  170 See   Prop.   Reg. § 1.355—9(a)(3)—(6).  171 Prop.   Reg. § 1.355—2(d)(2)(iv)(B)(2) and see supra   note   170 and accompanying text.  172 Prop. Reg. § 1.355-2(d)(2)(iv)(B)(3).  13 Prop.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS   499  for relocation. The need to buy the building is an exigency which is  a business   purpose   and evidence of a nondevice.176 Finally, the proposed regulations add a two-pronged per se device test   for distributions involving separation of business assets from  nonbusiness assets. Both prongs must be met for the distribution to be  treated as a per se device. The policy underlying the   per se test is that if either   the distributing or controlled corporations holds a significant  percentage of nonbusiness assets as compared to   a much lower  proportion of such assets held by the other   corporation, the evidence of a  device is so strong that it outweighs the presence of any   countervailing  nondevice factors. The first prong is satisfied if either   the distributing or  controlled corporation has a nonbusiness asset percentage   (nonbusiness assets divided by total assets) of 66 2/3 percent or more.177 The second prong of the test compares the nonbusiness asset percentages of the  distributing and controlled corporations and is met if the nonbusiness  asset percentage of one corporation is: (1) 66 2/3 percent or more but less  than 80   percent, and the   other   corporation’s is less than 30  percent, (2) 80 percent or more but less than 90 percent, and the other’s is less than  40   percent, or (3) more   than 90   percent, and the other’s is less than 50 percent.178 If the   per se test is not satisfied, the general facts and  circumstances test applies to determine if the transaction   was a device.  The only  exceptions to this per se device rule are if the distribution is to  a corporate distributee entitled to  a dividends received deduction or  is  a  transaction ordinarily not considered to be a device, such as transactions  where both the distributing and controlled corporation   have no earnings  and profits.179  PROBLEM  Assume   that   Lemon   Corporation   from   Problem   1 at page   483,   operates a   computer   manufacturing   business   at   only   one   location   where   it   also  conducts   research   and   development   through   a separate   division. Lemon   also  owns   all the   stock   of Floppy   Disk,   Inc.,   a computer   software   manufacturer  that Lemon   purchased   six   yéars agp   in a taxable   transaction.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  Regulations: §§  1.312—10; 1.358-2.  1.   INTRODUCTION  If the requirements of Section   355 and the accompanying judicial  doctrines are   satisfied, other provisions come into play to govern the specific tax consequences (e.g., total or partial nonrecognition of gain, basis, holding period, etc.) to the parties. In this section, we consider the  tax consequences if  a corporate division is preceded by the formation of one or more   new corporations in a Type D reorganization, the consequences of the   division itself, and the   results if the   division fails to  satisfy the statutory and judicial requirements.  If one   or   more   corporations   are   formed   as   a   preparatory   step   to   a qualifying   corporate   division,   the   formation   of the   new   subsidiary   is a  Type D reorganization.1®°   The   parent   (distributing)   corporation does not  recognize gain or‘loss   on   the   transfer of assets   to   the controlled  corporation, '8+-and   it takes   an   exchanged   basis   in the   new   stock   that   it  receives!82   and   may   tack   the_holding   period of any   capital assets or  Section   1231   property   that   it   exchanges   for   the   stock.183   The   newly  formed   controlled   corporation   does   not   recognize   gain   on the   issuance   of  its stock!*4   and it takes   the assets   with   a transferred   basis   and   a tacked  holding   period.185   The   earnings   and   profits   of the parent   corporation   are  apportioned   between   the   parent_and   controlled   corporations   according   to  rules   provided   in the   regulations.186   Section   381,   providing   for carryover of corporate   attributes   in certain   corporate   acquisitions,   does   not   apply to   divisive   reorganizations   and   thus   the   parent   corporation retains   its  tax attributes   other than the earnings   and profits which   are   allocated   to  the   controlled   corporation.  180   T.R.C.   § 368(a)(1)(D).   A   “divisive”   D   reorganization   involves   a   transfer   by   one corporation   of part   of its   assets   to   another   corporation   if, immediately   after   the   transfer,   the  transferor   “controls”   the   transferee   and,   pursuant   to   the   same   plan,   stock   or   securities   of the  controlled   corporation   are   distributed   to   the   shareholders   of the   transferor   corporation   in   a transaction   that   qualifies   under   Section   355.   Id. For this purpose,   the fact that the shareholders  of the   distributing   corporation   dispose   of part   or   all   of their   distributed   stock,   or   that   the distributing   corporation   issues   additional   stock,   is not   taken   into   account.   I.R.C.   § 368(a)(2)(H).  181   T.R.C.   § 361 (a). 182   J.   R.C.   § 358(a). 188   T.R.C.   § 1223(1). 184   T.R.C.   § 1032(a). 185   T.R.C.   §§ 362(b);   1223(2).  186 [.R.C. § 312(h);   Reg. § 1.312-10(a), (c). In the   case   of a newly   created   corporation, this allocation   generally is made in proportion to the   relative fair market values of the assets retained   by the  parent   corporation   and  the assets   transferred to the controlled   corporation.   Reg. § 1.312-10(a).   In a “proper   case,”   the   regulations   provide   that   this  allocation   should   be made in proportion to   the   “net   basis”   (after   reduction for   liabilities)   of the   transferred   and   retained  assets.

502  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  2. CONSEQUENCES TO SHAREHOLDERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS  No Boot Received. If the requirements of Section 355 are met,   the  shareholders or security holders of the distributing corporation   generally  do not recognize gain  orloss on the distribution of stock or securities of  the controlled   corporation.187 The aggregate basis of the   stock or securities in the distributing corporation held by the shareholder is allocated among the   stock and securities of both the distributing and controlled corporations in proportion to their relative fair market values,!88 and the shareholder’s holding period in the   stock or securities of the controlled corporation received in the distribution includes the holding period of the stock or securities of the distributing corporation. 189 Treatment   of Boot.   As   with   most   other   types   of reorganizations,   the  receipt   of boot   in   an   otherwise   qualifying   corporate   division   does   not necessarily   spell   doom   for the   transaction   but   results   in the   recognition  of gain   to   the   shareholder   receiving   the   boot.   For   this   purpose,   boot includes:   (1) cash,   (2) any   property   other   than   stock   or   securities   of the  controlled   corporation   (e.g., short-term   debt   obligations),   (3) securities   of the   controlled   corporation   to   the   extent   that   their   principal   amount  exceeds   the   principal   amount   of any   securities   surrendered,!9   (4) any  stock   of the controlled   corporation   that   was   acquired   by the   distributing corporation   in a transaction   in which   gain   or loss   was   recognized   within  the   five-year   period   prior to the   distribution   (known   as   “hot   stock”),   and  (5) nonqualified   preferred   stock   received   in a distribution   with   respect   to stock   other   than   nonqualified   preferred   stock.191  The rule treating   “hot_stock” as boot   does not apply, however, to any  acquisition of stock  of a controlled  corporation that becomes a member of  the  separate  affiliated group of the  distributing corporation   at‘any time  after the stock is acquired and before it is distributed in the Section   355  transaction under scrutiny.!92 This   modification   was made by regulations that reflect a policy decision to avoid conflicts between the  boot   rules and  the treatment of separate affiliated groups   under the   active trade or business test discussed earlier   in   this chapter.!93   For example, if the  187 T.R.C, § 355(a)(1).  188" 1.R.C.'§ 358(b),, (Cc).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  distributing corporation   had acquired all of the controlled   corporation’s  stock in a taxable transaction that   qualified as an expansion of the  distributing  corporation’s existing trade or business and later distributed all of that stock within five years of the acquisition in an unrelated  transaction, the distribution would satisfy the active trade or business  would be fully taxable hot stock. The   IRS   concluded that such a result  was inconsistent   with Congressional intent.  The   tax treatment   of boot   depends   on   the form   of the   division.   In the  case   of a@pin-off,   the   receipt   of boot   is treated   as   a distribution   to which  Section   301   applies   (without   regard   to   the   shareholder’s   realized   gain)  and   is   thus   a   dividend   to   the   extent   of the   distributing   corporation’s current   and   accumulated   earnings   and   profits   and   a return _of capital   to  the   extent of any balance.1%   In the case   of a split-off orplit-up> both of  which   involve   an   exchange   rather   than   a   distribution,   Section   356(a)(1)  requires   the   shareholder   to recognize   any   realized   gain   to the   extent   of the   boot   received   in the   distribution.   The   characterization   of that   gain is  more   problematic.   Section   356(a)(2)   adopts   the   same   rule   used   for  acquisitive   reorganizations   by   providing   that   if the   exchange   has   “the  effect   of the   distribution   of a dividend,”   the   gain recognized   is treated   as  a dividend   to the OE   ec   ree Ider’s ratable   share of accumul  earnings   and   profits of   the   distributing   corporation.196   The   balance   of any  recognized   fain is treated as gain from the exchange   of property.197   As  explained   in   Revenue   Ruling   93-62,   which   follows   this   Note,   dividend equivalence   is   tested   by   applying   the “before”   and   “after”   ownership  principles   of Section   302   (i.e., meaningful   reduction   of the   shareholder’s  proportionate   interest)   using   an_assumption   that   the   shareholder   had  retained   the distributing   corporation   stock that   actually   was   exchanged for   controlled   corporation   stoc   then   had_received   the   boot   in  exchange   for distributin   ation   stock   equal in value   to the   boot.198  Whether   or   not   this   hypothetical   redemption   results   in   a   dividend   is  tested   by   comparing   the   shareholder’s   percentage   ownership   in   the  distributing   corporation   before the transaction   with the interest the  that   corporation’s   separate affiliated group are treated as one corporation.   Prop.   Reg. § 1.855—  3(b)(3) (ii).  194   Prop.   Reg.   § 1.355—3(d)(2)   Examples   18 & 20.  195 [.R.C. § 356(b).

See also Commissioner v. Clark,   489 U.S.   726,   109 S.Ct.  1455 (1989), which uses a similar approach in testing for dividend   equivalence in acquisitive reorganizations   where   T  shareholders receive   boot. For discussion of the Service’s approach, see  Steinberg,   “Selected   Issues in  the Taxation of  Section   355   Transactions,”   52 Tax   Law. 7, 11-16 (1997). The   author   suggests   that Revenue   Ruling   93-62,   while   purporting  to follow  the  Supreme Court’s   approach to dividend   equivalence in   Clark,   actually is inconsistent   with   Clark s  “postreorganization”   approach   insofar   as  the   ruling   treats   the boot   as having   been   received in a  hypothetical   redemption   occurring prior  to  the   split-off.  503

Any loss  realized by a shareholder in a—Section—855 exchange may not be recognized.199 _  Basis   and   Holding   Period.   Section   358   again   governs   the basis   of the  boot   and   nonrecognition   property   received   in the   distribution.   The   boot takes   a fair   market   value   basis   and   its holding   period   commences   as   of the   date   of the   distribution.2°°   The   aggregate   basis   of the   nonrecognition  property   (i.e., stock   and   securities)   is the   same as the   basis of the-stock  or securities   of the   distributing   corporation   plus   any   gain recognized   and  less any   cash and the fair market   value-of- any-boot property   received   in  the   exchange.20!   That   aggregate   basis   is then   allocated among   the old  and new stock   or securities   (or the new   stock   or securities,   in the case of  a split-up) in proportion to their relative   fair market   values.2?   Similar   to  the   approach   used   for acquisitive   reorganizations,   if the   “old   stock”   was acquired   at   different   times   or   for   different   prices,   the   distributee  shareholders   generally   must   trace   their bases   in the various   blocks   of old  stock   (rather   than   using an   average   basis)   in determining   the basis   of the new   stock   under   Section   358.   If tracing   is impossible,   the   taxpayer   may designate   how   the   Section   358   basis   is to be   allocated   to the   new   stock received   in a manner   that   minimizes   the   disparity   in holding   periods   of the   surrendered   shares   to any   particular   share   of stock   received.203   The  nonrecognition   property   ordinarily   is   eligible   for   a   tacked   holding  period.204  Revenue   Ruling   93-62  1993-2   Cum.

ISSUE  Whether gain recognized on the   receipt of cash in an exchange of stock   that otherwise qualifies under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code is treated as a dividend distribution under section   356(a)(2).  FACTS  Distributing is a corporation   with   1,000 shares of a single   class   of stock outstanding. Each share   has a fair market value of $lx. A,  one of  five unrelated   individual   shareholders,   owns 400   shares of Distributing  stock. Distributing   owns all of  the outstanding stock of a subsidiary  199   T.R.C.   § 856(c). 200   T.R.C.   § 358(a)(2). 201   ‘T.R.C.   § 358(a)(1). inch LR.C. § 358(b)(2),   (c); Reg.   § 1.358-2.

In the aes iye   held companies,   the date   selected   ordinarily   is the first day that the stock   of the rolled   corporation   was   traded   on a   listed   h   ‘   ibiliti   j  Re   te   esti   isted   exchange.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 505  corporation, Controlled. The Controlled stock has a fair market value of  $200x.  Distributing distributes all the   stock of Controlled plus $200x cash to A in exchange for all of A’s Distributing stock. The exchange satisfies the requirements of section 355   but for the  receipt of the cash.  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Section   355(a)(1)   of   the   code   provides,   in   general,   that   the  shareholders   of a distributing   corporation   will not   recognize   gain   or loss on the exchange   of the distributing   corporation’s   stock   or securities   solely for   stock   or   securities   of a   controlled   subsidiary   if the   requirements   of  section   355   are   satisfied.  Section   356(a)(1)   of the   Code   provides   for   recognition   of   gain   on  exchanges   in which   gain would   otherwise   not be recognized   under   section 354   (relating   to tax-free   acquisitive   reorganizations)   or section   355   if the  property   received   in   the   exchange   consists   of property   permitted   to be received   without   gain   recognition   and   other   property   or   money   (“boot”). The   amount   of gain   recognized   is limited   to the   sum   of the   money   and the   fair market   value   of the   other   property. Under   section   356(a)(2)   of the   Code,   gain recognized   in an   exchange described   in section   356(a)(1)   that   “has   the   effect   of the   distribution   of a  dividend”   is treated   as a dividend   to the extent   of the distributee’s   ratable share   of   the   undistributed   earnings   and   profits   accumulated   after  February   28,   1913.   Any   remaining   gain   is   treated   as   gain   from   the  exchange   of property.  Determinations   of whether   the   receipt   of boot   has   the   effect   of a  dividend   are   made   by applying   the   principles   of section   302   of the   Code.  Commissioner   v. Clark,   489   U.S.   726   (1989),   1989-2   C.B.   68.   Section   302  contains   rules   for determining   whether   payments   in redemption   of stock  are   treated   as   payments   in exchange   for the   stock   or   as   distributions   to which   section   301   applies. Under   section   302(a)   of the   Code,   a redemption   will be treated   as   an  exchange   if it satisfies   one   of the tests   of section   302(b).   Section   302(b)(2)  provides   exchange   treatment   for   substantially   disproportionate redemptions   of stock.   A   distribution   is substantially   disproportionate   if  (1) the   shareholder’s   voting   stock   interest   and   common   stock   interest   in  the   corporation   immediately   after   the   redemption   are   each   less   than   80 percent   of those   interests   immediately   before   the redemption,   and   (2) the  shareholder   owns   less   than   50 percent   of the   voting   power   of all classes  ‘of stock   immediately   after   the redemption. In   Clark,   the Supreme Court   determined   whether gain   recognized under section   356   of  the Code on   the   receipt   of  boot   in   an   acquisitive  reorganization   under section   368(a)(1)(A)   and (a)(2)(D)   should   be treated  as   a dividend   distribution.   In that   case,   the   sole shareholder of the target  corporation   exchanged his   target   stock   for   stock   of   the   acquiring corporation   and   cash.   In  applying   section   302   to  determine   whether   the

--- Page 576 ---

506  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  boot payment had the effect of a dividend distribution,   the Court  considered whether section 302 should be applied to the boot payment as if it were made (i) by the target corporation in a prereorganization  hypothetical redemption of a portion of the shareholder’s target stock, or  (ii) by the acquiring   corporation in a postreorganization   hypothetical redemption of the acquiring   corporation stock that the shareholder would  have received in the reorganization exchange if there had   been no boot  distribution. The   Supreme   Court   stated   that   the   treatment   of boot   under   section 356(a)(2)   of the   Code   should   be   determined   “by   examining   the   effect   of  the   exchange   as   a   whole,”   and   concluded   that   treating   the   boot   as  received   in a redemption   of target   stock   would   improperly   isolate   the boot  payment   from   the overall   reorganization   by disregarding   the effect of the subsequent   merger.   Consequently,   the   Court   tested   whether   the   boot  payment   had   the   effect   of   a   dividend   distribution   by   comparing   the interest   the taxpayer   actually   received   in the   acquiring   corporation   with  the   interest   the   taxpayer   would   have   had   if solely   stock   in the   acquiring  corporation   had   been   received   in the   reorganization   exchange.  Prior to the decision in Clark,   the Service considered the facts and  issue presented in  this revenue ruling in Rev. Rul. 74-516, 1974-2 C.B. 121. The   determination of whether the exchange of Distributing stock for Controlled stock and boot under section 355 of the Code   had the effect of  a dividend distribution under section   356(a)(2) was made by comparing A’s interest in Distributing prior to the exchange with the   interest A  would   have retained if A had not received Controlled stock and   had only  surrendered the Distributing stock equal in value to the boot. The Court’s decision in Clark does not change the conclusion in Rev. Rul. 74-516, because, like Clark,   the ruling determined   whether the exchange in  question had the effect of a dividend distribution based on an analysis of the overall transaction.  The   exchange of   A’s Distributing stock for stock of Controlled qualifies for nonrecognition   treatment   under section 355 of the Code in  part because the   overall effect of the exchange is an adjustment of  A’s continuing interest in Distributing in a modified   corporate form. See  section   1.355—2(c) of the Income   Tax   Regulations. The   Controlled stock  received by A represents a continuing interest in a portion of  Distributing’s   assets   that were   formerly held by A as an   indirect equity interest. The boot payment has   reduced A’s proportionate interest in the overall corporate   enterprise   that   includes   both   Distributing   and Controlled.   Thus, the   boot is treated as received in redemption of  A’s Distributing stock, and A’s   interest   in Distributing immediately before  the exchange is compared to the   interest A  would   have   retained if A  had  surrendered   only  the Distributing   shares   equal in value to the  boot.  Under the  facts presented   here,   before   the   exchange,   A  owned   400   of  the   1,000   shares, or 40 percent,   of  the   outstanding   Distributing   stock.   If A  had   surrendered   only the  200   shares   for which  A received   boot,   A  would

--- Page 577 ---

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS   507  still hold 200 of the 800 shares, or 25   percent, of the Distributing stock  outstanding after the exchange. This 25 percent stock   interest would represent 62.5 percent of A’s preexchange stock   interest in Distributing.  Therefore, the deemed redemption would be   treated as an exchange  because it qualifies as substantially disproportionate under section  302(b)(2) of the Code.  HOLDING  In an exchange of stock   that otherwise qualifies under section 355 of the Code, whether the payment of boot is treated as a dividend  distribution under section   356(a)(2) is determined prior to the exchange.  This determination is made by treating the recipient shareholder as if  the shareholder   had retained the distributing corporation stock actually exchanged for controlled corporation stock and received the   boot in exchange for distributing corporation stock equal in value to the boot.  EFFECT   ON   OTHER   RULINGS  Rev.   Rul.   74-516   is superseded.  3.   CONSEQUENCE   STRIBUTING   AND  CONTROLLED   TIONS  Nonrecognition   of Gain   or Loss:   General   Rules.   The   tax consequences  to the   distributing   corporation   in a Section   355   transaction   initially   are  determined   by Section   361(c)   if the   distribution   is preceded   by a Type   D  reorganization   and by Section   355(c)   if it is not.   In either   case,   the results  generally   are   the same.   If a Section   355   transaction   occurs   1n conjunction  with   certain   changes   in   shareholder   ownership,   the   distributing  corporation   also   may   be   required   to   recognize   gain   under   Section  355(d).205  If a   Section   355   distribution   ispart   of a reorganization   plan—i.e.,  where   the   distributing   corporation   first   transfers   property   to   the controlled   corporation—no   gain   or   loss   is recognized   if the   property   is  contributed   solely   in   exchange   for   stock   or   securities   of the   controlled corporation.2°6   The   distributing   corporation   recognizes   gain,   however,   if  the liabilities   assumed by the controlléd   corporation exceed the aggregate  adjusted basis   of  the transferred   property or  if  it otherwise receives   boot that   is not distributed to shareholders or  creditors~as part of   the  reorganization plan.207  The distributing   corporation also does not-reeegnize-gain-on the _distribution to its shareholders of  “qualified   property’—1.e.,   stock or debt  6 Se   Oe Le ee ee  205   See   Section   E1   of this chapter,   infra.  206   T.R.C.   §§ 368(a)(1)(D);   361(a).  207 T.R.C.   §§  357(c),   361(b). The   amount of   cash   and   property   that a distributing corporation   may distribute to   creditors   without   gain   recognition is limited   to the   aggregate  adjusted   basis   of   the   assets   contributed to   the   controlled   corporation in the   Type   D  reorganization.

508  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  obligations of the controlled   corporation.?°* Thus, in the typical   spin-off  or split-off, where the distributing   corporation’s basis in the   stock of the  controlled corporation is less than its fair market value, no corporate- level gain is recognized on the   distribution. Section 311(b), which  otherwise might have required gain recognition, is not applicable because it only applies to distributions under Subpart A of Subchapter C (Sections  301-307), and Section   355 is not within that portion of the Code.2 The  same result occurs on a split-up. Section 336, which otherwise might have required the recognition of corporate-level   gain on a _ liquidating distribution, does not apply to distributions that are part of a reorganization.2!0 Gain is recognized, however, in the rare case where  appreciated boot is distributed in a Section   355 transaction that is part  of a reorganization.?11 If the   distribution   is not   preceded   by a Type   D   reorganization—e.g., where   the   controlled   corporation   is   not   a   newly   formed   subsidiary— Section   355(c)   determines   the   tax   consequences   of   all   forms   of divisions,?12_   providing   generally   that   the   distributing   corporation recognizes   no   gain   or   loss   on   any   distribution   to   which   Section   355  applies.213   Gain   must   be   recognized,   however,   on   a   distribution   of appreciated   property   other   than   “qualified   property,”—1.e.,   other   than stock   or   securities   in the   controlled   corporation.2!4   Thus,   no   gain   will be  recognized   on   a   distribution   of   stock   or   securities   of   the   controlled corporation   in   a   qualifying   corporate   division   even   if   the   recipient  shareholder   is taxed,?15   but   gain   is recognized   on   a   distribution   of any  other   appreciated   boot.216 Recognition of Gain on Certain Disqualified Distributions. The  general nonrecognition rule   in Section 355(c) does not apply if the distributing corporation makes a “disqualified   distribution” of  “disqualified   stock” within the meaning of Section 355(d).   In   general, a  disqualified   distribution is any distribution of stock or securities of a  controlled subsidiary (“S”) if, immediately after the   distribution, any person holds a 50 percent or greater interest in either   the distributing corporation or the controlled subsidiary and that   interest   consists   of “disqualified stock,” which is defined   generally as any stock acquired by  208   7.R.C.   § 361(c)(1),   (2).  209   See   also   L.R.C.   § 361(c)(4). 210 T.R.C. § 361(c)(4);   see   also § 336(c).

The definition   of   “qualified   property” in Section   355(c)(2)(B) is somewhat narrower   than   the   one   used to define   the same   term in  Section 361(c)(2)(B), where  qualified   property”   includes   both   rights to acquire   stock and   nonsecurity   debt   obligations.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  “purchase” within the five-year period preceding the  distribution.217 This rule, which is designed to prevent the use of Section 355 to facilitate the  tax-free sale of part of a business following a takeover (and in related  transactions), is discussed later in the chapter,?!8 as is Section 355(e),  which taxes the distributing corporation on distributions of controlled  corporation stock in certain   situations where as part of a “plan” a 50- percent or greater interest in either the distributing or controlled  corporations   was   acquired within   two years before or after the  distribution.?19 Carryover   of Tax   Attributes.   The   method   of allocating   the   earnings  and   profits   of the   various   parties   to a corporate   division   depends   on   the form   of   the   transaction.   If   a   division   is   preceded   by   a   Type   D  reorganization,   the   earnings   and   profits   of the   distributing   corporation are   allocated   between   the   distributing   and   controlled   corporations   in  proportion   to   the   relative   fair   market   values   of the   assets   retained   by  each   corporation.22°   If   the   division   is   not   preceded   by   a   Type   D  reorganization—e.g.,   where   the   stock   of   a   preexisting   subsidiary   or  subsidiaries   is   distributed—the   regulations   provide   methods   for determining   the   decrease   in the   distributing   corporation’s   earnings   and profits.221   In no   event   may   any   deficit   of the   distributing   corporation   be  allocated   to the   controlled   corporation.?22  Earnings   and   profits   are   the   only   tax   attributes   affected   by   a corporate   division.   The   carryover   rules   of Section   381   relating   to other tax   attributes   are   not   applicable   to divisive   reorganizations,   and thus   the  tax   history   of the   distributing   corporation   will remain   intact   in a spin-off  or   a split-off.   Since   a split-up   involves   the   liquidation   of the   distributing  corporation,   its   tax   attributes   will   disappear   as   a   result   of   the  transaction.223  4.   CONSEQUENCES   OF   FAILED   DIVISIONS  If a   corporate   division   fails   to   qualify   under   Section   355,   the   tax consequences   depend   on   the   form   of the   transaction.   If the   defective  division   is preceded   by the formation   of a new   corporation,   that formation  still   qualifies   for   nonrecognition—but   under   Section   351   rather   than Section   368(a)(1)(D).?24  217   T_.R.C.   § 355(d)(2)—(5).  218   See   Section   E1   of this chapter,   infra.  219   See   Section   E2   of this   chapter,   infra.  220 [.R.C. § 312(h);   Reg. § 1.312-10(a).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 511  corporate division totally or partially qualifies under Section   355 and then  that it fails to qualify.  E. USE OF SECTION 355 IN CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS  1. LIMITATIONS ON USE OF SECTION 355 IN TAXABLE  ACQUISITIONS  a.   INTRODUCTION  The   repeal of the   General   Utilities   doctrine   led tax advisors   to search for new   techniques   to avoid   corporate-level   gain on   the   sale   of all or part  of a business.   In one   common   transactional   pattern,   acorporate   buyer   of  a controlling   stock   interest   in a target   corporation   may   seek   to dispose   of unwanted   pieces   of the target,   perhaps   to help finance   the   acquisition   or maximize   overall   shareholder   value.   The   tax goal is to consummate   those dispositions   without   recognizing   gain.   After   Congress   blocked   several other   promising   techniques,   taxpayers   turned   to Section   355   to facilitate tax-free   sales   of unwanted   assets   in corporate   solution.   Congress   reacted by curtailing   the   benefits   of nonrecognition   for certain   transactions   that  previously   would   have   qualified   as   tax-free   divisions.   These   anti- avoidance   limitations,   which   were   previewed   earlier   in this   chapter,   are best   explained   in   the   context   of the   transactions   at   which   they   were  directed.  b.   DISPOSITIONS   OF   RECENTLY   ACQUIRED   BUSINESSES  Code:   § 355(a)(2)(D). Congress’s   first   line   of   attack   was   to   amend   the   active   trade   or business   requirement   in   Section   355(b)(2)(D)   in   order   to   prevent   a purchasing   corporation   (“P”)   that   had   recently   acquired   a   controlling stock   interest   in   a   target   corporation   (“T”)   from   disposing   of a   target subsidiary   (“S”)   without   paying   a   corporate-level   tax.   To   illustrate   the  prototype   transaction   at   which   this   rule   is   aimed,   assume   that   P  purchases   all   the   stock   of T, which   has   engaged   directly   in   the   active conduct   of a trade   or business   for more   than   five years.   T owns   the   stock of S, which   also   has   engaged   in the   active   conduct   of a trade   or business for the   requisite   five-year   period.   Both   T and   S have   highly   appreciated assets.   P does not make   a Section   338 election   when   it purchases   T’s stock  and,   as   a   result,   T and S retain   their   historic   asset   bases.   P intends   to  dispose   of S shortly after the takeover   of T.  At   one   time,   the   parties   could   have   used a two-step   transaction to  sell S  without   recognizing gain. T would first distribute   the S stock to P in a tax-free   distribution   under   Section   355.227 The   Service   ruled   that  227 To   avoid   problems   under   the   continuity   of  interest   doctrine, P   needed to hold  the  T stock   for a respectable   period   of  time   (two   years   was   considered   safest)   to become a  “historic” shareholder   of T.  See   Section   C2   of this  chapter,   supra.

512  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  such   a   distribution   qualified   as   tax-free   and   did   not   violate   the   active trade   or   business   requirement   unless   P   attempted   a   bailout   by distributing   the   S stock   to its shareholders.?28   P would   allocate   the   cost basis   in its T stock   under   Section   358 between   the T stock   and   the S stock it received   in the   distribution,   obtaining   essentially   a fair   market   value  basis   in the   stock   of both   corporations.?29   After   a respectable   interval,   P  then   would   sell   the   S   stock   without   recognition   of any   corporate-level gain by S. Although   the new   buyer   would   take a cost basis   in the   S stock,  S would   retain   its historic   lower   asset   bases.   This   is noteworthy   because  the   gain   inherent   in   S’s   assets   was   not   avoided   by   this   technique;   it  merely   was   deferred.   Moreover,   that   gain   did   not   accrue   while   P owned T (and   thus   indirectly   S), and   any   economic   gain   that   did   accrue   during P’s ownership   would   be taxed   on   P’s sale   of the   S stock.230 Section   355(b)(2)(D)   forecloses   this   strategy   by   providing   that   the active   trade   or   business   requirement   is not   met   if control   (as measured by the   80   percent   tests   in Section   368(c))   of the   distributing   corporation (T) was   acquired   by a corporate   distributee   (P) within   the five-year   period preceding   the   distribution   of stock   in the   controlled   corporation   (S). The limitation   does   not   apply,   however,   if P acquired   T in a wholly   tax-free transaction,   such   as   an   acquisitive   reorganization.231   Distributee  corporations   that   are   members   of the same   affiliated   group   (as defined   in  Section   1504(a))   are   treated   as   a   single   corporate   distributee   for   this  purpose.?232  The principal sanction from denying Section   355 treatment to the above fact pattern is that T must recognize   gain on the distribution of its S stock to P. In addition, assuming that T has ample earnings   and profits, P has a dividend on receipt of the S stock, but as a corporate   parent of T, P likely would be entitled to a 100 percent   dividends   received  228 Rev. Rul. 74-5, 1974-1 C.B. 82. The   key to the ruling was that T (the distributing corporation) and S (the  controlled corporation)   both had   been engaged in the   active conduct of a trade or business   for five years. It did   not matter that P (the distributee shareholder of T) had  acquired a controlling interest   in T in a taxable   transaction   within the  five-year   period preceding  the   distribution.  Syst pe A ie obtained a basis in the S stock   that usually   was significantly higher   than T’s asis in the 8 stock.   T’s basis would   disappear if the   spin-off   qualified under Section 355  LR.C.  §§ 332;  336(e); 338(h)(10). emer!  280 Of course, T could not have sold its S stock without   recognizing at least one level   of  gain. Query   whether   P should   be  able to avoid   gain on a sale   of a piece of  T’s business when T  could not have   done so. On the   other   hand, no corporate-level   gain was   recognized when T’s  through   transferred asset   bases.  731 T.R.C. § 355(b)(2)(D)(ii);   see   also   Rev.   Rul. 89-37,   1989-1 C.B.   107.  232 Thus, if in  the example   P  had   two   existing wholly owned subsidiari  each   acquired   50   percent of  the T stock for cash, a ditahaeca by  T of RN   ie ae ae,  years   after the  acquisition   would not  qualify under   Section   355   because   X  and Y,   as members of  the  same affiliated   sroup,   are   treated as   a single   corporation   that   acquired a controll   tock  interest in T  within five  years   preceding   the   distribution.   biskoais

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS 513  deduction.?33 P would obtain a fair market value basis in the distributed S stock?54 and thus recognize no further   gain on the subsequent sale. But  in the likely event that   the buyer of the S stock does not make a Section 338 election, the gain inherent in S’s assets is preserved through their  transferred bases,   raising the specter of yet another corporate-level tax.235  PROBLEM  T Corporation   (“T”) and   its wholly   owned   subsidiary,   S Corporation   (“S”)  each   have   actively   conducted   a trade   or business   for more   than   five years.   P Corporation   (“P”)   wishes   to   acquire   T   but   is not   interested   in   owning   the  business   conducted   by   S. The   assets   of T   (including   its   S stock)   and   S are highly   appreciated,   and   the   businesses   operated   by   T   and   S   are   equal   in  value.   Consider   generally   the   tax   consequences   of the   following   alternative  transactions:  (a)   T sells its S stock   to Buyer   Corporation.   T’s shareholders   then  sell their   T stock   to P.  (b)   In 2018,   P purchases   all of T’s stock   from   T’s shareholders   for cash   and   does   not   make   a Section   338   election.   In   2020,   for a  valid   business   purpose,   T distributes   its S stock   to P and   nine  months   later   P sells   the   S stock   to Buyer   Corporation.  (c)   Same   as   (b), above,   except   that   P is an   individual.  (d)   Same   as   (b), above,   except   that   P acquired   all the   stock   of T in a tax-free   Type   B reorganization.  (e)   In 2018,   P purchases   50%   of the T stock   from   T’s shareholders  and   Buyer   Corporation   (“B”) purchases   the remaining   50%.   In  2020,   T distributes   all of its S stock   to B in exchange   for all the T stock   held   by B.  c. DIVISIVE TRANSACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP  Code:   § 355(c),   (d).  The active business requirement   may disqualify a divisive transaction if P acquires a controlling   stock   interest in T within the five  years preceding the   distribution of S stock.?36 The   requirement does   not apply, however, in some other   situations   that offer promising   avenues of  233   1. R.C. § 243(a)(3), (b). If P, T and   S were members of a consolidated group,   the dividend  _would be  deferred   and P’s basis in its T stock would be reduced   by the amount of the  distribution.  Reg. §§ 1.1502-14(a)(1);   1.1502-32(b)(2).  234   T.R.C.   § 301(d). 235 This   double   corporate-level   tax  could   be  avoided if T sold its S stock   directly to the new  buyer,   and the   parties   jointly made an   election under   Section   338(h)(10).   In  that   event, T  could  ignore   the   gain   on   the   sale   of its S stock   but   S would   recognize   gain   on a deemed sale   of its assets, and   “new S” would   obtain a stepped-up basis   in  those   assets. See Chapter 8C3,   supra. Query   why the   result is worse   in  a comparable   transaction   caught   by the   Section   355(b)(2)(D)  trap?  236   T.R.C.   § 355(b)(2)(D).

514   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  escape   from   corporate-level   tax   in ostensibly   divisive   transactions   that  are   really   sales.   For   example,   if P   did   not   acquire   a   controlling   stock  interest   in   T,   the   active   business   limitation   would   not   preclude  essentially   the   same   transaction   described   in   the   example   above.   This opportunity   may   be   illustrated   through   a   simple   fact   pattern   in which  four   unrelated   corporations   (A, B,   C and   D)   each   purchase   a portion   of  the   stock   of T with   the   ultimate   objective   of winding   up   with   different  pieces of T’s business   that are   conducted   through   separate   T subsidiaries. After   waiting   two   years   to establish   their   status   as   historic   shareholders  for continuity   of interest   purposes,   A,   B   and   C   could   exchange   their   T stock for stock   of the desired   T subsidiary   in a split-off that   would   qualify under   Section   355.287   All   of this   could   be   accomplished   without   waiting five   years   after   the   acquisition   of   T   because   no   single   corporate distributee   acquired   a   controlling   stock   interest   in   T.   The   five-year holding   period   requirement   also   does   not   apply   to   acquisitions   of   a  controlling   interest   in   T   through   a   partnership   or   by   any   other  noncorporate   purchaser.   A variety   of other   avoidance   techniques   quickly  revealed   that   Congress   had   not   successfully   curtailed   the   use   of Section 355   to avoid   corporate-level   gain   on   essentially   acquisitive   transactions. The   Treasury   might have   attacked a Section   355 transaction that was inconsistent   with General Utilities repeal by exercising its authority  to issue regulations under Section 337(d).238 Instead, it returned to  Congress for a more comprehensive solution. The result is Section 355(d),  which   imposes a corporate-level tax on divisive transactions in  connection   with certain changes of ownership.   The House Ways and  Means   Committee explained the reasons for the change:239  Some corporate taxpayers may attempt, under   present-law  rules governing divisive transactions, to dispose of subsidiaries  in transactions that resemble sales, or to obtain a fair market  value stepped-up basis for any future   dispositions, without incurring   corporate-level tax. The   avoidance of corporate-level tax is inconsistent   with the repeal of the General Utilities  doctrine as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Under the present-law rules, individual purchasers, or  corporate purchasers of  less than 80   percent, of the   stock of a  parent   corporation may attempt to utilize section 355 to acquire  a subsidiary (or a division incorporated for   this purpose)   from the parent   without the parent   incurring   any   corporate-level tax.  *87 For this purpose, it is assumed that all relevant   business of T  have a five-year   history;  the business   purpose   requirement can   be satisfied: i ied; and the   parties   could   structure   th transaction to avoid   the   step transaction   doctrine. : ee Section   337(d)   grants   the   Service   authority to promulgate regulations to prevent circumvention of  the purposes of  certain amendments   made   by The   Tax   Reform Act of 1986 (i.e.  me the   General Utilities doctrine) through the   use   of any   provision of   the Code   or  regulations.  289 House   Ways   and   Means   Committee,   Ex   l i isi Wa , Explanation   of  the Revenue Pro  Budget   Reconciliation Bill   (Oct.   16,   1990),   101st   Cong.,   2d   Sess. 90-92   (1990). has ae

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS The   purchaser may acquire stock of the parent equal in value to  the value of the desired subsidiary or division, and later  surrender that   stock for stock of the subsidiary, in a transaction  intended to qualify as   a non pro-rata tax-free divisive  transaction.   Alternatively, the transaction might be structured as a surrender of the parent stock by all shareholders other than  the acquiror, in exchange for a distribution (intended to be tax-  free) of all subsidiaries or activities other than those the  acquiror desires.  In   addition,   a   noncorporate   purchaser,   or   a   corporate  purchaser   of   less   than   80   percent   of   the   stock   of   another  corporation,   may   attempt   to   utilize   section   355   to   obtain   a stepped   up fair market   value   basis   in a subsidiary   of an   acquired  corporation,   enabling   a   subsequent   disposition   of   that subsidiary   without   a corporate-level   tax. The   provisions   for   tax-free   divisive   transactions   under section   355   were   a limited   exception   to the repeal   of the   General Utilities   doctrine,   intended   to   permit   historic   shareholders   to  continue   to   carry   on   their   historic   corporate   businesses   in  separate   corporations.   It is believed   that   the   benefit   of tax-free  treatment   should   not   apply   where   the   divisive   transaction,  combined   with   a   stock   purchase   resulting   in   a   change   of  ownership,   in   effect   results   in   the   disposition   of a   significant part   of the   historic   shareholders’   interests   in one   or more   of the  divided   corporations.  The   present-law   provisions   granting   tax-free   treatment   at  the   corporate   level   are   particularly   troublesome   because   they may   offer   taxpayers   an   opportunity   to   avoid   the   general   rule that   corporate-level   gain is recognized   when   an   asset   (including the   stock   of a subsidiary)   is disposed   of. There   is special concern  about   the   possibility   for   the   distributing   corporation   to   avoid corporate-level   tax   on   the   transfer   of a   subsidiary.   Therefore,  although   the   provision   does   not   affect   shareholder   treatment   if  section   355   is   otherwise   available,   it   does   impose   tax   at   the  corporate   level,   in light   of the   potential   avoidance   of corporate tax   on   what   is in effect   a sale of a subsidiary. The bill  is not intended to limit   in any way the continuing  Treasury   Department authority to issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of   the   repeal of  the General Utilities doctrine  through   any   provision of law or regulations,   including   Section 355.  Because   Section   355(d)   attempts to reach   such a wide   range of transactions, its operation is complex.   Very   generally,   Section   355(d)  requires   recognition   of  gain  by  the   distributing   corporation   (but   not   the  distributee   shareholders)   on   a   “disqualified   distribution”   of   stock or securities   of   a   controlled   corporation   regardless   of   whether   the  515

516  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  distribution   is part of a reorganization.24°   A “disqualified   distribution”   is  any   Section   355   distribution   if, immediately   after   the   distribution,   any person   holds   “disqualified   stock”   in either   the   distributing   corporation   or any   distributed   controlled   corporation   constituting   a   50   percent   or greater   interest   (measured   by total   combined   voting   power   or   value)   in  such   corporation.?4!   “Disqualified   stock”   includes:   (1) any   stock   in either the   distributing   corporation   or   any   controlled   corporation   acquired   after  October   9,   1990   by   purchase   during   the   five-year   period   before   the  distribution,   and   (2) any   stock   in any   controlled   corporation   received   in a  distribution   attributable   to   stock   in   the   distributing   corporation described   in (1).?42 In effect,   Section   355(d)   creates   a five-year   statutory   predistribution  continuity   of interest   test.   If violated,   the   test   requires   the   distributing corporation   to recognize   gain   on   the   distribution   of stock   or   securities   of  a subsidiary   to a person   who   ends   up with   50 percent   or more   of the stock of the   subsidiary.   Some   typical   examples   of the   application   of Section 355(d)   are   illustrated   by   the   following   excerpt   from   the   legislative  history:243  Example 1. Assume that after the effective   date,  individual A acquires by  purchase a 20-percent interest in the stock of corporation P  and a 10-percent interest in the   stock of its subsidiary, S, and 40 percent or more of the   stock of § is  distributed to A within 5  years in exchange for his 20-percent interest in P. (The remainder of the S stock distributed in the  section 355   distribution is distributed to other shareholders).  Under the provision P must recognize   gain with   respect to the  distributed stock of S  because all 50 percent of the   stock of S held by A is disqualified stock.  Example 2. Assume that after the effective date  individual A acquires by   purchase a 20-percent interest in  corporation P and   P  redeems stock of other shareholders so that A’s interest in P increases to a 30 percent interest. Within 5 years of  A’s purchase, P distributes   50 percent of the   stock of its  subsidiary, S, to A in exchange for his 30 percent interest in P (the remainder of the   stock of S distributed in the   section 355  transaction is distributed to the   other   shareholders). P recognizes   gain on   the distribution of the   stock of S because all  50 percent of the   stock of S held by A is disqualified stock.  4aV IRC.   § 355(d)(2).  LR.C. § 355(d)(3).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  For purposes of the definition of disqualified stock, stock or securities  generally are considered   acquired by “purchase” if they do not have either  a transferred basis or   a Section 1014   date-of-death basis, and were not  acquired in an exchange to which Section   351 or the corporate reorganization provisions apply.244 An acquisition of property in a Section   351 exchange,   however, is considered a purchase to the extent such property is acquired for cash or   a cash item, marketable stock or  securities, or any debt of the   transferor.?45   In the case of carryover basis property which was purchased   by the   transferor,   the acquirer of the  property is treated as having purchased the property on the   date it was purchased   by the   transferor.246 This tacking rule may enable a distributing corporation to achieve purchase status and a five-year  holding period, thus avoiding the gain   triggered on a disqualified distribution.  To   prevent   easy   avoidance   of the   50 percent   or more   ownership   test,  an   array   of   aggregation   and   attribution   rules   are   applied   to   test  shareholder   ownership   after   a distribution.   First,   a shareholder   and   all  persons   related   to   the   shareholder   under   Sections   267(b)   or   707(b)   are treated   as   one   person.?47   If two   or   more   otherwise   unrelated   persons   act  pursuant   to   a   plan   or   arrangement   with   respect   to   acquisitions   of distributing   corporation   or controlled   corporation   stock or securities,   they are   treated   as   a   single   person   for purposes   of Section   355(d).248   Special rules   also   apply   to   attribution   of   stock   from   a   corporation   to   its shareholders.   The   Section   318(a)(2)   attribution   rules   apply   to both   stock and   securities   with   the   threshold   for   attribution   from   a   corporation reduced   to 10 percent.?49   In addition,   if a person   acquires   by purchase   an interest   in   an   entity   through   which   stock   or   securities   are   attributed,  such   stock   or   securities   are   deemed   purchased   on   the   later   of the   date   of  the   purchase   of   the   interest   in   the   entity   or   the   date   the   stock   or  securities   are   acquired   by purchase   by the   entity.?5° In yet another   anti-avoidance provision,   the running of the  five-year  predistribution   period for holding stock or securities is suspended during any   period in which the   holder’s risk   of loss with   respect to the   stock or securities or any   portion of the   corporation’s activities is substantially  diminished.   Such a reduction in  risk can   be accomplished   by an option in  244 1.R.C. § 355(d)(5)(A). The legislative history states   that   there will be an exception for  reorganization   exchanges in which gain is recognized on   receipt of  boot. H.Rep.

The legislative   history states   that it is expected that   regulations  “will provide an exception for Section   351 exchanges in which   such   items are transferred as part  of  an   active   trade or business   (including   debts   incurred in the ordinary   course of  the   trade or  business)   and do   not exceed the reasonable   needs of  the   business.

DISPOSITIONS   OF   UNWANTED   ASSETS   IN   CONJUNCTION  WITH   TAX-FREE   REORGANIZATIONS  Introduction.   As   discussed   earlier   in   this   chapter,   a   corporate division   may   be   used   as   the   vehicle   for   a   tax-free   spin-off   of unwanted assets   in   preparation   for   an   acquisition   of   the   rest   of   the   target  corporation’s   business.   Consider   a   typical   scenario.   An   attractive  takeover   candidate   (“I”),   engaged   in   two   different   businesses,   is approached   by a motivated   buyer   (“P”)   whose   interest   is limited   to only  one   of   those   businesses.   To   facilitate   the   transaction   and   maximize  shareholder   value,   T spins   off the   unwanted   business   to its shareholders  and   then   is acquired   by P in a tax-free   acquisitive   reorganization.   Should the   spin-off   qualify   under   Section   355?   What   if T   spins   off the   wanted  business   (“Newco”)   to its shareholders,   who   then   exchange   their   Newco  stock   for   P   stock?   Should   the   form   of   the   transaction   make   any difference?   These   and   other   scenarios   present   a challenge   to the   target corporation’s   tax   advisor   and   provide   the   student   of Subchapter   C with  an   opportunity   to   relate   the   requirements   for   a   tax-free   corporate division   to   the   acquisitive   reorganization   concepts   encountered   in   the previous   chapter.  In Commissioner v. Morris Trust,252   the Fourth Circuit held that a  spin-off of an unwanted business followed by a prearranged   merger of the parent “distributing” corporation   with an unrelated   acquiring corporation qualified as tax-free—specifically, a Type D reorganization coupled   with a Section   355   corporate division, and a Section   368 Type A acquisitive reorganization. The Service ultimately   blessed the Morris Trust form of transaction253 and even acknowledged that a spin-off to  prepare for an acquisition of a separate   business   was a valid Section   355 business   purpose,254   but it was less receptive to other   transactional patterns   despite their economic similarity. For example, a spin off of  unwanted assets followed by a Type   C reorganization or   a forward  triangular merger   was likely to be treated as an integrated   transaction, with the unfortunate result   that   the unwanted assets would be  considered in determining   whether   P transferred   substantially all of its properties in the subsequent reorganization.

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  a substantial part of P’s overall business, the acquisition would not qualify as a reorganization, and the spin-off also was unlikely to qualify  under Section 355.255 Other transactional   forms also were   vulnerable to challenge under  the   step transaction doctrine. For example, if P contributed the  assets of  a wanted business with a five-year   history to newly created S; retained  another (unwanted) business,   distributed the S stock to its shareholders,  and then S was   acquired by an unrelated corporation (“X”) in an  attempted tax-free reorganization, the Service took the position that  neither the   spin-off   nor   the reorganization qualified for tax-free  treatment. If the   steps were prearranged,   S was   disregarded   and P was  treated as having made a taxable sale   of the wanted assets to X and  having distributed the consideration received from X to P’s shareholders  as  a dividend.?56 If P was publicly traded and   S  was an “old and cold” (i.e., not newly formed) subsidiary, however, the Service   ruled that a spin-off of S stock followed by X’s acquisition of S in a Type A or Type   B reorganization did qualify as tax-free if no formal   negotiations   with respect to the subsequent acquisition   took   place prior to the spin-off.257  After   repeal   of   the   General   Utilities   doctrine,   Congress   became  concerned   (some   might   say   paranoid)   that   Section   355   was   being   used   to  avoid   corporate-level   gain   on   the   sale   of   a   business.   Section   355(d),  discussed   earlier   in   this   chapter,   was   an   early   response.   Congress  followed   up   by   enacting   Section   355(e),   which   virtually   eliminates   the  time-tested   Morris   Trust   technique.258   The   legislative   history   explains that   where   new   shareholders   acquire   ownership   of   a   business   in connection   with   a   spin-off,   the   transaction   more   closely   resembles   a taxable   corporate-level   disposition   of the   portion   of the   business   that   is acquired   rather   than   a tax-free   division   among   existing   shareholders.?59  Recognition   of   Gain   by   Distributing   Corporation:   Section   355(e).  Section   355(e)   is a   typically   complex   anti-avoidance   provision   and   this discussion   is limited   to an   overview.   It requires   the   distributing   (parent)  corporation   to recognize   gain as   if it had   sold the   stock   of the distributed controlled   subsidiary   for   its   fair   market   value   on   the   date   of   the distribution   if, as   part of a “plan”   or series   of related   transactions,   one   or  more   persons   acquire?6?   (directly   or   indirectly)   a   50-percent   or   greater  255 See, e.g., Helvering v. Elkhorn Coal Co., 95   F.2d   732 (4th   Cir.1937), cert. denied,   305  U.S.   605,   59 S.Ct.   65   (1938). But see Rev. Rul. 2003-79,   2003-2 C.B. 80.  256   Rey.

No.   105-33,   105th   Cong., 1st  Sess. 139-140 (1997).  260 Acquisitions, for this purpose, are   not   limited to  cost   basis purchase   transactions   but  also   can   include   tax-free   acquisitions.   Certain   acquisitions   that   do  not   involve a shift  in control are   disregarded.   I.R.C. § 355(e)(3)(A).   If  the   assets   rather   than   the   stock   of either   corporation  are   acquired,   the   shareholders   of the   acquiring   corporation   are   deemed to   have   acquired   the  519

520  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  interest   in   either   the   distributing   or   controlled   corporation   within   two  years   before   or   after   the   distribution.?61   Put   differently   (and,   one   hopes, more   coherently),   the   distributing   corporation   (but not   its shareholders)  must   recognize   corporate-level   gain   on   an   otherwise   tax-free   spin-off   if  “pursuant   to   a   plan”   stock   of   either   the   distributing   or   controlled  corporation   is acquired   and   the   historic   shareholders   of the   distributing  corporation   do not retain   more   than   50 percent   (by vote   and   value)   of both  corporations.   Significantly   (and   inexplicably),   neither   the   distributing nor   controlled   corporations   may   adjust   the   basis   of their   assets   or   stock  to reflect   this recognition   of Section   355(e)   gain. Plan   Requirement.   Section   355(e)   applies   only   if the   transaction   is  part   of   a   “plan”   (or   a   series   of   related   transactions)   to   acquire   the  requisite   50 percent   or greater   interest   in the target.   For   this   purpose,   if one   or more   persons   directly or indirectly   acquire   a 50-percent   or   greater interest   in   the   distributing   corporation   or   any   controlled   corporation during   the   four-year   period   beginning   two   years   before   the   distribution, the   acquisition   is presumed   to be pursuant   to a plan   unless   the taxpayer  establishes   that   such   a plan did not   exist.262   Whether   or not   a prohibited  “plan”   exists   is based   on   all the   facts   and   circumstances.263  The regulations have gone through several iterations, and the final  version provides   considerable flexibility   in making this factual  determination.264 In the  case of acquisitions (other than public offerings) of the distributing or controlled corporation after a distribution,   the distribution and acquisition will be considered as part of a plan   only if  there was an agreement,   understanding,   arrangement, or substantial  negotiations regarding the acquisition or a_ similar acquisition  (collectively referred to below as “Talks”) at some time during the   two- year   period preceding the   distribution.265 Although not labelled as   a safe  harbor, this “two   year lookback rule” operates as   a security blanket in  many situations, especially in  light   of the narrow definitions of several  critical terms. An “agreement, understanding or arrangement,” for  example, is generally   considered to exist only if the  parties have   reached a common understanding on most of the   significant terms of the transaction.?66 “Substantial   negotiations” exist only if the   significant economic   terms of the acquisition have   been   discussed at the highest  levels   (directors, officers, shareholders, or their representatives).267   In  ee ee  target   stock for purposes of determining   whether the gain-triggerin shift of t  occurred.

Technically, this result   occurs because the   stock or securities   in the  controlled  corporation is not treated as “qualified property” for purposes of Section 355(c)(2) or Section 361(c)(2), and   thus   gain is recognized on   the   distribution under Section 311(b).  762 T.R.C. § 355(e)(2)(B).  263 Reg. § 1.355—7(b)(1). 764 See   generally   Reg. § 1.355-7.  265 Reg. § 1.355-7(b)(2).  266 Reg, §  1.355—7(h) (1) (i)—Gii)  F.  267 Reg.  § 1.355-7(h)(1)(iv).

CHAPTER 10 CORPORATE DIVISIONS  short, for a plan to exist, the dealings must have   reached a fairly advanced stage. The regulations go   on to provide that, even though the existence of  Talks between the parties within the two years preceding the  distribution   “tend to show” that   the distribution and acquisition are part of a plan, all the facts and   circumstances still must be considered, and the existence of a corporate   business purpose (apart from facilitating the acquisition) will help the taxpayer rebut the statutory presumption.268  Further comfort is available from seven safe harbors.269 A key factor  under most of these safe harbors is whether there were bilateral Talks  during a specified time period. For example, if the acquisition occurred more than six months after the distribution and there were no Talks  during the period commencing one year   before and   ending six months  after the   distribution,   the transactions are not considered part of a plan  if the distribution was   motivated   by a substantial   business purpose other  than facilitating   the   acquisition.27° If a transaction does not fit within  any of the safe harbors, the regulations include a list of “plan” and  “nonplan” factors to consider in determining   whether a plan exists.271 Practical   Impact   of Section   355(e).   Section   355(e)   obliterates   many  typical   “planned”   Morris   Trust   transactions   but   leaves   open   the  possibility   that   a   spin-off   followed   by   an   acquisition   will   continue   to qualify under   Section   355   if there   was   a valid business   purpose   and Talks  with   potential   acquirers   did not occur   prior to the   distribution   and within  six months   thereafter.   On   the other   hand,   the existence   of an   agreement, understanding   or negotiations   to sell either   the   distributing   or controlled  corporations   at the   time   of the   spin-off likely will   doom   the   transaction.  In   an   ironic   twist,   Section   355(e)   would   not   have   changed   the   tax-free treatment   in   the   actual   Morris   Trust   transaction,   because   the  distributing   corporation’s   shareholders   received   54 percent   of the   equity of   the   acquiring   corporation   as   part   of the   transaction   and   thus   the  “control   shift” required   to trigger   Section   355(e) would   not have   occurred.  As   a   practical   matter,   Section   355(e)   does   not   apply   when   the   equity  value   of the   distributing   corporation   after the spin-off exceeds   that   of the  acquiring   corporation.

Consider   the   tax   consequences   of   the  following   alternative   plans   for carrying   out   the objectives   of the   parties:  (a)   Leisure   will   transfer   the   motel   assets   to   a   newly   formed subsidiary,   Motel,   Inc., and   distribute   the Motel   stock   pro   rata  to   the   Leisure   shareholders.   Leisure   then   will   transfer   the  assets   and   liabilities   of   the   apparel   business   to   Denim   in exchange   for   Denim   voting   stock   (representing   less   than   50 percent   of the total outstanding   voting stock of Denim   after the acquisition),   and   then   Leisure   will   liquidate,   distributing   the Denim   stock   pro   rata   to its shareholders.  (b)   Same   as   (a),   above,   except   that   after   the   spin-off,   Leisure merges   into   Denim.   Under   the   terms   of the   merger,   Leisure  shareholders   receive   Denim   nonvoting   preferred   stock.  (c)   What   result   if Leisure   transfers   the   apparel   business   to a new corporation,   Cords,   Inc.,   and   then   distributes   the   Cords   stock pro   rata   to   the   Leisure   shareholders.   Leisure   continues   to  operate   the motel   business,   but   Cords,   Inc.   merges   into Denim,  Inc.,   and   the   Cords   shareholders   receive   Denim   voting   stock. (d) Same as (c), above,   except that after the merger, the Denim voting stock received by Cords   shareholders   represents more  than 50 percent of the total outstanding stock of Denim.  (e) Same as (b), above,   except that   the merger of Leisure into  Denim occurred one year after the spin-off. What factors are relevant in determining   whether the transaction   was part ofa “plan” to acquire   Leisure?  (f) Same as (b), above,   except that   the business purpose for the spin-off was   unrelated to any acquisition of the apparel  business, and the merger of Leisure into Denim occurred three years after the spin-off. (g)   Is § 355(e) necessary? How did the   typical Morris Trust  transaction violate the  policy of Subchapter C?

CHAPTER   11  NONACQUISITIVE,  NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  A.   TYPE   E: RECAPITALIZATIONS  1.   INTRODUCTION  Code:   §§ 368(a)(1)(E);   354;   356;   358;   1032;   1036;   1223(1).   Skim   §§ 305;  306.  Regulations:   §§ 1.301—1(J);   1.305—7(c);   1.368—2(e). A   tax-free   reorganization   sometimes   involves   only   a _ single corporation   undergoing   a readjustment   to its capital   structure.   The   most  common   form   of   nonacquisitive,   nondivisive   reorganization   is   the recapitalization,   which   qualifies   as   a   Type   E   reorganization   if certain  requirements   are   met.   Recapitalizations   traditionally   have   been   used   for  a variety   of business   and   tax   objectives.   A corporation   may   reshuffle   its  capital   structure   by exchanging   stock   for bonds   in order   to improve   its debt/equity   ratio   and   calm   the   nerves   of creditors   or   as   a   condition   to borrowing   additional   funds.   Alternatively,   it   may   exchange   debt instruments   for   stock   in   order   to   reduce   corporate-level   tax   by   paying  deductible   interest   rather   than   nondeductible   dividends.   For closely held corporations,   recapitalizations   also   may   be   used   as   a   device   to   shift control   among   the   shareholders. Because   a recapitalization   is a nonacquisitive   transaction   involving  only   a   single   corporation,   neither   continuity   of proprietary   interest   nor  continuity   of business   enterprise   is   required   to   qualify   as   a   Type   E  reorganization.!   To   be tax   free,   however,   a recapitalization   must   serve   a  corporate   business   purpose.?   The   courts   have   been   tolerant   in this   area, and   the   business   objectives   set   forth   in   the   preceding   paragraph  generally   are   acceptable.   In   analogous   situations,   the   courts   have recognized   that   it   may   be   unrealistic   and   impractical   to   distinguish  corporate   from   shareholder   purposes   in a closely held corporation.’   Thus,  1 Rev.

524  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  shareholder objectives germane to the corporation’s business have   been  sufficient to satisfy the business purpose   requirement.*  2.   TYPES   OF   RECAPITALIZATIONS  Recapitalizations   fall into   four broad   categories   depending   upon   the  consideration   exchanged.   These   categories   raise   different   issues   and   are best   studied   separately.  a.   BONDS   EXCHANGED   FOR   STOCK  If a corporation   discharges   outstanding   bonds   by issuing   preferred  or   common   stock   to the   bondholders,   the   transaction   qualifies   as   a Type  K reorganization.®   Under   Section   354(a),   the   bondholders   generally   will recognize   no   gain or loss on   the exchange   of their   debt   instruments   solely  for stock.   Section   354(a)(2)(B)   creates   an   exception   to nonrecognition   to the   extent   stock   received   is attributable   to accrued   and   untaxed   interest on   the   bonds.   This   interest   component   will be   taxed   as   ordinary   income  under   Section   61.6   The   basis   of the   stock   received   in   a   bonds-for-stock recapitalization   will   be   determined   under   the   familiar   rules   of Section 358,   and   the   new   shareholder   will be entitled   to a tacked   holding   period  on   the   stock   under   Section   1223(1).  On the corporate side, matters are   fairly routine. Since the corporation is issuing its stock, it initially   will be excused   from recognizing   gain or loss by Section 1032. However, a debtor corporation  that transfers its stock in satisfaction of its debt is treated as if it satisfied  the   debt with an amount of money equal to the fair market value of the transferred stock.7 Only an insolvent or bankrupt corporation may exclude   any resulting discharge of indebtedness   income   under Section  108 and must make a corresponding reduction in its tax attributes. Thus, a bonds-for-stock   recapitalization may result in gross income for  the corporation. b. BONDS FOR BONDS  After initially contesting the issue, the  Service now   concedes that if a creditor exchanges   outstanding   bonds for newly issued bonds in the  4 Cf. Rafferty v. Commissioner, 452   F.2d   767 (1st Cir.1971 cert. denied, 408  92 S.Ct. 2489 (1972). Aah Vaile  us Reg. § 1.368-2(e)(1). A recapitalization   should be distinguished   from   conversion of a  bond into  stock pursuant to a conversion privilege in the bond. The Service   has   held   that   the latter situation does not constitute a taxable   event as long as the bond is converted into stock   of  the same corporation.   Rev.

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  same corporation, the transaction qualifies as a Type   E reorganization.10 The   bondholder in a bonds-for-bonds exchange generally does not  recognize gain or loss unless the bonds received are attributable to  accrued and untaxed interest!! or the principal amount of the bonds received in the exchange exceeds the principal amount of the bonds  surrendered.!2 Income attributable to interest will be ordinary in character while   gain recognized as a result of receipt of excess bonds generally will be either short-or long-term capital gain.13 The bondholder’s basis in the new bonds will be determined under Section  358 and the new bonds will take a tacked   holding period under Section  T2231),  On   the   corporate   side,   the   primary   concern   in   a   bonds-for-bonds  recapitalization   will   be   the   discharge   of indebtedness   rules   in   Section 108.14   In   addition,   a   bonds-for-bonds   recapitalization   may   subject   the corporation   and   bondholders   to   the   intricate   original   issue   discount provisions. 16  c.   STOCK   FOR   STOCK  The   regulations   provide   three   examples   of stock-for-stock   exchanges which   qualify   as   reorganizations.   Two   examples   involve   exchanges   of  outstanding   preferred   stock   for common   stock   and   the   third   involves   an exchange   of   outstanding   common   for   preferred.!6   Thus,   virtually   all equity-for-equity   exchanges   will   qualify   as   Type   E reorganizations.!7   In  addition,   exchanges   of common   stock   in a corporation   for common   stock  in the   same   corporation   or preferred   stock   for preferred   stock will qualify  for nonrecognition   under   Section   1036.18  Sections   354   and   356   govern   the   shareholder   level tax consequences of a stock-for-stock   recapitalization.   The   shareholders   will recognize   gain to   the   extent   they   receive   boot   in   the   exchange,   and   the   gain   will   be  characterized   as   gain   from   the   exchange   of   the   stock   unless   the  10   See   I.T.   4081,   1952-1   C.B.   65; Rev.   Rul.   77-415,   1977-2   C.B.   311.  uu   TLLR.C.   § 354(a)(2)(B).   Cf. I.R.C.   § 354(a)(3)(B). 12   T.R.C.   §§ 354(a)(2)(A),   356(a)(1),   (d).  13 T.R.C. §§  354(a)(3)(A),   356(a)(1).

See   Bittker & Eustice, Federal Income Taxation of Corporations   and   Shareholders § 12.27[4][c].  16   Reg.   § 1.868-2(e)(2)—(4).  17 Jt   is unlikely   that a conversion of preferred stock into common stock in the same  corporation, or vice   versa, pursuant to   a conversion privilege in the   stock would be a taxable event under the theory of  Rev.   Rul. 72-265,   1972-1 C.B.   222, which deals   with   convertible   debt  instruments. Rev.   Rul. 77-238,   1977-2 C.B.   115, however, holds   that conversion of  stock   in  furtherance of a corporate   business   purpose   pursuant to   a privilege contained in the  corporation’s certificate   of incorporation is a recapitalization   under Section   368(a)(1)(E). 18 Section   1036 also   applies to exchanges   between   two   individual   stockholders.   Reg.  § 1.1036-1(a).   For this purpose,   boot   generally   includes   “debt-like”   nonqualified   preferred   stock  within   the meaning of  Section   351(g)   unless   such   preferred   stock is exchanged for comparable preferred   of   the   same or   lesser   value,   or   in   certain   recapitalizations   of   “family-owned”  corporations.

526   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  transaction   has   “the   effect   of   the   distribution   of   a   dividend.”!9   The  shareholders’   basis   in   the   stock   received   in   the   exchange   will   be determined   under   Section   358   and   will   take   a   tacked   holding   period under   Section   1223(1).   The   corporation   will be entitled   to nonrecognition  under   Section   1032   on   the exchange   of its stock. Sections   305   and   306   also   may   come   into   play   in   a   stock-for-stock recapitalization.   The   regulations   provide   that   a recapitalization   will   be  deemed   to result   in a distribution   to which   Section   305(c)   applies   if it is  (1)   pursuant   to   a   plan   to   periodically   increase   a_shareholder’s  proportionate   interest   in   the   assets   or   earnings   and   profits   of   the  corporation   or   (2)   with   respect   to   preferred   stock   with   dividend  arrearages   and   the   preferred   shareholder   increases   his   proportionate  interest   in   the   corporation   as   a   result   of the   exchange.20   The   second  alternative   essentially   precludes   recapitalizations   designed   to   remedy  preferred   stock   dividend   arrearages   by taxing them   under   Sections   305(c)  and   (b)(4).21  Stock   received in a recapitalization   constitutes   “Section   306 stock”  under Section 306(c)(1)(B) if: (1) it is not common stock, (2) it was received  pursuant to a plan of reorganization, (3) on its receipt gain or loss was not recognized to any extent under Sections   354 and 356, and (4) the effect of the transaction   was substantially the same as the   receipt of a stock dividend or the   stock was received in exchange for Section 306  stock. The regulations   provide a cash   substitute test   for determining whether the transaction   has the effect of a dividend.22 If cash   received in lieu of the   stock obtained in the recapitalization would have   been a  dividend under Section 356(a)(2), the transaction   has   substantially the same effect as   a dividend. Thus, if the shareholders exchange common stock for common stock and a proportionate amount of preferred stock,  the preferred   shares will be  Section 306 stock.  Revenue Ruling 84-114 1984—2 Cum.

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  Internal Revenue Code, does the   receipt of cash have the effect of the  distribution of a dividend within the meaning of section 356(a)(2)?  FACTS  Corporation   X had   outstanding   420   shares   of voting   common   stock  of which   A owned   120   shares   and   B, C and   D   each   owned   100   shares.   A,  B, C and   D   were   not   related   within   the   meaning   of section   318(a)   of the  Code.   X adopted   a plan   of recapitalization   that   permitted   a shareholder to exchange   each   of 30 shares   of voting common   stock   for either one   share of   nonvoting   preferred   stock   or   cash.   Pursuant   to   the   plan,   A   first exchanged   15 shares   of voting common   stock for cash   and then   exchanged  15   shares   of voting   common   stock   for   15   shares   of nonvoting   preferred  stock.   The   facts   and   circumstances   surrounding   these   exchanges   were such   that   the   exchanges   constituted   two   steps   in   a   single   integrated  transaction   for   purposes   of   sections   368(a)(1)(EK)   and   356(a)(2).   The  nonvoting   preferred   stock   had   no   conversion   features.   In   addition,   the  dividend   and   liquidation   rights   payable   to A   on   15   shares   of nonvoting preferred   stock   were   substantially   less than   the dividend   and   liquidation rights   payable   to A on   30 shares   of voting   common   stock.   B, C, and   D did not   participate   in the   exchange   and   will   retain   all their   voting   common stock   in X. X had   a substantial   amount   of post-1913   earnings   and   profits.  The   exchange   by A   of voting   common   stock   for nonvoting   preferred stock   and   cash   qualified   as   a   recapitalization   within   the   meaning   of  section   368(a)(1)(E)   of the   Code.  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Section   354(a)(1)   of the   Code   provides   that   no   gain   or   loss   will   be recognized   if   stock   or   securities   in   a   corporation   a   party   to   a reorganization   are,   in pursuance   of the plan of reorganization,   exchanged  solely for stock   or securities   in such   corporation   or in another   corporation  a party   to the reorganization.  Section   356(a)(1)   of the Code   provides   that if section   354 would   apply  to an   exchange   but for the fact that the property   received   in the exchange consists   not   only   of property   permitted   by   section   354   to   be   received without   the recognition   of gain but   also   of other   property   or money,   then the   gain,   if any,   will be recognized,   but in an   amount   not   in excess   of the  sum   of the   money   and   fair   market   value   of the   other   property.   Section  356(a)(2)   provides   that   if such   exchange   has   the effect of the distribution of a   dividend   (determined   with   the   application   of section   318(a)),   then  there   will be treated   as   a dividend   to each   distributee   such   an   amount   of the   gain   recognized   under   section   356(a)(1)   as   is not   in   excess   of each  distributee’s   ratable   share   of the   undistributed   earnings   and   profits   of  the   corporation   accumulated   after   February   28,   1913. Under section   302(b)(1)   and   section   302(a)   of  the   Code a redemption will   be treated as   a distribution   in  part or   full payment in exchange for stock   if it  is  not   essentially   equivalent to a dividend to  the   shareholder.  527

528  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Rev.   Rul.   74-515,   1974-2   C.B.   118,   and   Rev.   Rul.   74-516,   1974-2  C.B.   121,   state   that   whether   a   reorganization   distribution   to   which  section   356   of the   Code   applies   has   the   effect   of a   dividend   must   be  determined   by examining   the   facts   and   circumstances   surrounding   the  distribution   and   looking   to   the   principles   for   determining   dividend  equivalency   developed   under   section   356(a)(2)   and   other   provisions   of the Code.   See   Ross   v.   United   States,   173   F.Supp.   793   (Ct.Cl.1959),   cert. denied,   361   U.S.   875   (1959).   Rev.   Rul.   74-516   indicates   that   in making   a dividend   equivalency   determination   under   section   356(a)(2),   it is proper  to analogize   to section   302   in appropriate   cases.   In   Shimberg   v.   United  States,   577   F.2d   283   (5th   Cir.1978),   cert.   denied,   489   U.S.   1115   (1979),  the   courts   indicated   that   in   making   a _ dividend   equivalency  determination   under   section   356(a)(2),   an   analogy   to section   302   may   be  appropriate   in cases   involving   single   entity   reorganizations.  In United   States   v. Davis,   397   U.S.   301   (1970),   rehearing   denied,   397  U.S.   1071   (1970),   1970-1   C.B.   62,   the   Supreme   Court   of the   United  States   held   that   a redemption   must   result   in a meaningful   reduction   of  the   shareholder’s   proportionate   interest   in the   corporation   in order   not  to be   essentially equivalent to a dividend under section   302(b)(1) of the Code.  Rev. Rul. 75-502, 1975-2 C.B.   111, sets forth  factors to be considered in determining   whether a reduction in a shareholder’s proportionate  interest in a corporation is meaningful within the meaning of Davis. The factors considered are a shareholder’s right to vote and exercise control, to participate in current earnings   and accumulated surplus, and to share in net   assets on liquidation. The reduction in the   right to vote is of particular   significance when a redemption causes a redeemed  shareholder to lose the potential for controlling   the redeeming  corporation by acting in concert with   only one other shareholder.   See  Rev.Rul.   76-364, 1976-2 C.B. 91.  The specific issue is whether, in determining dividend   equivalency under section   356(a)(2) of the Code, it is proper to look   solely at the change in A’s proportionate interest in X that resulted from A’s exchange of voting common stock for cash, or instead, whether consideration should   be  given to the total change in  A’s proportionate interest in X that resulted   from the exchange of voting common stock for both   cash and nonvoting preferred stock.  In  Rev.   Rul. 55-745,   1955-2 C.B.   223,   the   Internal Revenue Service  announced that for purposes of section   302(b)(3)   of  the Code, it would follow   the  decision in Zenz v. Quinlivan,   213   F.2d   914   (6th  Cir.1954),   that a complete   termination of shareholder interest may be   achieved when a  shareholder's   entire   stock   interest   in a corporation is disposed of  partly  through   redemption   and   partly through sale.

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  Since   the   exchange   of   voting   common   stock   for   cash   and   the  exchange   of voting common   stock for nonvoting   preferred   stock constitute an   integrated   transaction,   in   this   situation   involving   a_   single corporation,   it   1s   proper   to   apply   the   Zenz   rationale   so   that   both exchanges   are   taken   into consideration   in determining   whether   there   has  been   a meaningful   reduction   of A’s proportionate   interest   in X within   the meaning   of Davis.   Compare   Rev.   Rul.   75-83,   1975-1   C.B.   112,   which  holds   that   a   distribution   in   connection   with   a   transaction   qualifying under   section   368(a)(1)(A)   of the   Code   will   be   viewed   as   having   been  made   by the   acquired   or transferor   corporation   and   not   by the   acquiring or   transferee   corporation   for purposes   of making   a dividend   equivalency  determination   under   section   356(a)(2).  If the   exchange   of voting   common   stock   for preferred   stock   and   cash  in   this   situation   had   been   tested   under   section   302   of the   Code   as   a  redemption,   it would   not   have   qualified   under   section   302(b)(2)   or   (8)  because   there   was   neither   an   adequate   reduction   in   A’s   voting   stock  interest   nor   a   complete   termination   of   that   interest.   In   determining  whether   this   situation   is   analogous   to   a   redemption   meeting   the  requirements   of section   302(b)(1),   it is significant   that A’s interest   in the voting common   stock   of X was   reduced   from   28.57   percent   (129/420) to 23.08 percent   (99/390)   so   that   A   went   from   a   position   of holding   a   number   of shares   of voting   common   stock   that   afforded   A control   of X if A acted   in concert   with   only one   other   shareholder,   to a position   where   such   action  was   not   possible.   Moreover,   it is significant   that   A   no   longer   holds   the  largest   voting   stock   interest   in   X.   In   addition,   although   A   received  dividend   and   liquidation   rights from   the   15 shares   of nonvoting   preferred stock,   these   were   substantially   less   than   the   dividend   and   liquidation rights   of   the   30   shares   of   voting   common   stock   A   surrendered.  Accordingly,   the   requirements   of section   302(b)(1)   would   have   been   met  if the   transaction   had   been   tested   under   section   302,   and,   therefore,   the  cash   received   by A did not have   the effect of the distribution   of a dividend  within   the   meaning   of section   356(a)(2).  HOLDING When   A received   cash and   nonvoting preferred stock of X in   an integrated   transaction in exchange for voting common stock of X in a  recapitalization   described in  section   368(a)(1)(E) of  the Code, the   receipt  of cash did not have the effect  of  the  distribution of a dividend   within the  meaning of  section   356(a)(2).  529

530   T2 TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PAR  d.   STOCK   EXCHANGED   FOR   BONDS  Bazley   v.   Commissioner  Supreme   Court   of the   United   States,   1947.  Be   LUA   Way),   (Or Si Cis, 1ZIee),  = MR.   JUSTICE   FRANKFURTER   delivered   the opinion   of the   Court.  KK*  In the   Buzley   case,   No.   287,   the   Commissioner   of Internal   Revenue  assessed   an   income   tax deficiency   against   the taxpayer   for the year   1939.  Its validity   depends   on   the   legal   significance   of the   recapitalization   in that   year   of a   family   corporation   in   which   the   taxpayer   and   his   wife owned   all but   one   of the   Company’s   one   thousand   shares.   These   had   a  par   value   of $100.   Under   the   plan   of reorganization   the   taxpayer,   his wife,   and   the   holder   of the   additional   share   were   to   turn   in   their   old  shares   and   receive   in exchange   for each   old   share   five   new   shares   of no  par value,   but   of a stated   value   of $60,   and   new   debenture   bonds,   having  a   total   face   value   of $400,000,   payable   in ten   years   but   callable   at   any  time.   Accordingly,   the   taxpayer   received   3,990   shares   of the   new   stock for   the   798   shares   of his   old   holding   and   debentures   in   the   amount   of  $319,200.   At   the   time   of these   transactions   the   earned   surplus   of the  corporation   was   $855,783.82. The Commissioner charged to the taxpayer as income the full value  of the debentures. The   Tax Court   affirmed the Commissioner’s determination, against the taxpayer’s   contention that as a  “recapitalization” the transaction was a tax-free “reorganization” and  that   the debentures were “securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization,” “exchanged solely for stock or securities in such  corporation” “in pursuance of the plan of reorganization,” and as such no  gain is recognized for income tax purposes.   Internal Revenue Code,  §§  112(g)(1)(E) [the predecessor of § 368(a)(1)(E)] and 112(b)(3). The   Tax Court   found that   the recapitalization had “no legitimate   corporate business   purpose”   and   was therefore not a “reorganization”   within the  statute. The distribution of debentures, it concluded,   was a disguised  dividend,   taxable as earned   income   under §§ [61(a) and 301]. 4  T.C.   897.  The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,   sitting   en banc, affirmed,   two  judges dissenting.   155   F.2d 237.  Unless a transaction is a reorganization contemplated   by   § [368], any   exchange of  “stock or securities”   in connection   with   such   transaction, cannot   be “in pursuance of  the   plan of reorganization.”   While   § [868(a)] informs us that   “reorganization”   means, among other   things,   “a  recapitalization,” it does   not inform us what “recapitalization”   means. “Recapitalization” in connection   with   the income tax  has  been   part   of  the  revenue   laws   since   1921.   42   Stat.   227,   230, § 202(c)(2). Congress   has  never   defined it and   the   Treasury   Regulations   shed   only   limited   light.  Treas.   Reg.   103, §  19.112(g).   One   thing   is   certain.   Congress   did   not

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  incorporate some technical concept, whether that of accountants or of other specialists,   into § [868(a)], assuming that there is agreement  among specialists as   to the meaning of recapitalization. And so,  recapitalization as used in § [868(a)] must   draw its meaning from its  function in that section. It  is one of the forms of reorganization which obtains the  privileges afforded by § [368(a)]. Therefore, “recapitalization”  must be construed with reference to the presuppositions   and   purpose of § [868(a)]. It was not   the purpose of the reorganization provision to  exempt from payment of a tax what as a practical matter is realized gain.  Normally, a distribution by a corporation, whatever form it takes, is  a definite and rather unambiguous event. It furnishes the proper occasion  for the determination and taxation of  gain. But there are circumstances  where a formal distribution, directly or through   exchange of  securities, represents merely a new form of the previous participation in an enterprise, involving no change of substance in the   rights and relations of the interested parties   one to another or   to the corporate assets. As to  these, Congress has said that they are not to be deemed significant  occasions for determining taxable gain.  These   considerations   underlie   § [868(a)]   and   they   should   dominate the scope   to be given   to the various   sections,   all of which   converge   toward  a   common   purpose.   Application   of   the   language   of   such   a   revenue provision   is not   an   exercise   in framing   abstract   definitions.   In a series   of cases   this   Court   has withheld   the benefits   of the reorganization   provision in situations   which   might   have   satisfied   provisions   of the   section   treated as inert   language,   because   they were   not reorganizations   of the kind   with  which   § [368], in its purpose   and   particulars,   concerns   itself.   See Pinellas Ice   &   Cold   Storage   Co.   v.   Commissioner,   287   U.S.   462;   Gregory   v.  Helvering,   293   U.S.   465;   LeTulle   v.   Scofield,   308   U.S.   415.  Congress   has   not   attempted   a definition   of what   is recapitalization  and   we   shall follow   its example.   The   search   for relevant   meaning   is often  satisfied   not   by a futile   attempt   at abstract   definition   but   by pricking   a  line   through   concrete   applications.   Meaning   frequently   is built   up   by assured   recognition   of what   does   not   come   within   a concept   the   content  of which   is in controversy.   Since   a   recapitalization   within   the   scope   of  § [368]   is an   aspect   of reorganization,   nothing   can   be   a recapitalization for   this   purpose   unless   it   partakes   of   those   characteristics   of   a reorganization   which   underlie   the purpose   of Congress   in postponing   the  tax   liability. No   doubt   there was a recapitalization of  the Bazley   corporation in  the   sense   that   the symbols that represented its capital   were   changed, so that   the fiscal basis   of its operations   would   appear   very   differently   on its  books.   But the   form of a transaction as reflected by correct   corporate accounting   opens   questions as   to the   proper   application   of   a taxing  statute; it does   not   close   them.   Corporate   accounting   may   represent   that  correspondence   between   change   in   the   form   of capital   structure   and essential   identity   in fact  which is  of the essence   of  a  transaction   relieved  531

532  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  from   taxation   as   a   reorganization.   What   is controlling   is   that   a   new arrangement   intrinsically   partake   of   the   elements   of   reorganization  which   underlie   the   Congressional   exemption   and   not   merely   give   the  appearance   of it to accomplish   a distribution   of earnings.   In the case   of a  corporation   which   has   undistributed   earnings,   the   creation   of new  corporate   obligations   which   are   transferred   to stockholders   in relation   to  their   former   holdings,   so   as   to   produce,   for   all   practical   purposes,   the same   result   as a distribution   of cash   earnings   of equivalent   value,   cannot obtain   tax   immunity   because   cast   in   the   form   of   a   recapitalization-  reorganization.   The   governing   legal   rule   can   hardly   be   stated   more  narrowly.   To attempt   to do so would   only challenge   astuteness   in evading  it. And   so it is hard   to escape   the conclusion   that   whether   in a particular  case   a paper   recapitalization   is no   more   than   an   admissible   attempt   to  avoid   the   consequences   of an   outright   distribution   of earnings   turns   on details   of corporate   affairs,   judgment   on   which   must   be   left   to   the   Tax  Court.   See   Dobson   v.   Commissioner,   320   U.S.   489.  What have we   here? No doubt, if the Bazley corporation had issued  the debentures to Bazley   and his wife without   any recapitalization, it  would have made a taxable distribution. Instead,   these debentures were  issued as part of a family arrangement, the only   additional ingredient being an unrelated   modification of the   capital account. The   debentures were   found to be worth at least   their principal amount, and   they   were virtually cash because they   were callable at the will of the corporation  which in this case was the will of the taxpayer. One does not have to  pursue the motives behind actions, even in the more ascertainable   forms  of purpose, to find, as did the Tax Court, that   the whole arrangement took this form instead of an outright   distribution of cash or debentures,  because the latter would   undoubtedly have   been taxable income   whereas  what was   done could, with a show of reason, claim the   shelter of the  immunity of a recapitalization-reorganization.  The   Commissioner, the Tax Court   and the   Circuit Court of Appeals  agree   that nothing   was accomplished that would not have   been  accomplished   by an outright debenture dividend. And since we find   no misconception of law on the   part of the Tax   Court   and the   Circuit Court of Appeals, whatever   may have   been their choice of phrasing, their  application of the law to the facts   of   this case must stand. A  “reorganization” which is merely a vehicle, however elaborate or elegant,  for conveying   earnings   from accumulations to the stockholders is not a reorganization   under § [368]. This   disposes of  the case as  a matter of  law, since   the facts   as found   by the Tax   Court   bring them within it. And even if this transaction   were deemed a reorganization,   the  facts would   equally sustain   the imposition of  the  tax on  the debentures   under   § [354 and 356].  Commissioner v. Estate of Bedford,   325   U.S.   283.  In   the Adams case,   the   taxpayer   owned all but a few   of  the   5914 shares   of  stock   outstanding   out   of an   authorized   6000,   par   value   $100.  By a plan   of  reorganization,   the   authorized   capital   was   reduced   by half,

--- Page 603 ---

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  to $295,700, divided into 5914 shares of  no par value but having a stated  value of $50 per   share. The 5914 old shares were cancelled and the  corporation issued in exchange therefor 5914 shares of the new no-par  common stock and 6 per   cent 20   year debenture bonds in the principal  amount of $295,700. The   exchange was made on the basis of one new  share of stock and one $50 bond for each old share. The old capital  account   was debited in the sum of $591,400, a new no-par capital account  was credited with   $295,700, and the balance of $295,700 was credited to  a “Debenture Payable” account. The corporation at this time had accumulated earnings available for distribution in a sum not less than  $164,514.82, and this account   was left unchanged. At the time of the  exchange, the debentures   had a value not less than   $164,208.82.  The   Commissioner   determined   an   income   tax   deficiency   by treating the   debenture   bonds   as   a   distribution   of the   corporation’s   accumulated earnings.   The   Tax   Court   sustained   the   Commissioner’s   determination,   5  T.C.   351,   and   the   Circuit   Court   of Appeals   affirmed.   155   F.2d   246.   The  case   is governed   by our   treatment   of the   Bazley   case.   The   finding   by the  Tax   Court   that   the   reorganization   had   no   purpose   other   than   to achieve  the   distribution   of the   earnings,   is unaffected   by the bookkeeping   detail of leaving   the   surplus   account   unaffected.   * * *  Other   claims   raised   have   been   considered   but   their   rejection   does not   call for discussion.  Judgments   affirmed.  a MR.   JUSTICE   DOUGLAS   and   MR.   JUSTICE   BURTON   dissent   in both   cases  for   the   reasons   stated   in   the   joint   dissent   of   JUDGES   MARIS   and  GOODRICH   in the   court   below.   Bazley   v.   Commissioner,   3 Cir.,   155   F.2d  234,   244,  NOTE  The Bazley case involved a pro   rata exchange of common stock for  common stock and bonds.   For noncorporate shareholders, its significance diminishes whenever most   dividends   and   long-term capital gains are taxed  at the same preferential rate. Later cases have offered some   hope for qualifying a stock-for-stock-and-bonds   exchange   under Section   368(a)(1)(E)  if the exchange is not   pro rata.23 Several tax problems   remain for an exchanging   shareholder even if the transaction   constitutes a Type   E reorganization.   The rules   in Section   356(a)(2) and (d)  will   likely   result   in characterization of gain as   a dividend to the   extent of  the fair market value of   bonds   received   and the   corporation’s   earnings   and profits. Even if the shareholder does   not   realize a gain on   the exchange, the  regulations   suggest that a stock-for-stock-and-bonds   recapitalization may be  separately   analyzed  a  28 See   Seide v. Commissioner,   18 T.C.   502   (1952).  533

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  Type D reorganizations come in two basic forms. The “divisive D” involves a transfer by one corporation of some of its assets to a newly formed controlled subsidiary followed by a distribution of the stock of the  subsidiary in a corporate division   that qualifies under Section 355. This transaction has been examined in Chapter 10 along   with the other  aspects of corporate divisions. The second   form of Type D reorganization is “nondivisive.” It involves the transfer by one corporation of all or part  of its assets to a corporation controlled immediately after the transfer by  the transferor or its shareholders (or any combination) provided that   the  stock or securities of the controlled corporation are distributed in a transaction that qualifies under Section 354. For this purpose, “control” means ownership of at least 50 percent of the voting power or value of the transferee corporation.26   Section 354(b) requires the transferor corporation to transfer “substantially all” of its assets to the controlled  corporation and the stock, securities and other   properties that it receives  must be distributed, along   with its other   properties, to its shareholders pursuant to  a plan of reorganization. The   “nondivisive”   D   reorganization   has   always   been   an   odd character   in the   reorganization   alphabet.   As   illustrated   by the   Smothers  case,   which   follows,   it historically   was   invoked   by the Service   as   a weapon  to   attack   the   liquidation-reincorporation   transaction,   a   technique utilized   by taxpayers   in the   days   when   the   General   Utilities   doctrine   and  a   capital   gains   preference   worked   in   tandem   to   encourage   bailouts   of  corporate   earnings   at capital   gains   rates   without   any   corporate-level   tax on   distributions   in liquidation   or sales   of assets   pursuant   to a liquidation plan.   To   appreciate   why,   consider   a gambit   that   might   have   been   used   in  the   “good   old   days”   by Profit   Corp.,   a family   company   with   $800,000   of  accumulated   earnings   and   profits   and   a $2 million   net   worth,   consisting  of $1.5 million   of operating   assets   and   $500,000   of investment   securities. Assume   the   shareholders   wish   to   extract   the   securities   from   corporate solution   without   the   sting of a dividend   (then taxable   at higher   ordinary  income   rates) but to otherwise   continue   operating   their business   in a new corporation   with   fresh   tax   attributes   (e.g.,   no   earnings   and   profits)   and no   immediate   exposure   to the   accumulated   earnings   tax.  One classic plan to accomplish these   objectives was for the Profit Corp. shareholders to liquidate   the   corporation,   retain   the investment securities   and, after   an appropriate interval, reincorporate the operating assets under Section 351. Alternatively, Profit Corp. might transfer its operating assets to  a new   subsidiary in exchange for its stock and   then “liquidate,   distributing   the new stock and the investment securities to the shareholders. Whatever the   format,   the   basic   objective was to achieve what   were   then   the   tax   benefits   of a liquidation:   capital   gains at the shareholder level, nonrecognition at   the   corporate level,   a step-up in  basis   of  the   assets   in  the   reincorporated   enterprise,   and a fresh   start   for  the  earnings   and   profits  account.   The   Service   countered   by  arguing,   with  26   ~T.R.C.   § 368(a)(2)(H)@).  535

A liquidation-reincorporation   rarely   makes   sense   under   current   law if its form   is respected   for   tax   purposes.   Liquidating   sales   of assets   for cash   are   fully   taxable   and   distributions   of   appreciated   property   in complete   liquidation   will   trigger   corporate-level   gain   under Section   336 and   significantly   raise   the   tax   cost   of the   strategy.   Indeed,   if the   classic  liquidation-reincorporation   were   carried   out, it is now   taxpayers who   may  prefer   to   characterize   the   transactions   as   a   reorganization.   Although  they would   recognize   dividend   income   to the   extent   of the   boot   received,  the   good   news   is that   noncorporate   shareholders   likely   will   qualify   for the   preferential   qualified   dividend   rate,   and   the   transferor   corporation would   avoid   recognizing   gain on   its assets   under   Section   361   because   the  asset   bases   would   carry   over   to   the   transferee.   The   liquidation- reincorporation   strategy   may   retain   its vitality,   however,   in a few   limited situations,   such   as   when   the   corporation   has   losses   to shelter   the   gains resulting   from   the   distribution   of   appreciated   assets,   where   the  appreciation   in   the   corporation’s   assets   is   negligible,   or   where   the  corporation   has losses   that it is trying to accelerate   without   removing   the  loss assets   from   corporate   solution.  Smothers   v.   United   States  United States Court of Appeals, Fifth   Circuit, 1981.  642   F.2d 894.  = WISDOM, CIRCUIT   JUDGE:  J.E. and Doris Smothers filed this civil action to obtain a refund of  federal income taxes they   paid under protest. This   dispute arises from the dissolution of one of their wholly-owned business   corporations. The taxpayers   contend that the assets distributed to them   by that corporation should be   taxed at the   capital gain rate applicable to liquidating distributions. The Internal Revenue Service   (IRS) counters by  characterizing the dissolution as part of a reorganization,   thereby rendering the taxpayers’ receipt of the distributed assets taxable at ordinary   income rates. The district court viewed the transaction as a  reorganization   and ruled for the   IRS. We affirm.  q.  [Mr. and   Mrs. Smothers   owned all the outstanding stock   of Texas  Industrial Laundries of San   Antonio, Ine. (“TIL”), a company   engaged in  the business of renting   industrial uniforms   and   cleaning   equipment.  They also were   the sole shareholders of Industrial Uniform Services, Inc.  (IUS”),   which   they  formed to oppose a particular   competitor in  the San  Antonio   industrial   laundry   market.

IUS succeeded in weakening the business of competing firms, ultimately enabling TIL to purchase its main competitor. Four years later, taxpayers decided that IUS, having served its purpose,   should sell all   its non-liquid assets and dissolve. IUS adopted a plan of complete liquidation and sold its $23,000 of operating assets, which represented about 15 percent of the company’s net value, to TIL for cash. Under the law in effect   at that   time, IUS recognized no gain because the sale   of its assets was made pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation. IUS then  distributed its remaining $149,000 of net   assets to the taxpayers   and  dissolved under state law. The distributed assets consisted primarily of  cash and receivables.  On   their   personal   income   tax   returns,   taxpayers   treated   the   IUS transaction   in accordance   with   its form   (i.e.,   as   a complete   liquidation) and   reported   a   $148,000   long-term   capital   gain,   representing   the  difference   between   the $149,000   of assets   they received   in the liquidating  distribution   and   the   $1,000   basis   in their   IUS   stock.   On   audit,   the   IRS  characterized   the   sale   by IUS   of its operating   assets   to TIL   as   a Type   D  reorganization   and   treated   the   IUS   distribution   as   equivalent   to   a  dividend   under   Section   356(a)(2).   Dividends   then   were   taxed   as   ordinary  income   rather   than   at the lower   long-term   capital   gains   rates. After   paying   the   $71,840.84   deficiency   asserted   by   the   IRS,   the taxpayers   filed   a refund   suit   in federal   district   court.   The   court   upheld the   IRS’s   position,   finding   that   the   transaction   constituted   a   Type   D reorganization.   Ed.]  Il.  Subchapter   C   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   broadly   contemplates that   the   retained   earnings   of   a   continuing   business   carried   on   in  corporate   form   can   be placed   in the   hands   of its shareholders   only   after  they pay   a tax   on   those   earnings   at ordinary   income   rates.   That   general rule is, of course,   primarily   a consequence   of § 301,   which   taxes   dividend  distributions   as   ordinary   income.   The   Code   provides   for   capital   gain treatment   of corporate   distributions   in a few   limited   circumstances,   but  only   when   there   is either   a   significant   change   in relative   ownership   of  the   corporation,   as   in   certain   redemption   transactions,   or   when   the  shareholders   no   longer   conduct   the   business   themselves   in   corporate form,   as   in true   liquidation   transactions.   The   history   of Subchapter   Cin  large   part   has   been   the   story   of how   Congress,   the   courts,   and   the   IRS  have   been   called   upon   to   foil   attempts   by   taxpayers   to   abuse   these exceptional   provisions.   Ingenious   taxpayers   have   repeatedly   devised transactions   which   formally   come   within   these   provisions,   yet   which have   the   effect   of permitting   shareholders   to withdraw   profits   at capital  gain   rates   while   carrying   on   a   continuing   business   enterprise   in  corporate   form   without   substantial   change   in   ownership.   This   is   just  such   a case.

538   TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS   PART 2  The transaction in issue here is of the genus known as liquidation-  reincorporation, or reincorporation. The common denominator of such  transactions is their use of the liquidation provisions of the Code, which  permit liquidating   distributions to be received at capital gain rates, as a device through   which the dividend provisions may be circumvented.  Reincorporations   come in two basic patterns. In one, the corporation is dissolved and its assets are distributed to its shareholders in liquidation.  The shareholders then promptly reincorporate all the assets necessary to  the operation of the business,   while retaining accumulated cash or other  surplus assets. The transaction in this case is of the alternate form.   In it, the corporation transfers the   assets necessary to its business to another corporation owned by the same shareholders in exchange for securities  or, as here, for cash, and then liquidates. If the minimal technical  requirements of § [former § 337] are met, as they indisputably   were here,  the exchange at the corporate level   will not   result in the recognition of  gain by the transferor   corporation. [Current   law would require  recognition of gain on these facts. Ed.] If formal compliance with the  liquidation provisions were the only necessity, both   patterns would enable shareholders to withdraw profits from a continuing corporate business   enterprise at capital gain rates by paper-shuffling. Unchecked, these reincorporation techniques would eviscerate   the dividend provisions of the Code.  That result can   be avoided by recharacterizing   such   transactions, in  accordance with their true nature, as reorganizations. A reorganization is, in essence, a transaction between corporations that   results merely in “a continuance of the proprietary interests in the continuing enterprise  under modified   corporate form’—a phrase that precisely   describes   the  effect of a reincorporation. Lewis v. Commissioner, 1 Cir.1949,   176   F.2d  646,   648. Congress specifically recognized that   the throw-off of surplus  assets to shareholders in the course of a reorganization can be equivalent to   a dividend, and if so, should be   taxed as such. §§ 356(a)(1)-(2). The  reincorporation   transactions   described   above result   in a dividend  payment to the shareholders in every meaningful financial   sense. The assets retained by the shareholders therefore should be   taxed as  dividends as long as the transaction can   be fitted within the   technical requirements of one   of the six classes of reorganizations   recognized by  § 368(a)(1).  In  general, reincorporation   transactions are most easily assimilated into § 368(a)(1)(D) (““D reorganization”), as the IRS   attempted to do   in  this case. A transaction qualifies as   a D reorganization   only if  it meets  s1x statutory   requirements:  (1). There   must   be a transfer by a corporation (§  368(a)(1)(D));  (2)   of substantially all of its assets   (§  354(b)(1)(A));  (3)   to   a corporation   controlled   by   the   shareholders of   the transferor   corporation, or by   the   transferor   corporation itself  (§ 368(a)(1)(D));

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  (4) in exchange for stock or securities of the transferee  corporation (§ 354(a)(1)); (5)   followed   by   a   distribution   of the   stock   or   securities   of the  transferee   corporation   to   the   transferor’s   shareholders  (§ 354(b)(1)(B));  (6)   pursuant   to a plan   of reorganization   (§ 368(a)(1)(D)). On   this appeal,   the taxpayers   concede   that the transaction   in issue   meets every   technical   prerequisite   for characterization   as   a D   reorganization,  except   for   one.   They   argue   that   since   the   assets   sold   by   IUS   to   TIL amounted   to   only   15%   of   IUS’s   net   worth,   TIL   did   not   acquire “substantially   all   of   the   assets”   of   IUS   within   the   meaning   of  § 354(b)(1)(A).  We   hold   to the contrary.   The   words   “substantially   all assets”   are   not  self-defining.   What   proportion   of a corporation’s   assets   is “substantially all” in this context,   and   less   obviously,   what   “assets”   are   to be counted   in  making   this   determination,   cannot   be answered   without   reference   to the  structure   of Subchapter   C.   To   maintain   the   integrity   of the   dividend  provisions   of the   Code,   “substantially   all assets”   in this   context   must   be interpreted   as   an   inartistic   way   of expressing   the   concept   of “transfer   of  a   continuing   business”.   As   this   Court   implied   in   Reef   Corp.   v.  Commissioner,   5 Cir.1966,   368   F.2d   125,   132, cert.   denied,   1967,   386   U.S.  1018,   87   S.Ct.   1371,   18   L.Ed.2d   454,   it is in   a   sense   simply   a   limited  codification   of   the   general   nonstatutory   “continuity   of   business  enterprise”   requirement   applicable   to all reorganizations.  This   interpretation   finds   support   in the history   of § 368(a)(1)(D)   and § 354(b)(1)(A).   The   Internal   Revenue   Code   of   1939   had   no   provision equivalent   to   the   “substantially   all   assets”   requirement,   and   courts almost   uniformly   approved   attempts   by the   IRS   to treat   reincorporation transactions   as   reorganizations   within   the   predecessor   of § 368(a)(1)(D)  in   the   1939   Code.   The   “substantially   all   assets”   requirement   of § 354(b)(1)(A)   and   the   amendment   of § 368(a)(1)(D)   incorporating   that requirement   were   added   during   the   1954   recodification   as   part   of   a package   of amendments   aimed   at plugging   a different   loophole—the   bail- out   of   corporate   earnings   and   profits   at   capital   gains   rates   through divisive   reorganizations.   There   is no   indication   that   Congress   wished   to relax   the   application   of the   reorganization   provisions   to reincorporation  transactions.   Indeed,   the   committee   reports   indicate   the   contrary.   The  Senate   report   accompanying   the bill that contained   the “substantially   all  “assets”   requirement   of   § 354(b)(1)(A)   and   the   parallel   amendment   to  § 368(a)(1)(D)   stated   that   the   purpose   of those   changes   was   only   “to insure   that the tax consequences   of the distribution   of stocks   or securities to   shareholders   or   security   holders   in   connection   with   divisive reorganizations   will be governed   by the requirements   of section   355”.   The  report   expressly   noted   that   except   with   respect   to   divisive  reorganizations,   the   reorganization   provisions   “are   the   same   as   under  existing   law   and   are   stated in   substantially   the   same   form”.   Even   more  539

540  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  significantly, the   original House version of the 1954 Code   contained a  provision specifically dealing   with reincorporation transactions. That provision was dropped in conference because the conferees felt that such transactions “can appropriately be disposed of by judicial decision or by  regulation   within the framework of the other provisions of the bill’. As  the   court said in Pridemark, Inc. v. Commissioner, 4  Cir.1965, 345   F.2d  35, 40, this response shows that “the committee was aware of the problem and thought the present statutory scheme adequate to deal with it”. By  implication, this passage approved the IRS’s use of the predecessor of § 368(a)(1)(D) to meet the problem,   and shows that   the “substantially all  assets” amendment was not thought to restrict its use.  Courts   have   almost   unanimously   so   interpreted   the   “substantially all   assets”   language.   Moreover,   they   have   also   interpreted   the   other technical   conditions   for a D   reorganization   in ways   that   accomplish   the  congressional   intent   to reach   reincorporation   transactions.   For   example, the literal   language   of § 368(a)(1)(D)   and   §§ 354(a),   354(b)(1)(B)   requires  that   the   transferee   corporation   “exchange”   some   of   its   “stock   or  securities”   for   the   assets   of   the   transferor,   and   that   those   items   be  “distributed”   to   the   shareholders   of   the   transferor,   before   a   D reorganization   can   be   found.   Yet   both   of   those   requirements   have  uniformly   been   ignored   as   “meaningless   gestures”   in the   reincorporation  context,   in   which   the   same   shareholders   own   all   the   stock   of   both corporations.14   Smothers   does   not   even   challenge   the   applicability   of that  principle   here. Properly interpreted,   therefore,   the   assets looked to when   making  the “substantially all assets” determination should be all the assets, and  only the assets, necessary to operate the corporate business—whether or  not those assets would   appear on a corporate   balance sheet constructed according to generally   accepted   accounting principles. Two errors in  particular should be   avoided.   Inclusion of assets unnecessary to the operation of the business in the “substantially all assets” assessment would open the way for the shareholders of any   enterprise to turn  dividends into capital gain at will. For example, if we assume that  “substantially all” means greater than   90%,   then a corporation   need only cease declaring   dividends   and accumulate surplus liquid   assets   until their value   exceeds 10% of the total value of all corporate assets. The  shareholders could   then   transfer   the   assets   actively used in the business  to  a second   corporation owned   by  them   and liquidate   the  old corporation.  Such a liquidating   distribution would be a dividend in any meaningful sense, but  an interpretation of “substantially all assets”   that took   surplus assets   into account   would   permit the shareholders to treat it as capital  gain. Indeed,   such   an interpretation   would   perversely treat a merely  nominal distribution   of retained   earnings as   a dividend,   but   would permit   substantial   distributions to be made at capital   gain rates.

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  therefore have invariably   ignored all surplus assets and   have focused on the operating assets of the business—the tangible assets   actively used in the business—when making the “substantially all assets” assessment.15  Second,   exclusion   of assets   not shown   on a balance   sheet   constructed  according   to   generally   accepted   accounting   principles   from   the  “substantially   all assets”   assessment   would   offer   an   unjustified   windfall  to the owners   of service   businesses   conducted   in corporate   form.   The   most  important   assets   of   such   a   business   may   be   its   reputation   and   the  availability   of skilled   management   and   trained   employees,   none   of which show   up   on   a   standard   balance   sheet.   Other   courts   have   correctly recognized   that   in   appropriate   cases   those   intangible   assets   alone   may  constitute   substantially   all   of   the   corporate   assets.   Otherwise,   for  example,   a sole legal practitioner   who   owns   nothing   but   a desk   and   chair  could   incorporate   himself,   accumulate   earnings,   and   then   set   up   a new  corporation   and   liquidate   the   old   at capital   gain   rates—as   long   as   he   is careful   to buy   a new   desk   and   chair   for the   new   corporation,   rather   than  transferring   the   old.  When   these   principles   are   applied   to   this   case,   it   is   plain   that “substantially   all of the   assets”   of IUS   were   transferred   to TIL,   and   that  the   transaction   as   a   whole   constituted   a   reorganization.   TIL   and   IUS  were   both   managed   and   wholly   owned   by Smothers.   By the   nature   of its business,   IUS   was   wholly   a   service   enterprise;   indeed,   the   parties  stipulated   that   none   of the   tangible   assets   of IUS   were   necessary   to the operation   of its business.   The   extent   to which   those   tangible   assets   were transferred   to TIL   is therefore   entirely   irrelevant.   [US’s   most   important  assets—its   reputation,   sales   staff,   and   the   managerial   services   of  Smothers—were   all   transferred   to   TIL.   TIL   rehired   all three   of IUS’s  employees   immediately   after   IUS’s   liquidation,   and   continued   to   serve IUS’s   old customers.   The   same   business   enterprise   was   conducted   by the  same   people   under   the   same   ownership,   and   the   only   assets   removed from   corporate   solution   were   accumulated   liquid   assets   unnecessary   to  the   operation   of the   business.   To   treat   this   transaction   as   other   than   a  reorganization   would   deny   economic   reality;   to   permit   Smothers   to  extract   the   retained   earnings   of IUS   at capital   gain   rates   would   make   a mockery   of the   dividend   provisions   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code.  We do   not perceive   ordinary   income   treatment here to be particularly   harsh, or  a “tax  trap for the unwary’. It places   the Smothers’ only in  the   position   they   would   have   been in if they   had   extracted the +etained   earnings of IUS as the Code   contemplates   they should have—by  periodically   declaring   dividends.

542   ART   2 TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   iP  After   carefully   reading   the   majority’s   opinion,   I find   that   I must  respectfully   dissent.   Unlike   my   Brothers,   who   apparently   feel that   it is their   duty to “plug loopholes”,   I would   remain   content   in applying   the tax  law   as   it reads   leaving   the   United   States   Congress   to   deal   with   the  consequences   of the   tax   law   as   it has   been   drafted.   The   only issue before  this   Court   on   appeal   is whether   or not IUS   transferred   “substantially   all of   its   assets”   to   TIL.   Instead   of   dealing   with   this   straightforward question,   the   majority   has   made   a   case   of   evil   against   liquidation-  reincorporation   abuses   and,   in   an   attempt   to   remedy   every   such  perceived   abuse,   they have   relieved   the   Congress   of its burden   to change the   law   heretofore   requiring   that   “substantially   all”   of a   corporation’s  assets   be   transferred   to   now   read   that   “only   those   assets   necessary   to operate   the   corporate   business”   be   transferred   in   order   to   meet   the   “D reorganization”   requirements.   Essentially,   the   majority   has   changed   the  definition   of “substantially   all assets”   to mean   only   “necessary   operating  assets.”   I believe   if Congress   had   meant   “necessary   operating   assets”   it would   have   said   so   instead   of specifically   requiring   that   “substantially  all” of the   assets   be   transferred.   In   my   mind   “substantially   all” plainly  means   all of the   assets   except   for   an   insubstantial   amount.   Under   such  a definition,   the sale of 15%   of IUS’s   assets   to TIL   could   hardly   be defined  as “substantially   all” of IUS’s   assets. However, even after having redefined   “substantially all” to mean  “necessary   operating assets”, the IUS liquidation still falls short of the “D   reorganization” requirements because the stipulated facts   are that  absolutely   none of the   assets sold from IUS to TIL   were   necessary  operating assets for either corporation. Faced with an absence of a proper factual setting, the majority goes on to define necessary   operating assets  as including a corporation’s   intangible assets. Now while a sale   of intangible assets might be an appropriate   consideration in determining whether or not “substantially all” assets of a corporation have   been transferred,   such a consideration   simply   has no bearing in  this   case. All  of the   assets transferred to TIL   were   depreciated tangible objects   sold at book value after which   IUS   completely   ceased all business   operations. There   simply   was no other   transfer of TUS’s   intangible assets as   a  continuing business.  ave Je  ***   Although the Internal Revenue Service   has   never   questioned  the bona fides   of IUS’s   liquidation,   the majority   has   gone beyond the stipulated facts by   characterizing the   liquidation as   a tax avoidance scam.   I simply   cannot agree.   After   starting   from scratch, Mr. Smothers worked for over a dozen   years   refraining   from   drawing salary   in  order  that IUS could   pay its taxes, employees   and   other   operating   expenses  and in   order for IUS to become a successful   self-sustaining   business enterprise.   Mr.   Smothers   was   successful   but, now   that  he  no   longer could  devote   his   service   to IUS,   his   years   of  labor   are now   labeled   by   the  majority as a mere   “paper   shuffle.”   I do not   share   the majority’s   attitude.

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS 543  [The dissent then reviewed the “bottom-line facts” to support its view  that   the form of the transaction   should be respected. Ed.]  **R*K  It seems to me that in its attempt to “plug” a perceived “loophole,”  the majority is giving this Court’s imprimatur to a variation of the same so-called “mockery” of the tax laws sought to be prevented   by its opinion. For   these   reasons,   I respectfully   dissent.  NOTE All-Cash   Reorganizations.   The   IRS   has   been   rethinking   its approach   to nondivisive   Type   D   reorganizations.   It recently   has   focused   its attention   on the   “all-cash”   D   reorganization,   in   which   one   corporation   purchases substantially   all the   assets   of another   corporation   solely   for   cash   (or debt) and   without   issuing   any   stock.   All-cash   D   reorganizations   are   used   in   a variety   of situations   involving   commonly   controlled   corporations   that   wish  to   rearrange   and   simplify   their   corporate   structure   for   valid   business  reasons.   They   also occur   in the international   setting, or between   corporations filing   a   consolidated   return,   where   the   transaction   raises   additional   issues that   are   well   beyond   the   scope   of our   coverage   here.   From   the   taxpayer’s  perspective,   the   consequences   of   having   this   type   of   asset   acquisition  characterized   as   a   reorganization   rather   than   a   taxable   sale   can   be   either good   or bad   depending   on   the   context   and   planning   agenda. At first glance,   the concept   of a tax-free   reorganization   where   the target  corporation   receives   entirely   cash   consideration   in   exchange   for   assets   of  equal   value   is counter-intuitive.   But   the   IRS   has   taken   the   position   that  reorganization   treatment   is appropriate   in light of the history   of nondivisive  Type   D   reorganizations,   interpretations   by   the   courts,   and   the   need   for   a  neutral   rule   to provide   certainty   in planning.   This   result   is consistent   with the   underlying   policy   of   the   reorganization   scheme,   which   provides   for  nonrecognition   of gain or loss for transactions   that   represent   a mere   change  in the   form   of an   investment,   which   in this   case   are   the   assets   that   remain  in corporate   solution.   This   is particularly   appropriate   when   both   parties   to the   transaction   are   controlled   by the   same   shareholders.  The   IRS   position   evolved   from   a   much   discussed   private   ruling?$  involving   a transaction   where   a corporation   owned   equally   by two   unrelated  corporate   shareholders   (A and   B) sold   all its assets   for installment   notes   in an   amount   equal   to the fair market   value   of the   assets   to a new   corporation  (Newco)   owned   90 percent   by B and   10 percent   by a corporation   unrelated   to  A   and   B.   In   holding   that   Newco   took   a   cost   basis   in   the   acquired   assets (which   is   what   it   wanted   for   purposes   of   determining   Section   197  amortization   deductions   on   acquired   goodwill),   the   ruling   inferred   that   the  transaction   was   not   a D   reorganization   despite   the   presence   of substantial  (but not   identical)   overlapping   ownership   of the   two   corporations.   If Newco  had   issued   some   stock   as   consideration   for the   assets,   the   literal   statutory  requirements   for a D reorganization   would   have   been   satisfied,   however,   and  28   P.L.R.   20551018   (Dec.   23, 2005).

544 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Newco would have   been   required to take a lower transferred basis in the  acquired assets. By simply not issuing any stock, the taxpayer   avoided this undesired result, leading to the   possibility that taxpayers could elect the outcome they desired depending on whether or not any stock was issued.  The   ruling created   a commotion   in the mergers   and   acquisitions   tax bar  over   the   issue   of whether   the   issuance   of stock   is an   essential   prerequisite for   a   nondivisive   D   reorganization.   Some   commentators   argued   that   a transaction   could   qualify   as   a D   reorganization   even   though   Newco   issued  no   stock   or securities   because,   in similar   cases   of overlapping   ownership,   the Service   and   the   courts   had   held   that   issuance   of stock   was   unnecessary  under   what   is   known   as   the   “meaningless   gesture”   doctrine.?9   Others  contended   that   the   statutory   language   could   not   permit   such   a result   if no stock   or securities   were   issued. The   regulations   now   address   this   esoteric   issue.   They   provide   that   an  acquisition   can   qualify   as   a Type   D   reorganization   even   where   no   stock   of  the transferee   corporation   is issued   and   distributed   in the   transaction   when the   same   person   or   persons   own,   directly   and   indirectly,   all of the   stock   of the   transferor   and   transferee   corporations   in “identical   proportions.”3!   For  this   purpose,   an   individual   and   all   members   of   his   family   having   a  relationship   described   in Section   318(a)(1)   are   treated   as one   individual.32   In  addition,   the   distribution   requirement   under   Sections   368(a)(1)(D)   and  354(b)(1)(B)   is treated   as   satisfied   in the   absence   of any   issuance   of stock   or  securities   where   there   is a   de   minimis   variation   in shareholder   identity   or  proportionality   of ownership   in the transferor   and   transferee   corporations.33  In   these   all-cash   D   reorganizations,   the   transferee   is   treated   as   having  issued   a   nominal   share   of   stock   in   addition   to   the   actual   consideration  exchanged,   and   the transferor   corporation   is deemed   to have   distributed   that share   to its shareholders   and,   as   appropriate,   to have   further   transferred   it  to   the   extent   necessary   to   reflect   the   actual   ownership   of   the   two  corporations.34  The regulations are taxpayer-friendly insofar as they facilitate legitimate restructurings   involving asset transfers within a commonly controlled corporate group. Reorganization   treatment   ensures that a transfer of assets between commonly controlled corporations is not a taxable  event whether or not actual   stock is issued by the acquiring   corporation but,  as   a trade-off, the transferee   takes a transferred basis in the   assets it  29 See James   Armour, Inc. v.

Recall that,   after selling its assets, the transferor corporation will liquidate and distribute   the  cash consideration and the nominal share of stock it received in the transaction to its shareholders. Does it matter if the shareholders are  individuals or corporations? Problem 2, below, provides an opportunity to  consider these shareholder-level consequences, which are not directly addressed in the all-cash D reorganization regulations. Internal   Restructuring   Transactions.   The   IRS   has   issued   two   revenue  rulings   that   apply   Section   368(a)(1)(D)   to   provide   flexibility   and   certainty with   respect   to certain   commonly   used   internal   restructuring   transactions.  Revenue   Ruling   2015-935   involved   a transaction   known   as   a “drop   and sideways   merger.”   In   the   ruling,   P,   a domestic   corporation,   owned   all the stock   of   two   foreign   subsidiaries,   S-1   and   S-2.   S-1   directly   operated   a  business   while   S-2   was   a holding   company   that   owned   all the   stock   of three  foreign   operating   companies,   X,   Y   and   Z.   All   of   P’s   subsidiaries   were  incorporated   in the same   country.   As part of a prearranged   plan with   a valid  business   purpose,   P’s agenda   was   to combine   the   operating   companies   (S-1,  X, Y, and   Z) into   N, a new   foreign   subsidiary   of S-2.   To   achieve   that   result,   P  first transferred   all the   stock   of S-1   to S-2   in exchange   for additional   shares  of S-2 stock.   Immediately   after that transfer,   S-1, X, Y, and   Z then liquidated,  distributing   all the   N   stock   to   S-2.   The   IRS   ruled   that   the   first   step   of the  transaction   (P’s   transfer   of   S-1   to   S-2)   was   a   nontaxable   Section   351  exchange.   The   subsequent   transfers   and   liquidations   of 8-1, X, Y, and   Z were  treated   as   tax-free   reorganizations   under   Section   368(a)(1)(D).  The   restructuring   in   Revenue   Ruling   2015—10?¢   is known   as   a   “triple  drop   and   check.”   A   domestic   corporation,   P,   transferred   its   interest   in   a  limited   liability   company   that   had   elected   to be taxed   as   a corporation,   to a subsidiary,   S-1,   in   exchange   for   S-1   stock.   S-1   then   transferred   the   LLC  interest   to   another   subsidiary,   S-2,   for   S-2   stock,   and   S-2   next   transferred  the   LLC   interest   (this   was   the   third   “drop”)   to yet   another   subsidiary,   S-3,  for   S-3   stock.   No   later   than   one   day   after   S-2’s   transfer,   the   LLC   “checked the   box,”   electing   to be a disregarded   entity   for tax   purposes.   The   IRS   ruled  that   the transfers   by P and   S-1 were   nontaxable   Section   351   exchanges.   The  election   by   the   LLC   to   be   a   disregarded   entity   and   the   transfer   by   S-2,  however,   were   characterized   as   an   acquisitive   Type   D   reorganization  followed   by a tax-free   Section   332   liquidation   of a subsidiary. The   outcome of these   rulings is hardly   surprising   because no  assets were  removed from   corporate solution in  either transaction   and control   of P  was  unchanged.   The   reasoning reflects the   IRS’s   policy to respect   the form   ofa Section   351 exchange even it  if is followed by   subsequent transfers of  the “contributed   property as part   of a prearranged integrated plan. But the rulings also confirm that   the IRS will apply the   step transaction   doctrine to deny Section   351   nonrecognition or otherwise recast   the  separate   steps   of  an  integrated   transaction if “a different treatment is warranted to  reflect   the  35   2015-21   I.R.B.   972. 36   =. 2015-21   I.R.B.   973.  545

546  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  substance of the transaction as a whole.”37 Presumably, this means that the IRS does not want to be precluded from   applying the step transaction  doctrine when necessary to avoid what it believes to be an improper tax outcome, but without specific examples it is difficult   to know exactly when  this different approach   would be used.  PROBLEMS  1.   Brother   and   Sister   Corporation   are   owned   by the   same   shareholders   in the same   proportionate   amounts.   The   shareholders   have   a $200,000   basis   in  their   Brother   stock   and   Brother   Corporation   has   operating   assets   with   a value   of $500,000   and   basis   of $150,000   as   well   as   $200,000   of cash   and  $250,000   of earnings   and   profits.   Sister   Corporation,   which   has   $300,000   of  earnings   and   profits,   purchases   the   operating   assets   for   $500,000   cash   and  Brother   Corporation   immediately   liquidates. (a)   What   are   the   consequences   of   these   transactions   to   the shareholders   and   to both   corporations?  (b)   Will   the   arguments   of   the   taxpayers   and   the   Service  concerning   the   transactions   differ   from   those   advanced   in the Smothers   case?  (c) Is there any   simpler way for the taxpayers to achieve their objectives?  2. A, an individual, owns all the   stock of T, Inc. and B, A’s son, owns all  the stock of S, Inc. A has a $200,000 adjusted basis in his T stock. T sells all its assets,   in which it has a $100,000   aggregate   adjusted basis, to S for  $1,000,000 cash and then liquidates, distributing the cash to A. What are the tax consequences of the transaction to  all relevant   parties?  C. TYPE F: MERE   CHANGE IN IDENTITY, FORM, OR  PLACE OF ORGANIZATION  Code:   §§ 368(a)(1)(F);   381(b). Skim §§ 3831; 351;   354(a);   356(a);   358; 361;  10382.  A Type F reorganization is defined by the Code as “a mere   change in  identity, form, or place of organization of one corporation, however effected.” An   example   would be a merger of a closely   held New York corporation into a newly   formed   Delaware corporation   with the same shareholders in order to take advantage of Delaware corporate   law in anticipation of a public   offering of  the company’s stock.38 Nearly eighty years   ago a noted commentator stated   that   the Type   F  reorganization “is so  little relied upon   by  taxpayers that this part of the   statute   has   indeed perished   through lack  of use.”39 It has   survived calls for repeal, however,  37   sTd.  38   See,   e.g.,   Rev.

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  and   experienced a brief renaissance before resuming its historical role as a relatively dead letter in the tax-free reorganization alphabet.4° The resurgence of interest in the Type   F reorganization   was the result of attempts by taxpayers to carry back the post-acquisition losses of corporations which previously had been   operated as an affiliated  corporate   group to pre-acquisition years of an acquired corporation.   Since  Section 381(b) only permits such a carryback of net operating losses in  an F reorganization, the shareholders argued that the fusion of  affiliated  corporations qualified as an F reorganization. Although the language of  the applicable statute implied that an F reorganization   was limited to  structural changes in a single corporation, the Commissioner, in   his attempt to combat the liquidation-reincorporation bailout device, bolstered the argument that   the F reorganization also applied to the merger of two or more active corporations. In   the Davant case, the  Commissioner asserted and the Court   accepted the argument that an F  reorganization could   involve two operating corporations.4! The  Commissioner’s   argument, together   with a ruling in which the Service  acknowledged that a reorganization meeting the   definition of an F  reorganization   and   some other   type of reorganization would be   treated as an F reorganization for purposes of Section 381(b),42 opened the  floodgates. The only remaining question   was how far shareholders could push   combinations of operating   corporations into the F reorganization  category.43 In   the   1970s, the Service conceded that a combination of  active corporations under common control could   qualify as an F reorganization if there was a complete continuity of shareholder   and proprietary interests.44 But   Congress later slammed the   door   shut by  limiting F reorganization status to   a single operating   corporation  through the addition of the words “of one corporation” to Section  368(a)(1)(F). The   Type   F reorganization thus once again   was   relegated to its prior role as a minor provision governing reincorporations in another state and other merely formal   changes.   To finally put a capstone on   this  historical interlude on F reorganizations, the broad   disallowance in  Section   172 of carrybacks of  net operating losses   after the Tax Cuts   and  40 F reorganization issues occasionally resurface, usually in specialized situations.   See,  e.g., Rev.   Rul. 2003-19,   2003-1 C.B. 468   (involving   the conversion of a mutual insurance  company to a stock insurance   company). See also Prop.   Reg. § 1.368—2(m),   which specifies   the F reorganization qualification requirements   and   provides that continuity of business   enterprise  and   continuity of proprietary interest are   not required for a transaction to qualify as an F  ‘reorganization.  41 Davant v. Commissioner, 366   F.2d   874   (5th   Cir.1966), cert. denied   386   U.S.   1022,   87 S.Ct. 1370 (1987). Actually the Commissioner   made the argument at the trial court level, 43  T.C.   540 (1965), and it was   adopted   by the   appellate   court   in its opinion.  42   Rev.

548  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Jobs   Act now generally forecloses carrybacks even in qualifying F  reorganizations of a single corporation. To   limit   the   F   reorganization   to   its   narrow   purpose   and   prevent acquisitive   and   divisive   transactions   from   qualifying,   the   regulations  impose   six   requirements   for   a   transaction   to   be   a   “mere   change   in  identity,   form,   or   place   of organization”   within   the   meaning   of Section  368(a)(1)(F).   In   applying   these   tests,   the   regulations   use   the   term  “potential   F   reorganization’4>   and   refer   to   the   parties   involved   in   the  transaction   as   the   “transferor   corporation”   (“T’)   and   the   “resulting corporation   (“R”). The   six requirements   are:  (1)   Immediately   after   the   transaction,   all the   stock   of   R must  have   been   distributed   (or deemed   to have   been   distributed) in exchange   for stock   of T. This   requirement   is not   violated if a de minimis   amount   of stock   is issued   by R   to facilitate its organization.46 (2) The   same persons   generally must   own   T immediately before   the transaction and R   immediately after the transaction in identical proportions.47 (3) R generally may not hold any   property or have   any tax attributes immediately before   the transaction.48 (4) T  must completely liquidate for federal tax purposes.49 (5) Immediately after the transaction, R must be the only corporation   holding the property   previously held by T.50 (6) Immediately after the transaction, R  may not hold property acquired   from a corporation other than T.51  Based on these requirements, the regulations logically provide that  the continuity of interest and continuity of business   enterprise tests do  not have to be met for a transaction to qualify as an F reorganization.52  45 Reg. § 1.368—-2(m)(1). For simplicity,   the discussion in the text refers to a “potential F  reorganization” as the “transaction.”  46   Reg.   § 1.368—2(m)(1)(i).  47 Reg. § 1.368—2(m)(1)(ii). 48 Reg. § 1.368-2(m)(1)(iii).  49 Reg.   § 1.368-2(m)(1)(iv). The   complete liquidation requirement is not   violated, however, if R  stays alive as an   entity under state law and retains a de minimis amount of assets for the sole purpose of preserving its legal   existence. SO Res § 1.368—2(m)(1)(v). More specifically,   no corporation   other   than R   may hold  property   previously held by   T if such   other   corporation   would, as   a result, succeed to tax  attributes of T described in Section   381(c) (e.g., net operating loss carryovers).   This rule   reflects  the   policy  that   an F  reorganization   should not include   transactions   that   divide   up   the property of  the transferor   corporation   and   eliminates   the   possibility   that more   than one   corporation  would   have a claim to  T’s  tax   attributes. ; bt Reg: § 1.868—2(m)(1)(vi).   Reflecting   the   policy   that   an F   reorganization   should   only involve   one   corporation, R may not  hold   property   acquired   from   another   corporation if R  would  succeed to that other   corporation’s   tax   attributes   described   in  Section   381(c).  52 Reg.   §  1.368—2(m)(2).

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  The regulations also envision the step transaction doctrine applying   toa  series   of related transactions that together meet the requirements of an  F reorganization.53 And, as illustrated in Revenue Ruling 96-29, below,  an F reorganization may occur before, within, or after other transactions,  and the related events that precede or follow the F reorganization  generally will not cause it to fail under Section 368(a)(1)(F).54  Finally,   the regulations   sort out   statutory   jurisdiction   under   Section 368   in   overlap   situations.   They   generally   provide   that   if a   transaction meets   the requirements   of both   a potential   F reorganization   and   another  type   of asset   reorganization   (e.g.,   a Type   A, C or   D), it qualifies   only   as  an   F reorganization.

Q   is   a   manufacturing   corporation   all   of the   common  stock   of which   is owned   by   twelve   individuals.   One   class   of nonvoting preferred   stock,   representing   40   percent   of the   aggregate   value   of Q, is held   by   a   variety   of   corporate   and   noncorporate   shareholders.   Q   is  incorporated   in state   M.   Pursuant   to a plan to raise immediate   additional  capital   and   to enhance   its ability   to raise   capital   in the future   by issuing additional   stock,   Q   proposes   to   make   a public   offering   of newly   issued  stock   and   to cause   its stock   to become   publicly   traded.   Q entered   into   an  underwriting   agreement   providing   for the   public   offering   and   a change in its state   of incorporation.   The   change   in the state   of incorporation   was  undertaken,   in   part,   to   enable   the   corporation   to   avail   itself   of   the  advantages   that   the corporate   laws   of state   N   afford   to public   companies  and   their   officers   and   directors.   In the   absence   of the   public   offering,   Q  would   not   have   changed   its   state   of   incorporation.   Pursuant   to   the underwriting   agreement,   Q changed   its place of incorporation   by merging  -with   and   into   R, a newly   organized   corporation   incorporated   in state   N.  The   shares   of Q stock were   converted   into the right to receive   an identical  number   of shares   of R   stock.   Immediately   thereafter,   R   sold   additional  shares   of its   stock   to   the   public   and   redeemed   all   of the   outstanding  53   Reg.   § 1.368-2(m)(3)(). 54   Reg.   § 1.368—2(m)(3)(i).  55   Reg.   § 1.368-2(m)(3)G@v)(a).  549

Situation   2.   W,   a   state   M   corporation,   is   a   manufacturing corporation   all   of the   stock   of which   is   owned   by   two   individuals.   W  conducted   its business   through   several   wholly   owned   subsidiaries.   The management   of W   determined   that   it would   be in the   best   interest of Ww  to   acquire   the   business   of Z, an   unrelated   corporation,   and   combine   it  with   the   business   of Y, one   of its subsidiaries,   and   to change   the   state   of  incorporation   of W.   In order   to accomplish   these   objectives,   and   pursuant  to an   overall   plan,   W   entered   into   a plan   and   agreement   of merger   with Y   and   Z. In   accordance   with   the   agreement,   Z merged   with   and   into   Y  pursuant   to the law   of state   M, with   the former   Z shareholders   receiving  shares   of newly   issued   W   preferred   stock   in exchange   for their   shares   of Z stock.   Immediately   following   the   acquisition   of Z, W   changed   its place of   organization   by   merging   with   and   into   N,   a   newly   organized  corporation   incorporated   in   state   R.   Upon   W’s   change   of   place   of  organization,   the   holders   of   W common   and   preferred   stock   surrendered  their   W   stock   in exchange   for identical   N common   and   preferred   stock,  respectively.  LAW   AND   ANALYSIS  Section   368(a)(1)(F) provides that a reorganization includes a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization of one corporation,  however effected. This   provision was amended * * * in order to limit its application to one corporation. Certain limitations contained in § 381(b),  including those precluding the corporation   acquiring   property in a reorganization   from   carrying   back a net operating loss or a net   capital  loss for a taxable   year ending after the   date of transfer to a taxable   year of the   transferor,   do not apply to reorganizations   described in  § 368(a)(1)(F) “in recognition of the intended scope of such reorganizations as embracing only formal changes in a single operating  corporation.” H.R.Rep. No.   760, 97th   Cong.,   2d Sess. 540,   541   (1982).  Although a change in the   place of organization   usually must be effected through the merger of one corporation into another,   such a transaction  qualifies as  a reorganization   under § 368(a)(1)(F) because it involves   only  one operating   corporation. The 1982 amendment of § 368(a)(1)(F)   thus  overruled several   cases   in which a merger of two or more   operating corporations   could   be   treated as   a reorganization under   § 368(a)(1)(F).  See, e.g., Estate of Stauffer v. Commissioner, 403   F.2d   611   (9th  Cir.1968);  Associated   Machine, Inc. v. Commissioner, 403   F.2d   622   (9th   Cir.1968);  and   Davant v. Commissioner, 366   F.2d   874   (5th  Cir.1966).  A .transaction   does   not   qualify as   a reorganization   under  § 368(a)(1)(F)   unless   there is no change in  existing   shareholders or in  the  assets   of the corporation. However, a transaction will  not fail  to qualify as   a reorganization   under   § 368(a)(1)(F) if dissenters   owning   fewer   than

Rev. Rul. 66-284, 1966-2 C.B. 115.  The rules applicable to corporate reorganizations as well as other  provisions   recognize the unique characteristics of reorganizations  qualifying under § 368(a)(1)(F).   In contrast to other   types of reorganizations, which can involve two or more operating corporations, a reorganization of a corporation under § 368(a)(1)(F) is treated for most  purposes of the Code as if there had been no change in the corporation  and, thus, as if the reorganized corporation is the same entity as the  corporation that was in existence prior to the reorganization.   See  § 381(b); § 1.881(b)—1(a)(2); see also Rev. Rul. 87-110, 1987-2 C.B.   159;  Rev. Rul. 80-168, 1980-1 C.B. 178; Rev. Rul. 73-526, 1973-2 C.B.   404;  Rev. Rul. 64—250, 1964-2 C.B. 333.  In   Rev.   Rul.   69-516,   1969-2   C.B.   56,   the   Internal   Revenue   Service  treated   as   two   separate   transactions   a   reorganization   under § 368(a)(1)(F)   and   a   reorganization   under   § 368(a)(1)(C)   undertaken   as  part   of the   same   plan.   Specifically,   a   corporation   changed   its   place   of  organization   by   merging   into   a   corporation   formed   under   the   laws   of another   state   and   immediately   thereafter,   it transferred   substantially   all  of its assets   in exchange   for stock   of an   unrelated   corporation.   The   ruling  holds   that   the   change   in   place   of   organization   qualified   as   a reorganization   under   § 368(a)(1)(F).  Accordingly,   in   Situation   1, the   reincorporation   by   Q   in   state   N  qualifies   as   a   reorganization   under   § 368(a)(1)(F)   even   though   it was   a  step   in the   transaction   in which   Q was   issuing   common   stock   in a public  offering   and   redeeming   stock   having   a   value   of   40   percent   of   the aggregate   value   of its outstanding   stock   prior to the offering.  In   Situation   2, the   reincorporation   by   W   in   state   N   qualifies   as   a reorganization   under   § 368(a)(1)(F)   even   though   it was   a   step   in   the transaction   in which   W   acquired   the business   of Z.  HOLDING  On the facts   set forth in  this ruling,   in each of Situations 1 and 2,  the reincorporation   transaction qualifies as   a reorganization   under  § 368(a)(1)(F), notwithstanding the   other transactions effected pursuant  to the same plan.  kK*K*  ~PROBLEM  Golden State Corporation is incorporated in  California. It forms a new  corporation in Arizona,   Cactus   Corporation,   transferring all of its assets to  Cactus   Corporation in exchange for   all of  the   Cactus stock. Golden   State  Corporation is then   liquidated   with   the Golden   State   shareholders   receiving proportionate   amounts of  Cactus stock. What are  the tax consequences to  the Golden   State   shareholders?

Report   of Senate   Finance   Committee   on  Bankruptcy   Tax   Bill   of 1980*  S.Rep.   No.   96-1035,   96th   Cong.,   2d   Sess.   34-38,  reprinted   in 1980—2   Cum.   Bull.   620,   637.  Present   Law Definition   of reorganization  A transfer   of all or part   of a corporation’s   assets,   pursuant   to a court order   in   a   proceeding   under   chapter   X   of the   Bankruptcy   Act   (or in   a  receivership,   foreclosure,   or   similar   proceeding),   to   another   corporation  organized   or utilized   to effectuate   a court-approved   plan   may   qualify   for  tax-free   reorganization   treatment   under   special   rules   relating   to “insolvency reorganizations” (secs. 371-374 of the Internal Revenue Code).  These special   rules for insolvency   reorganizations   generally allow  less flexibility in structuring tax-free transactions than the   rules  applicable to corporate reorganizations as defined in section 368 of the  Code. Also,   the  special   rules for insolvency   reorganizations do not permit  carryover of  tax attributes to the transferee   corporation, and   otherwise  differ in important respects from the general reorganization rules.1 While  some   reorganizations under   chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act may be able to qualify for nonrecognition   treatment   under   Code section   368, other chapter X reorganizations may be able to qualify only under the   special rules of sections 371-374 and not under the general reorganization rules  of section 368.  Triangular   reorganizations In   the   case   of an insolvency   reorganization which can   qualify for  nonrecognition   treatment only under the   special   rules   of Code sections  371-374, the   stock or securities used to acquire the   assets of the  corporation in bankruptcy   must be  the acquiring   corporation’s own stock  or securities. This   limitation   generally   precludes   corporations in bankruptcy from engaging in so-called triangular   reorganizations, where  the acquired   corporation is acquired for stock of, the parent of   the  Some footnotes   omitted.

By contrast,   tax-free triangular reorganizations generally are permitted   under the general rules of Code section 368.  Transfer   to controlled   subsidiary In   the   case   of an   insolvency   reorganization   which   can   qualify   for  nonrecognition   treatment   only   under   the   special   rules   of Code   sections  371-374,   it is not   clear   under   present   law   whether   and   to what   extent  the   acquiring   corporation   may   transfer   assets   received   into   a controlled  subsidiary.   In   the   case   of other   corporate   reorganizations,   the   statute expressly   defines   the   situations   where   transfers   to   subsidiaries   are  permitted   (Code   sec.   368(a)(2)(C)).  Carryover   of tax attributes  In   the   case   of an   insolvency   reorganization   which   can   qualify   for nonrecognition   treatment   only   under   the   special   rules   of Code   sections  371-374,   court   cases   have   held   that   attributes   (such   as   net   operating losses)   of the   corporation   in   bankruptcy   do   not   carry   over   to   the   new  corporation.   In   the   case   of   other   corporate   reorganizations,   however, specific   statutory   rules   permit   carryover   of tax attributes   to the surviving  corporation   (Code   sec.   381).  Reasons   for change  The   committee   believes   that   the   provisions   of   existing   Federal income   tax   law   which   are   generally   applicable   to   tax-free   corporate reorganizations   should   also   apply   to   reorganizations   of corporations   in bankruptcy   or   similar   proceedings,   in   order   to   facilitate   the  rehabilitation   of financially   troubled   businesses.  Also,   the   committee   believes   that   a   creditor   who   exchanges  securities   in   a   corporate   reorganization   (including   an   insolvency  reorganization)   should   be   treated   as   receiving   interest   income   on   the  exchange   to the   extent   the creditor   receives   new   securities,   stock,   or any other   property   for   accrued   but   unpaid   interest   on   the   securities surrendered.  Explanation   of provisions Section   4 of  the bill generally conforms the   tax   rules governing  insolvency   reorganizations   with the   existing   rules applicable to other  corporate   reorganizations.   These provisions are the same as section   4 of  the House bill. Definition   of reorganization  In  general  The bill adds a new   category—“G”   reorganizations—to the   general  Code definition   of   tax-free   reorganizations (sec. 368(a)(1)). The   new category   includes   certain   transfers   of   assets pursuant to   a court-  approved   reorganization   plan  in  a bankruptcy case under   new title 11 of  the   U.S.   Code, or   in a receivership,   foreclosure, or similar   proceeding in  a  Federal   or  State   court.  553

554  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  KK*  In   order   to   facilitate   the   rehabilitation   of   corporate   debtors   in bankruptcy,   etc.,   these   provisions   are   designed   to   eliminate   many  requirements   which   have   effectively   precluded   financially   troubled  companies   from   utilizing the generally   applicable   tax-free   reorganization provisions   of   present   law.   To   achieve   this   purpose,   the   new   “G” reorganization   provision   does   not   require   compliance   with   State   merger laws   (as   in   category   “A”   reorganizations),   does   not   require   that   the financially   distressed   corporation   receive   solely   stock   of the   acquiring  corporation   in exchange   for its assets   (category   “C”), and   does   not require  that   the   former   shareholders   of the   financially   distressed   corporation control   the corporation   which   receives   the   assets   (category   “D”). The   “G”   reorganization   provision   added   by   the   bill   requires   the transfer   of assets   by a corporation   in a bankruptcy   or   similar   case,   and  the distribution   (in pursuance   of the court-approved   reorganization   plan)  of stock   or   securities   of the   acquiring   corporation   in a transaction   which qualifies   under   sections   354,   355,   or   356   of the   Code.   This   distribution requirement   is designed   to   assure   that   either   substantially   all   of the assets   of the   financially   troubled   corporation,   or   assets   which   consist   of  an   active   business   under   the   tests   of section   355,   are   transferred   to the  acquiring   corporation.  “Substantially   all” test The “substantially all” test in the “G” reorganization provision is to  be interpreted in  light   of the underlying intent in adding the new “G” category, namely, to facilitate the reorganization of companies in  bankruptcy or similar   cases for rehabilitative purposes.   Accordingly, it is  intended that facts and   circumstances relevant to this intent, such as the  insolvent   corporation’s need to pay off creditors or to sell assets or divisions to raise cash, are to be taken into account in determining whether a transaction qualifies as a  “GQ” reorganization.   For example, a transaction is not precluded   from satisfying   the “substantially all” test  for purposes of the new “G” category merely because, prior to  a transfer  to the acquiring   corporation, payments to creditors and asset   sales were made in order to leave   the debtor   with more manageable operating assets  to continue in business.5  Relation to other provisions  A transaction which qualifies as a “G” reorganization is not to be  treated as also qualifying as   a liquidation under section   332,   an  wb rik Because the   stated   intent for adding the new “G”  interpreting   the   “substantially all” tes comments in  the   text   as   to the appropr context   of a “G”   reorganization are interpretations   under   present   law of,  categories.  : category is not relevant to  st in the case   of other   reorganization   categories,   the 1ate interpretation of  the   “substantially all” test   in  the  not intended to apply to,   or   in any   way to   affect  the   “substantially all”   test   for other   reorganization

CHAPTER 11 NONACQUISITIVE, NONDIVISIVE REORGANIZATIONS  incorporation under section   351, or   a reorganization under another  category of section   368(a)(1) of the Code.§  A transaction in a bankruptcy or similar case which does not   satisfy the requirements of new category “G” is not thereby   precluded from  qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under one of the other   categories  of section 368(a)(1). For example, an acquisition of the stock of a company  in bankruptcy, or   a recapitalization of such a company, which transactions are not covered by the new “G”   category, can   qualify for  nonrecognition   treatment   under sections 368(a)(1)(B) or (E), respectively.  Continuity   of interest   rules  The   “continuity   of interest”   requirement   which   the   courts   and   the  Treasury   have   long   imposed   as   a   prerequisite   for   nonrecognition  treatment   for a corporate   reorganization   must   be met   in order   to satisfy  the   requirements   of   new   category   “G”.   Only   reorganizations—as  distinguished   from   liquidations   in bankruptcy   and   sales   of property   to either   new   or   old   interests   supplying   new   capital   and   discharging   the  obligations   of the   debtor   corporation—can   qualify   for tax-free   treatment.  It is   expected   that   the   courts   and   the   Treasury   will   apply   to   “G” reorganizations   continuity-of-interest   rules   which   take   into   account   the  modification   by P.L.   95-598   of the “absolute   priority”   rule.   As   a result   of  that   modification,   shareholders   or junior   creditors,   who   might   previously have   been   excluded,   may   now   retain   an   interest   in   the   reorganized corporation.  For   example,   if an   insolvent   corporation’s   assets   are   transferred   to a  second   corporation   in a bankruptcy   case,   the most   senior   class   of creditor  to   receive   stock,   together   with   all   equal   and   junior   classes   (including  shareholders   who   receive   any   consideration   for   their   stock),   should  generally   be   considered   the   proprietors   of the   insolvent   corporation   for “continuity”   purposes.   However,   if the shareholders   receive   consideration other   than   stock   of the   acquiring   corporation,   the   transaction   should   be  examined   to   determine   if   it   represents   a   purchase   rather   than   a reorganization.  Thus,   short-term creditors who receive   stock for their claims may be counted   toward satisfying   the   continuity of  interest rule, although   any  gain or loss realized by such creditors will be recognized for income tax  purposes. [For regulations   regarding the treatment of creditors’ claims as proprietary interests, see Reg. § 1.368-1(e)(6).   Ed.]  6 However, if  a transfer   qualifying as   a “G”   reorganization also meets the requirements of  section   351 or qualifies as   a reorganization   under section   368(a)(1)(D) of  the   Code,   the  “excess liability”   rule   of  section   357(c)   applies if any   former   shareholder of  the   transferor   corporation receives   consideration for  his stock,  but does   not  apply if  no former   shareholder of the  transferor  corporation   receives   any   consideration for  his   stock (i.e., if the corporation is insolvent).   This  rule   parallels   present   law,   under   which   insolvency   reorganizations   under   sections   371 or 374 are   excluded   from   the   application   of section   357(c).  555

556  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Triangular   reorganizations  The   bill   permits   a corporation   to   acquire   a   debtor   corporation   in a “G’   reorganization   in exchange   for   stock   of the   parent   of the   acquiring corporation   rather   than   for its own   stock. In addition,   the bill permits   an   acquisition   in the   form   of a “reverse  merger”   of an   insolvent   corporation   (i.e., where   no   former   shareholder   of  the   surviving   corporation   receives   any   consideration   for   his   stock)   in   a  bankruptcy   or   similar   case   if the   former   creditors   of   the   surviving  corporation   exchange   their   claims   for   voting   stock   of   the   controlling  corporation   which   has   a value   equal   to at least   80 percent   of the   value   of the   debt   of the   surviving   corporation.  Transfer   to controlled   subsidiary  The   bill permits   a corporation   which   acquires   substantially   all the assets   of a   debtor   corporation   in   a   “G”   reorganization   to   transfer   the  acquired   assets   to a controlled   subsidiary   without   endangering   the   tax-  free   status   of   the   reorganization.   This   provision   places   “G” reorganizations   on   a   similar   footing   with   other   categories   of  reorganizations. Carryover   of tax attributes Under the bill, the statutory rule generally governing carryover of tax attributes in corporate reorganizations   (Code sec. 381) also applies in  the case   of a “G” reorganization. This eliminates the   so-called   “clean slate” doctrine.  “Principal   amount”   rule;   “boot” test Under the bill, “G” reorganizations are subject to the  rules governing  the  tax treatment of exchanging shareholders   and security   holders which  apply to other corporate   reorganizations.  Accordingly, an exchanging shareholder or security   holder of the debtor company   who receives   securities with a principal amount exceeding the principal amount of securities surrendered is taxable on the   excess, and an exchanging   shareholder or security   holder who surrenders no securities is taxed on   the principal amount of any  securities   received.   Also, any “boot” received is subject to the general  dividend-equivalence test of Code section   356.  Treatment of  accrued interest  Under the bill, a creditor exchanging securities   in any   corporate reorganization   described in   section 368 of  the Code (including a “G”  reorganization) is treated as receiving   interest income on   the exchange  to the   extent   the   security   holder   receives new securities, stock,   or any other   property   attributable to accrued   but   unpaid interest Gitluding  accrued original   issue   discount)   on   the   securities Surrendered.   This provision,   which   reverses   the   so-called Carman rule,   applies whether or  not the  exchanging   security holder   realizes   gain  on   the  exchange   overall  Under this  provision,   a  security   holder   which   had   previously   accrued Ns

Example  The reorganization provisions of the bill are illustrated in part by the following example.  Assume   that   Corporation   A is in a bankruptcy   case   commenced   after December   31,   1980.   Immediately   prior   to   a   transfer   under   a   plan   of  reorganization,   A’s   assets   have   an   adjusted   basis   of $75,000   and a fair  market   value   of   $100,000.   A   has   a   net   operating   loss   carryover   of $200,000.   A   has   outstanding   bonds   of $100,000   (on   which   there   is no  accrued   but   unpaid   interest)   and   trade   debts   of $100,000.  Under   the   plan   of reorganization,   A   is to   transfer   all its assets   to Corporation   B   in   exchange   for   $100,000   of B   stock.   Corporation   A   will distribute   the   stock,   in exchange   for their   claims   against   A, one-half   to  the   security   holders   and   one-half   to the   trade   creditors.   A’s shareholders  will   receive   nothing.  The   transaction   qualifies   as   a   reorganization   under   new   section  368(a)(1)(G)   of   the   Code,   since   all   the   creditors   are   here   treated   as proprietors   for continuity   of interest   purposes.   Thus,   A recognizes   no   gain  or   loss   on   the   transfer   of its assets   to B   (Code   sec.   361).   B’s basis   in the  assets   is   $75,000   (sec.   362),   and   B   succeeds   to   A’s   net   operating   loss  carryover   (sec.   381). Under   the   bill,   the   pro-rata   distribution   of B   stock   to A’s   creditors  does   not   result   in income   from   discharge   of indebtedness   [But   see   I.R.C. § 108(e)(8),   which   now   makes   stock-for-debt   exchanges   subject to Section  108.   Ed.]  Assume   the   same   facts   as   above   except   that   B also transfers   $10,000  in   cash,   which   is   distributed   by   A   to   its   creditors.   Although   A   would otherwise   recognize   gain on   the   receipt   of boot   in an   exchange   involving appreciated   property,   the   distribution   by A of the   $10,000   cash   to those  creditors   having   a   proprietary   interest   in   the   corporation’s   assets   for continuity   of interest   purposes   prevents   A   from   recognizing   any   gain (Code   sec.   361(b)(1)(A)).18  PROBLEM  Debtor   Corporation is in bankruptcy. Debtor’s assets have an adjusted  basis   of $75,000   and a value of $100,000,   and the corporation   has a net  ‘operating loss   of $200,000,   bonds   outstanding (with no accrued   unpaid interest)   of $100,000   and trade   debts   of $100,000.   Debtor transfers all of its  assets to Relief Corporation in return for $100,000 of  Relief stock which will  pass   half to the   security   holders   and half to trade   creditors.

CHAPTER   12  CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE  TAX ATTRIBUTES  A.   INTRODUCTION  Code:   § 381(a).   Skim   § 381(c).  The   Internal   Revenue   Code   contains   a   comprehensive   statutory scheme   governing   the   carryover   of various   corporate   “tax   attributes” (such   as   earnings   and   profits,   net   operating   losses,   and   capital   loss carryforwards)   on   corporate   acquisitions   and   other   major   transactions  involving   a change   of ownership   of a corporation.   As   always,   some   brief historical   background   helps   to put the current   law   into   perspective. The   earliest   versions   of the   Code   contained   few   rules   regulating   the  carryover   of   corporate   tax   attributes.   The   Supreme   Court   merely followed   the lead of lower   courts!   in holding   that   a corporation’s   earnings  and   profits   could   not   be   eliminated   by   means   of a   reorganization   but  instead   the   acquiring   corporation   inherited   the   target’s   earnings   and profits   along   with   its   assets.2   Because   any   other   approach   would   have  allowed   a   profitable   corporation   to   use   a   reorganization   to   sweep   its earnings   and   profits   account   clean   and   diminish   future   dividends,   the Court’s   decision   was   no   more   surprising   than   the   reaction   of the   tax bar  to   the   proposition   that   corporate   attributes   could   survive   a reorganization.   They   assumed,   or   at   least   hoped,   that   an   acquiring  corporation   could   inherit   negative   as   well   as   positive   tax   attributes   in a tax-free   reorganization   or   liquidation.   If that   assumption   proved   true, profitable   corporations   could   acquire   the   assets   of their   unprofitable brethren   solely to succeed   to the target’s   earnings   and   profits   deficit   and net operating   losses   (NOLs).   The   acquiring   corporation   thus   could   assure itself that   future   distributions   would   be sheltered   by the   newly   acquired earnings   and   profits   deficit   and   that   future   income   would   be   effectively exempt   from   tax because   of the   newly   acquired   NOLs.  The Supreme Court   responded   by holding that earnings   and profits  deficits did   not survive a reorganization?   and that NOLs could   be   used  only by the corporate entity   that incurred   them.‘   But tax advisors   were  not to be  outdone.   Shortly after these   decisions,   several   reorganizations which followed a similar   pattern   appeared on   the   scene. Loss   Corp., a 1 See, e.g., Commissioner v. Sansome, 60   F.2d   931   (2d Cir.1932), cert. denied,   287 U.S.  667,   53  S.Ct. 291   (1932).  2 (Commissioner v. Munter,   331   U.S.   210,   67   S.Ct. 1175   (1947).  3 Commissioner v. Phipps,   336   U.S.   410,   69  S.Ct. 616   (1949).  4 New Colonial   Ice  Co. v. Helvering,   292   U.S.   435,   54  S.Ct.   788   (1934).   But see Helvering v. Metropolitan   Edison,   306   U.S.   522,   59   S.Ct.   634   (1939),   where   the   Court   held   that   these  attributes   did follow   the target’s   assets  in certain   mergers.  559

TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  corporation   with   NOLs   but   no   current   income   to   absorb   them,   would acquire   the   assets   of Profit   Corp.,   a   successful   company,   in   a   tax-free reorganization.   In   the   process,   the   Profit   Corp.   shareholders   would  receive   more   than   enough   Loss   Corp.   stock   to control   the   continuing   and  expanded   Loss   Corp.   Since   Loss   Corp.   technically   was   the   surviving  entity,   it retained   its   NOLs,   which   then   were   used   to   offset   the   gains  generated   by   the   new   business.   Once   again,   the   Supreme   Court   was  forced   to   respond   to   a   device   involving   trafficking   in   tax   attributes.   In Libson   Shops,   Inc.   v.   Koehler,’   the   Court   decided   that   even   if a   loss corporation   survives   a   reorganization,   NOLs   incurred   prior   to   the  transaction   only could   be used   to offset postacquisition   gains   if they were  generated   by substantially   the   same   business   as   well   as   the   same   entity which   had   incurred   the losses.  With   the   arrival   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code   of 1954,   the   case   law  regulating   the   carryover   of   tax   attributes   was   replaced   by   a  comprehensive   statutory   scheme.®   The   principal   provisions   are:   (1) Section   381,   which   generally   provides   that   a   target   corporation’s   tax attributes   follow   its assets   in tax-free   reorganizations   (other   than   B and E reorganizations)   and   tax-free   liquidations   of a subsidiary;   (2) Sections 382   and   383,   which   restrict   the   carryforward   of net   operating   losses   and certain   other   losses   and   credits   following   a   substantial   change   of  ownership;   (3) Section   384,   which   limits   the   use   of loss   carryforwards   to  offset certain   gains following   a corporate   acquisition;   and   (4) Section   269, which   allows   the   Secretary   to   disallow   deductions,   credits   or   other  allowances   in certain   situations   where   one   corporation’s   stock   or   assets  were   acquired   for   the   principal   purpose   of   obtaining   the   specific  deductions,   credits   or allowances   in question.   This   chapter   first considers the general   carryover   rules   and   limitations   in Section   381   and   then   turns to the   more   specialized   limitations   on   loss carryforwards.  B. SECTION 381 CARRYOVER RULES  Code: § 381(a), (b). Skim   § 381(c). General   Carryover Rules. Section   381(a) provides that in a tax-free  liquidation of a subsidiary or  a reorganization (other than a Type   B or E reorganization), the acquiring   corporation shall “succeed to and take into account” certain   specified   tax attributes of the  target,’ including   earnings  and profits, NOLs, accounting   and   depreciation   methods,   and capital  loss, investment credit and   charitable   contribution   carryovers.8   In a Type  5 353 U.S.   382,   77 S.Ct. 990 (1957).  6 Some   commentators and courts have su L   1 ggested   that   the Libson   Shops   d survived the 1954   Code,   but Congress   intended specificall Meee  7 LR.C. § 381(¢)(1)-(26).

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES 561  B stock-for-stock   acquisition and a Type E recapitalization, the acquired  or recapitalized corporation remains intact after the transaction and thus  no carryover mechanism is necessary. The regulations adopt a strict but simple approach for determining the “acquiring” corporation   with respect  to all tax attributes governed   by Section 381. Only a single “acquiring”  corporation may succeed to the target’s   tax attributes.9   In a Section   332 liquidation of a subsidiary, the parent is the acquiring corporation.1° In a Type A, C, D, F or G reorganization, the corporation that directly  acquires the transferred assets is the acquiring   corporation even if it  ultimately retains none of those assets because all or part of them are  dropped down to a controlled subsidiary.  Earnings   and   Profits   Deficits.   Left   unchecked,   Section   381   would  subject   the   revenue   to some   of the same   abuses   already   discussed.   As we  have   seen,   one   promising   tax   avoidance   strategy   is   presented   where Profit   Corp.   acquires   Loss   Corp.’s   assets   in a reorganization   and   inherits its earnings   and   profits   deficit   and   NOL   carryovers.   To   some   extent,   this  abuse   is limited   by   Section   381   itself.   Section   381(c)(2)   restricts   Profit  Corp.’s   ability to rid itself of its own   current   or accumulated   earnings   and  profits   through   a   simple   acquisition   of Loss   Corp.   by providing   that   an earnings   and   profits   deficit   inherited   from   Loss   Corp.   may   not be applied  against   any   earnings   and   profits   of Profit   Corp.   that   existed   prior to the  acquisition.   Loss   Corp.’s   deficit   therefore   only   can   be   used   to   offset  postacquisition   accumulated   earnings   and   profits.   If a   distribution   is  made   in a postacquisition   year   in which   there   are   current   earnings   and  profits,   any   offsetting   accumulated   deficit   acquired   from   Loss   Corp.   is  irrelevant   in   any   event,   since   the   distribution   will   be   deemed   to   come from   the   current   earnings   and   profits   of the   taxable   year   and   then   from Profit   Corp.’s   own   preacquisition   accumulated   earnings   and   profits.!?  Net   Operating   Losses.   Even   though   Profit   Corp. receives   little benefit from   Loss   Corp.’s   earnings   and   profits deficit, Loss’s   NOL   carryovers   still might   be   used   to   eliminate   Profit’s   own   tax   liability.   Section   381(c)(1)  provides   complex   rules   governing   the   carryover   of NOLs,   but   it does   not  prevent   them   from   being   misused   by Profit   Corp.   Instead,   Section   382, which   is discussed   later   in this   chapter,   is the   designated   policing   agent in this   situation. Rather   than Profit Corp.   acquiring the   assets and tax   attributes of Loss Corp., Loss might acquire Profit’s assets   in a Type A or C reorganization, maintaining Loss’s earnings   and profits deficit and NOLs _without   assistance   from   Section   381, and   then   might   hope to use   those  negative tax  attributes to  offset Profit’s past and future   income.   The basic  9 Reg. § 1.381(a)—1(b)(2)().   See also Reg. § 1.312-11(a) for the same rule  for earnings   and profits.  10   Reg.   § 1.381(a)—1(b)(2)().  11 Id. See   Reg. § 1.381(a)—1(b)(2)(ii) Example 2. 12 T.R.C. § 381(c)(2)(B).   See   Chapter 4,  supra.   Thus,   an   acquired   earnings   and   profits  deficit   will  do  no   more   than   prevent   undistributed   current   earnings   and   profits   from   becoming  accumulated   earnings   and   profits in a subsequent   year.

562  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  NOL rules in Section 172 operate to limit certain abuses in this situation. The   Tax Cuts and Jobs   Act modified the NOL deduction by (1) limiting it to 80 percent of the taxpayer’s   taxable income for the taxable year, and (2) providing that NOL carryforwards extend indefinitely into the future without expiration.1® These rules are effective for losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Act also generally disallows NOL carrybacks for tax years ending after 2017.14 Thus, after 2017 Loss   generally would be precluded   from   carrying back its NOLs to any prior   years.!5 In  addition, if Profit’s shareholders receive sufficient  Loss   Corp. stock to control   the combined   company, the transaction in  substance is identical to the acquisition of Loss   Corp. by Profit. The  future   benefits of this transaction also are limited by both Sections   381(b)  and 382.  PROBLEMS  1. Acquiring   Corporation (“P”) acquires the   assets of Target   Corporation (“T”) in a valid Type   C reorganization. Both corporations are calendar year  taxpayers   and the transactions are completed on December 31, Year 1.  (a)   If P has accumulated earnings   and profits   of $30,000   and T has an earnings   and profits deficit of $50,000, what result to the P shareholders in Year 1 if during that year P has $20,000 of current earnings   and profits, T breaks even, and P  distributes $20,000 cash?  (b) What result in (a), above, if P breaks even in Year 1 and makes  no distributions during that year   but   distributes $20,000 in  Year 2, a year when P also breaks   even?  (c) What result   in (b), above, if in Year 1, P has a $10,000 current earnings   and profits deficit? (d) What result   in (b), above, if in addition in Year 3 P has a $10,000 current earnings   and profits deficit and makes a  $20,000 cash   distribution?  (e) What result   in (d), above, if in addition in Year 4, P has  $20,000 of current earnings   and profits and makes a $20,000  cash   distribution?  (f) What result   in (e), above, if P makes no distribution in Year 4,  but   distributes $40,000 in Year 5, a year in which   P   breaks  even. ‘  2. T  Corporation   merges into P  Corporation   two-thirds of the way   through  P’s  year. What are the results   in  the  following   situations:  13 LR.C.  § 172(a), (b)(1)(A)(ii).  14 There are exceptions  I.R.C. § 172(b)(1)(B) & (C).  15 Section   381(b)(8)   also contains a  for farming losses and losses incurred by  insurance   companies.

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  (a) Phas $30,000 of deficit earnings   and profits for the entire year  of the acquisition and T has $30,000 of accumulated earnings  and profits at the   date of the   acquisition. The combined  corporation makes a distribution of $20,000 in the succeeding  year when it breaks even.  (bo)   Same   as   (a), above,   except   that   P   Corporation   has   $30,000   of  current   earnings   and   profits   for the   year   and   T has   a $30,000  earnings   and   profits   deficit   at the   time   of the   acquisition.   The combined   corporation   again   makes a distribution   of $20,000   in the   succeeding   year,   when   it breaks   even.  (c)   Same   as   (b),   above,   except   that   the   combined   corporation  makes   a distribution   of $30,000   on   the   last   day   of the   year   of acquisition. 3.   T   Corporation   merges   into   P   Corporation   in   a   tax-free   Type   A  reorganization   in which   T shareholders   receive   51 percent   of the outstanding P stock.   Both   corporations   are   calendar   year,   accrual   method   taxpayers   and  the   merger   occurs   on   December   31, Year   3. Both   corporations   have   been   in  existence   for   two   years,   with   T   sustaining   a   $20,000   loss   in each   of those years   and   P earning   a profit of $30,000   in each   year.  (a)   May   the combined   corporation   carry   back   T’s losses   and   apply them   against   P’s profits   for Year   1 and Year   2?  (b)   Assuming   that   the   loss   and   income   patterns   continue,  determine   the   combined   corporation’s   net   income   for Year   4 through   Year   8. (c)   What   results   in   (b), above,   if T were   a profitable   corporation  with   net   income   of $20,000   in each   of the   prior   and   current years   but   P sustained   a $100,000   loss in Year   4 followed   by a  return   to the regular   gain pattern   in Year   5?  C.   LIMITATIONS   ON   NET   OPERATING   LOSS  CARRYFORWARDS:   SECTION   382  1.   INTRODUCTION  Code:   Skim   § 382(a),   (b)(1),   (g)(1),   @)(). Before examining the   Section   382   limitations on carryovers of  corporate NOLs, it  is helpful to review the concept of a net operating loss.  In general, a net operating loss, often   identified by its “NOL”   monogram,  is the   excess   of business   deductions   allowed   by the Code over   the  taxpayer’s   gross income in a single  taxable   period.16   Generally, in taxable  years   before   2018, a net operating loss ordinarily   could   be carried   back to the   two   taxable   years   preceding the   loss year   and   carried   forward to  the   20   following   years.17 The   Tax   Cuts   and   Jobs   Act   modified   the NOL  for taxable   years   beginning after 2017   by (1) limiting it  to 80  percent   of  16 See   generally   I.R.C. § 172. 17 LR.C.   §  172(b)(1)(A)   (pre-2018).  563

564   PART   2 TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS  the taxable income for the taxable year, (2) providing that carryforwards of NOLs extend indefinitely into the future without expiration, and (3) generally ending   carrybacks of NOLs.18   The   purpose of the carryover scheme is to serve as an averaging device   that ameliorates the harsh  consequences that would result for a business taxpayer with a  fluctuating economic track record. As the Supreme Court has   described NOL carryovers, “[t]hey were designed to permit a taxpayer to set  off its lean years against its lush years, and to strike something like an average taxable income computed over a period longer than one year.”!9 All  of this works   smoothly in the corporate setting if the owners of the entity remain  unchanged during the future   years in which the loss may be used. Section  382 addresses the problems that arise if the ownership of a loss  corporation changes at a time that  the company has unused net operating  losses.  A profitable   company   seeking   tax savings   may   be tempted   to acquire a corporation   with   NOL   carryovers   to use   those   deductions   to shelter   its  taxable   income.   To   illustrate,   assume   that   Mr.   Loser   forms   Loss   Co.   to  engage   in   the   manufacture   and   sale   of passing   fads.   The   company   is initially   capitalized   with   $1,000,000,   all   represented   by   Mr.   Loser’s  equity   investment.   Despite   Loser’s   high   hopes,   Loss   Co.   incurs   $999,999  in deductible   expenses   in the   first   two   years   of its   operation   and   never  earns   a cent. At the end of two   years,   the company   has nothing   left except  $1 in its checking   account   and   a $999,999   NOL   deduction   that   is useless  because   Loss   Co.   has   no   income   to offset.   At   that   point,   the   company   is  worth   $1 plus the value,   if any,   of its deductions.   If Loss   Co. is liquidated,  the   sad   story   ends.   If   Loser   infuses   new   property   or   cash   into   the  corporation   to keep   the business   afloat,   then   Loss   Co.   may   deduct   its loss  carryforwards   against   any   future   income   as   long   as   Loser   continues   to  own   a controlling   interest   in the   company. But what if Profit   Co., shopping   around for tax deductions,   learns of  Loss Co.’s difficulties? If Profit wishes to acquire Loss, it has many  options. It could: (1) acquire all of Loss Co.’s assets (i.e., $1) in exchange  for Profit   Co. stock in an   acquisitive Type A or C tax-free reorganization, as a result  of which Profit   Co. would inherit all of Loss Co.’s tax attributes  (i.e., its $999,999 NOL deduction);29 (2) acquire the   stock   of Loss Co.   in either a taxable   purchase, a tax-free Type   B reorganization, or reverse  triangular   merger,   and later liquidate   Loss Co. under Section   332 thereby   inheriting its NOL carryforwards;2! (3) acquire   Loss Co.’s stock and   then   transfer its own assets   into Loss Co. in a Section   351 exchange;  UB VIER. Gy§ 1972 (a)(2), (b)(1)(A).  United States v.

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES   565  in that case Loss Co., now a wholly owned subsidiary of  Profit Co., can  operate the Profit business while   retaining its own NOLs; or (4) Loss Co.  can acquire the assets of   Profit   Co. in an acquisitive tax-free reorganization by  exchanging   enough Loss Co. stock to give the Profit   Co. shareholders virtually 100 percent ownership of Loss Co. The Profit   Co.  shareholders then will own Loss Co., which will own all of  old  Profit Co.’s  assets plus a $999,999 NOL carryforward.  Is something   wrong   here?   If Loss   Co. lost money,   should   its NOLs   be  available   to offset   Profit’s   future   income   or should   the use   of those   NOLs be limited   to offsetting later income   earned   by Loss?   Should   Profit be able  to   avoid   tax   on   $999,999   of its   future   income   by   acquiring   (or   being  acquired   by) the corporate   shell   of an   unsuccessful   business?  After   pondering   these   questions   for many   years,   and   trying   various statutory   solutions,   Congress   eventually   adopted   the   current   version   of  Section   382,22   which   is the   outgrowth   of decades   of study,   most   notably the   Subchapter   C Project   of the American   Law   Institute   and   the   Senate Finance   Committee   staff's   Subchapter   C report.?3  When   applicable,   Section   382   limits   the   use   of a loss   corporation’s  NOL   carryforwards   when   there   is a change   of ownership   of more   than   50  percent   of the stock   of that   company   over   a period   of three   years   or less.?4 Stating   this   general   rule   in the language   of the   Code,   the loss limitations are   triggered   only   after   an   “ownership   change,’25   which   is   either   an “owner   shift   involving   a   5-percent   shareholder”,   or   an   “equity   structure  shift,”26   coupled   with   a   more   than   50   percent   increase   in   the   stock  ownership   of “5-percent   shareholders”   which   occurs   during   a three-year  “testing   period”.27   If Section   382   is triggered,   it limits   the   use   by a “new loss   corporation”   of any   NOLs   of an   “old   loss   corporation”   for any   “post-  change   year”   (i.e., any   year   after the ownership   change).?8   In general,   the  taxable   income   of   a   new   loss   corporation   that   may   be   offset   by preacquisition   NOLs   is limited   to the   value   of the   old loss   corporation’s  stock   on   the   date   of the   ownership   change   multiplied   by   a   prescribed “long-term   tax-exempt   rate.”29   These   and   many   other   statutory   terms  will be explained   in detail   later   in the chapter.  22 See   generally   Jacobs, “Tax Treatment of Corporate   Net   Operating Losses   and   Other Tax Attribute   Carryovers,”   5  Va.

566  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  The   rationale   of Section   382   is to   allow   a   loss   company’s   NOLs   to  offset   only   the   future   income   generated   by that   company’s   business.   If the   section   is triggered   by an   ownership   change,   its limitations   apply   in  two   different   ways.   First,   if the   Loss   Co.   business   is not   continued   (or  substantially   all of its assets   are   not used)   for at least two   years   after the  change   of ownership,   all of its   NOLs   are   disallowed.2°   Second,   if the Loss Co.   business   is continued   or   if its assets   are   used   for at least   two   years,  the   losses   are   allowable   only to the   extent   of the   income   generated   from  the   old   Loss   Co.’s   assets.   Because   the   transactions   that   trigger   Section  382   may   involve   the   combining   of   a   loss   company   with   a   profitable  company,   it may   be   impossible   to   determine   exactly   what   part   of the combined   company’s   income   is generated   by the   Loss   Co.’s   business   or assets.   Section   382   solves   this   problem   by   adopting   a   method   to  approximate   Loss   Co.’s   income.   It irrebuttably   assumes   that   the   return  on   Loss   Co.’s   equity   will be the   rate   of return   payable   on   long-term   tax- exempt   bonds.   Thus,   in   any   year,   Loss   Co.’s   NOLs   can   be   used   by the combined   company   only   to   the   extent   of   the   value   of   old   Loss   Co.  multiplied   by an   assumed   return   on   equity   known   as   the   long-term   tax- exempt   rate.3!   These   basic   rules   are   augmented   by   attribution   rules, technical   adjustments   and   a   swarm   of anti-avoidance   provisions   that give new   dimension   to Congressional   paranoia.  Our study of Section   382 begins   with an examination of the  ownership   change   requirement and then turns to the effect of such a  change on the ability to use Loss Co.’s NOL carryforwards.  2. THE OWNERSHIP   CHANGE   REQUIREMENTS  Code: § 382(g), (i), (kK), (D(8) & (4). See § 318.  In  General.   Since   the economic   burden of corporate losses falls on the persons who were   shareholders when the corporation   was losing money,  the Section   382   limitations   do not intercede as long as those   investors  continue as shareholders. After all, they suffered through the losses, so  it is only fair  to give them the benefit of the accompanying tax deductions.  Consequently, Section   382   applies   only if there is an “ownership change,”  which occurs if the percentage of Loss Co.   stock owned   by one or more “5-  percent   shareholders”   increases by   more   than 50 percentage points32 during the three-year “testing   period.”33 Thus, if Profit   Co. purchases 51  percent or more of Loss Co.’s stock within a three-year period, or   if Loss  Co. is acquired in a corporate   reorganization   and its   ownership   changes  by  more   than 50 percent,   the loss limitations will apply.   Similarly, if ten  unrelated   investors   each   purchase six percent of  the   Loss Co.   stock  Section   382   applies.  31 .R.C.   § 382(b)(1).  2   LR.C.  § 382(g)(1), 83 Id.

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  These various types of ownership changes are divided by the  statute  into two categories: an “owner shift involving a 5-percent shareholder”  and an “equity   structure shift.”34 An “owner shift” generally occurs upon  any change in the   stock ownership (either an increase or a decrease) of any 5-percent or more   shareholder (e.g., the taxable purchases illustrated  above).35 An “equity   structure shift” includes tax-free reorganizations,  certain   public offerings and   reorganization-type transactions   such as  cash   mergers.36 Owner   Shift   Involving   5-Percent   Shareholder.   An   owner   shift involving   a   5-percent   shareholder   is   any   change   in   stock   ownership  (increase   or   decrease)   that   affects   the   percentage   of stock   owned   by any  person   who   is a 5-percent   shareholder   before   or   after   the change.37   Most  owner   shifts   are   purchases.   Thus,   if Profit   Co.   purchases   10   percent   of  Loss   Co.   stock   from   one   shareholder,   an   owner   shift has   occurred.   Apart  from   purchases,   owner   shifts   can   occur   as   a   result   of   Section   351  exchanges,   redemptions,   issuances   of   stock,   or   recapitalizations.38  However,   the   statute   specifically   excludes   owner   shifts   as   a result   of a  gift,   death   or   divorce   transfer.   Changes   in   proportionate   ownership  attributable   solely to fluctuations   in the market   value   of different   classes  of   stock   also   are   disregarded,   except   to   the   extent   provided   in  regulations.4° Keep   in   mind   that   a   single   “owner   shift”   is not   enough   to   trigger Section   382;   there   also   must   be   a   more   than   50   percent   change   in  ownership   of Loss   Co.4!1   And   while   a   more   than   50   percentage   point  change   in ownership   is an   essertial   ingredient   in the   Section   382   recipe, it is not   the   only one.   Here   is where   the   “5-percent   shareholder”   concept  enters   the   scene.   Consider,   for example,   the consequences   of a simple   50  percent   change   in ownership   rule   to a publicly   traded   company   that   has  loss   carryforwards.   Those   NOLs   might   be limited   as   a result   of random public   trading   if more   than   50 percent   of the company’s   shares   happened  to   change   hands   during   a   three-year   period.   To   preclude   such a result,  the type   of “owner   shift” required   to trigger   Section   382   occurs   only if the percentage   of   stock   of   Loss   Co.   owned   by   one   or   more   “5-percent shareholders”   increases   by the requisite   50 percent.”  34.

568  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  A   rule   that   only   counted   the   increased   ownership   of   5-percent  shareholders   might   be easily   circumvented.   For   example,   a shareholder who   held   all the Loss   Co.   stock   while   the losses   were   incurred   might   sell four   percent   interests   to   25   equal   purchasers   rather   than   to   a   single  individual.   In so   doing,   the owner   would   avoid   selling   any   of his   stock   to a   5-percent   shareholder   despite   an   obvious   sale   and   purchase   of tax benefits.   To assure   that the loss limitations   apply in these   circumstances,  Section   382   generally   treats   all less   than   5-percent   shareholders   as   a single   5-percent   shareholder.42   Thus,   the   sales   to   25   four   percent shareholders   in the   example   are   treated   as   sales   to   a   single   5-percent shareholder,   and   the   Section   382   limits   apply   because   that   5-percent shareholder’s   ownership   shifts   from   zero   percent   to   100   percent.   But   in the   earlier   publicly   traded   example,   the   group   of less   than   5-percent  shareholders   always   would   have   held   100   percent   both   before   and   after the transfers,   and   thus   Section   382   would   not   apply.   Unfortunately,   not all “owner   shifts”   are   the   result   of such   simple   purchases.   The   problems  at the end   of this   section   explore   some   of these   additional   complications.  Equity Structure Shifts. Recall   that Section   382 first must be  triggered by either   an “owner shift involving a 5-percent shareholder” or an “equity  structure shift,”44 either of which   must result  in an “ownership change.” An “equity   structure shift” is defined to include tax-free reorganizations*   and certain taxable “reorganization-type” transactions, public   offerings and similar   transactions.46 Consequently, if there is  a shift in the ownership of Loss Co. stock in a reorganization, which when combined with any other   stock transfers within the three-year   period results   in a more   than 50 percent change of ownership, such an equity structure shift  will bring the Section   382   limitations into  play.47  Special Rules for Determining   Change in Ownership. In determining whether a change in ownership has   occurred, reorganizations involve  some special complications. In a Type A or C reorganization, the  acquiring company that inherits   the loss is probably an   entirely   different  company from   Loss Co.   In   that   event, what   ownership is tested under Section 382?   This   question is answered indirectly by Section 382(k),  which defines   the “loss corporation” affected by Section   382 as the  corporation entitled to use   the loss   after the ownership change.48   Thus, in a Type A statutory merger or a Type   C stock-for-assets reorganization  involving a loss corporation   and   another   corporation,   the  limits apply to  3 L.R.C. § 382(g)(4)(A). “4 LR.C. § 382(g)(1).

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  the survivor.   In order to determine the extent of ownership   change that has occurred, the ownership of the surviving   corporation must be compared to the prereorganization ownership of the old Loss Co. In effect, the   statute   looks at the pre and   postreorganization ownership of whatever company possesses the losses—whether this is the acquiring  corporation or the target. For example, if Loss Co. is merged into   Profit Co., Section   382   requires a comparison of the ownership of premerger Loss Co. and postmerger Profit   Co. If the premerger Loss Co. shareholders own at least 50 percent of the postmerger Profit Co. (defined as “new loss corporation”)49 an ownership   change within the meaning of  Section 382(g) will not have occurred. On the other hand, if Loss Co.  acquires the   stock (in a Type   B reorganization or reverse triangular  merger) or assets (in a Type A or C reorganization, or   a forward triangular merger) of Profit   Co.   in exchange for Loss Co. stock, Section 382 will apply unless at least 50 percent of the postreorganization Loss Co. stock continues to be owned by the prereorganization Loss Co.  shareholders.  In order   to assure   proper   results   in the   context   of the   fusion   of two  corporations,   one   more   special rule is required.   All shareholders   who   own  less   than   five   percent   of   a company’s   stock   generally   are   treated   as   a single   5-percent   shareholder®®.   In a reorganization   (an “equity   structure shift”   for Section   382   purposes),   there   may   be at least   two   groups   of less than   5-percent   shareholders—in   our   examples,   the   shareholders   of Loss Co.   and   those   of Profit   Co.   If these   two   groups   were   treated   as   a single shareholder,   virtually   all   reorganizations   of   publicly   held   companies would   escape   Section   382.   For   example,   assume   that   Loss   Co.   and   Profit Co.   are   both   public   companies,   with   no   shareholder   owning   stock   of both and   no   individual   owning   (directly   or   indirectly)   five   percent   of either company.   If Profit   Co.   acquires   the Loss   Co.   assets   in a merger   pursuant to which   the old Loss   Co.   shareholders   receive   enough   Profit   Co.   stock   to  become,   as a group,   15 percent   shareholders   of Profit   Co., it would   appear that   Section   382   should   apply   because   the   Profit   Co.   shareholders   went  from   zero   to 85 percent   ownership   of the “new   loss corporation.”   But   if all  less-than-5-percent   shareholders   of Loss   Co.   and   Profit   Co.   are   treated  as   a single   shareholder,   100   percent   ownership   of Loss   Co. has   remained within   the   exclusive   ownership   of that   “single”   shareholder—i.e.,   the  group   of less than   5-percent   shareholders   owned   all of Loss   Co. and   all of Profit   Co.   and   still owns   all of Profit   Co.   In order   to assure   that   Section  382 will apply in this and   similar   situations,   the statute   segregates   public shareholders   by   providing   that   the   group   of   less   than   5-percent  shareholders   of   Profit   Co.   and   the   group   of   less   than   5-percent  shareholders   of Loss   Co.   are   treated   as   separate   shareholders.®!

570  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2 example, ownership of Loss Co. by the Profit   Co. shareholders will have  increased   from zero to 85 percent and Section   382   therefore will apply.  Attribution   Rules.   The   rules   outlined   above   are   buttressed   by a set of attribution   rules   that   borrows   from   and   expands   upon   the   attribution regime   of Section   318.52   In   general,   they   treat   all   stock   as   owned   by  individuals,   and   only   actual   or   constructive   ownership   by individuals   is  relevant   in testing   whether   an   ownership   change   has   taken   place   under  Section   382.   As   illustrated   by the   Garber   Industries   case,   which   follows,  the   attribution   rules   can   raise   challenging   issues   of   statutory  interpretation   even   in the   simplest   family   settings.  Garber   Industries   Holding   Co.   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Tax   Court,   2005.  VEY atketOSG'=  mw HALPERN,   J.  By notice   of deficiency   dated   June   21, 2001,   respondent   determined deficiencies   in petitioner’s   Federal   income   taxes   for petitioner’s   1997   and  1998   taxable   (calendar)   years   in the   amounts   of $4,916   and   $301,835, respectively.   The   parties   have   settled   all issues   save   one,   leaving   for our  decision   only the   question   of whether   a   1998   stock   sale between   siblings that   increased   one   sibling’s   percentage   ownership   of petitioner   by more than   50 percentage   points   resulted   in an   ownership   change   for purposes of section   382,   triggering   that   section’s   limitation   on   net   operating   loss (NOL)   carryovers.   That   issue   turns   on   the   interpretation   of   section  382(/)(3)(A)(i),   a matter   of first impression   for this   Court.  Unless   otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal  Revenue Code in effect   for 1998, and all Rule   references are to the Tax  Court   Rules of Practice and   Procedure.   For the sake of convenience, all  percentages are rounded to the nearest full percent.  FINDINGS   OF   FACT  SEL  At the time of  petitioner’s incorporation in December 1982, Charles M.   Garber, Sr. (Charles), and his brother, Kenneth R. Garber, Sr.  (Kenneth) (collectively, sometimes, the Garber brothers), owned 68  percent   and 26   percent,   respectively, of  petitioner’s common stock. The spouses,   children, and other   siblings   of the Garber ‘brothers owned the  remaining shares of such stock. The   Garber brothers’   parents, who are deceased,   never owned any of  petitioner’s   stock.  On or about   July 10, 1996,   petitioner underwent a reorganization described   in   section   368(a)(1)(D)   (the reorganization). Pursuant to the reorganization,   petitioner   canceled   Charles’s   original   stock   certificate   for  3,492.85   shares   and   issued a new certificate   to him for 386   shares.   As a  2   LR.C.  § 382(0(3).

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  result, Charles’s percentage ownership of petitioner decreased from 68 percent to 19 percent, and   Kenneth’s percentage ownership of petitioner  increased   from 26 percent to 65   percent. On April 1, 1998, Kenneth sold all of  his shares in petitioner to Charles (the 1998 transaction). As a result of the 1998 transaction,  Charles’s percentage ownership of petitioner increased   from 19 percent  to 84 percent. On   its   1998   consolidated   Federal   income   tax   return,   petitioner  claimed   an   NOL   deduction   in   the   amount   of $808,935   for   regular   tax  purposes   and   $728,041   for alternative   minimum   tax   (AMT)   purposes.   As  one   of the   adjustments   giving   rise   to   the   deficiencies   here   in question,  respondent   adjusted   the   amount   of petitioner’s   1998   NOL   deduction,   for  both   regular   tax   and   AMT   purposes,   to   $121,258   pursuant   to   section  382(b).   Petitioner   assigns   error   to that   adjustment. OPINION  I.   Substantive   Law A.   Overview   of Section   382  Section   382(a)   limits   the   amount   of   “pre-change   losses”   that   a  corporation   (referred   to as   a loss   corporation)   may   use   to offset   taxable income   in the   taxable   years   or   periods   following   an   ownership   change. “Pre-change   losses”   include   NOL   carryovers   to the taxable   year   in which  the   ownership   change   occurs   and   any   NOL   incurred   during   that   taxable year   to the   extent   such   NOL   is allocable   to the portion   of the year   ending  on   the date   of the ownership   change.   Sec.   382(d)(1).   An   ownership   change  is deemed   to have   occurred   if, on   a required   measurement   date   (a testing  date),   the   aggregate   percentage   ownership   interest   of one   or   more   5- percent   shareholders   of the   loss   corporation   is more   than   50   percentage points   greater   than   the   lowest   percentage   ownership   interest   of such shareholder(s)   during   the   (generally)   3-year   period   immediately  preceding   such   testing   date   (the testing   period).   Sec.   382(g)(1)   and   (2), (i); sec.   1.382—2(a)(4),   Income   Tax   Regs.  B. Determining Stock Ownership for Purposes of Section   382  Section 382(J)(3)(A) provides that, with certain   exceptions,   the constructive ownership rules   of section 318   apply in determining stock  ownership. Under the first of those   exceptions, set forth   in section 382(1)(3)(A)(i),   the family   attribution   rules   of  section   318(a)(1) and (5)(B)  do   not   apply;   instead,   an   individual   and all members of   his family  ‘described in   section   318(a)(1)   (spouse,   children, grandchildren,   and  parents) are treated as one   individual.  C.   Regulations  The   family   aggregation rule   of   section   382(1)(3)(A)(@) is further  addressed in   section   1.382-2T(h)(6),   Temporary   Income   Tax   Regs., 52  Fed.Reg.   29686   (Aug.   11,   1987).   Paragraph (h)(6)(i)   of   that   section  repeats   the   general   rule   that,   for  purposes   of section   382,   an   individual  571

--- Page 642 ---

572  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  and all members of his family   described in section 318(a)(1) are treated  as one individual.¢ Paragraph (h)(6)(iv) provides further that, if an individual may be treated as a member of more than one family under  paragraph (h)(6)(ii), such   individual will be treated as a member of the family   with the smallest   increase in percentage ownership (to the ©  exclusion of all other families).  II.   Arguments   of the Parties  A.   Petitioner’s   Argument  Petitioner   argues   that,   although   siblings   are   not   family   members  described   in   section   318(a)(1),   Charles   and   Kenneth   are   nonetheless  members   of   the   same   family   when   such   determination   is   made   by reference   to their   parents   and   grandparents.   That   is, as   sons,   they   are  both   members   of each   family   consisting   of a   parent   and   that   parent’s  family   members   described   in section   318(a)(1).   Similarly,   as   grandsons,  they   are   both   members   of each   family   consisting   of a   grandparent   and  that   grandparent’s   family   members   described   in   section   318(a)(1). Accordingly,   petitioner   argues,   Charles   and   Kenneth   are   treated   as   one  individual   under   section   382(/)(3)(A)(i),   with   the   result   that   transactions  between   them   are   disregarded   for purposes   of section   382.  B.   Respondent’s   Argument  Respondent maintains that   the family aggregation rule applies solely with   reference to living individuals. Under that view, inasmuch as  none of the parents and grandparents of the Garber brothers was alive at the commencement of the 3-year testing period immediately preceding  the 1998 transaction, from that   point forward there was no individual, within the meaning of section   382(/)(3)(A)@), whose family members (as described in section   318(a)(1)) included   both Charles   and   Kenneth. It follows, respondent argues,   that Charles   and Kenneth are not treated as  one individual for purposes of section 382 and that   the 1998   transaction  resulted in an ownership   change with   respect to petitioner under section  382.  III.   Analysis A.   General   Principles   of Statutory   Construction  . As a general   matter, if the language of a statute is unambiguous on  its face, we   apply the statute in accordance   with its terms, without resort  to extrinsic interpretive aids such as legislative   history. ** * Accordingly, our initial inquiry is whether the language of   section  382(1)(3)(A)(i) is  so plain as   to permit   only  one reasonable   interpretation insofar as the question   presented in  this   case is concerned. * *  * .

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES 573  threshold   determination   must be made with   reference to the context in  which such language appears. Id. B.   Language   of Section   382(J)(3)(A)(1)  Section   382(1)(3)(A)(i)   provides   as   follows: (A)   Constructive   ownership.—Section   318   (relating   to  constructive   ownership   of   stock)   shall   apply   in   determining ownership   of stock,   except   that—  (i)   paragraphs   (1)   and   (5)(B)   of section   318(a)   shall not   apply   and   an   individual   and   all members   of his family described   in paragraph   (1) of section   318(a)   shall be treated as   1 individual   for purposes   of applying   this   section   * * *  Respondent   apparently   would   limit   our   textual   analysis   to a single  word.   According   to   respondent,   Charles   and   Kenneth   are   not   common  members   of   any   individual's   family   under   section   382(/)(3)(A)(i)  “[b]ecause   the   commonly   used   meaning   of the   term   ‘individual’   does   not  include   a deceased   parent”.   We   believe   respondent’s   focus   is too narrow.  As   stated   by the   Court   of Appeals   for the   Fifth   Circuit: However,   even   apparently   plain   words,   divorced   from   the context   in which   they arise   and   in which   their creators   intended  them   to   function,   may   not   accurately   convey   the   meaning   the  creators   intended   to   impart.   It   is   only,   therefore,   within   a context   that   a word,   any   word,   can   communicate   an   idea.  Leach   v.   FDIC,   860   F.2d   1266,   1270   (5th   Cir.1988).   In   our   view,   the  question   is not   whether   the   noun   “individual”,   standing   alone,   typically  denotes   a   living   person—typically   it   does.   The   question,   rather,   is  whether   the   language   of section   382(J)(3)(A)G)   as   a   whole   definitively establishes,   one   way   or   the   other,   that   the   identification   of a   (living)  individual   whose   family   members   are   aggregated   thereunder   must   be  made,   as   respondent   maintains   (or   need   not   be   made,   as   petitioner maintains),   coincident   with   the   determination   of stock   ownership   under section   382   (i.e., on   a testing   date   or at any   point during a testing period). Stated   negatively,   is the   language   of section   382(/)(3)(A)(@)   so plain   as   to  preclude   either   party’s   position,   as   so identified?  We are   satisfied   that   the language of   section   382(/)(3)(A)(@) can  variably   (and   reasonably) be   interpreted as being   consistent   with   each party’s   position in  this   case. That is, there is nothing in  the language of  the   statute   that would   make either   party’s   position   patently   untenable.  While a rule attributing   stock owned   by an   individual on a measurement  date to members of  his family   presupposes that   the   individual is  alive,  the same   need not   be   said   of a rule   (such as that   contained in   section  382(1)(3)(A)())   that  identifies   (by reference to an  individual)   the members of  a family   that,   on some   measurement date,   are   to be treated as   a single  shareholder.   By the   same   token,   the   language of section   382(1)(3)(A)() certainly   does   not  compel   the  conclusion   that the individual   whose   family  members   are   so   aggregated   need   not be  alive   on   that   measurement   date.

--- Page 644 ---

574  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Because the answer to our inquiry is not apparent from the face of the statute, we may look beyond the language of section 382(/)(3)(A)@) for  interpretive guidance.  C.   Legislative   History   of Section   382()(3)(A)() Congress   enacted   the   family   aggregation   rule   of   section  382(1)(8)(A)()   as   part   of its overhaul   of section   382   included   in the   Tax  Reform   Act   of   1986,   **   *   The   rule   first   appeared   in   the   conference committee   bill.   The   conference   committee   report   that   accompanied   that bill (the   1986   conference   report)   does   not   address   the   temporal   aspect   of family   aggregation   identified   above:   “The   family   attribution   rules   of  sections   318(a)(1)   and   318(a)(5)(B)   do   not   apply,   but   an   individual,   his  spouse,   his   parents,   his   children,   and   his   grandparents   are   treated   as   a  single   shareholder.”   H.   Conf.   Rept.   99-841   (Vol.II),   at   II-182   (1986),  1986-3   C.B.   (Vol.4)   1, 182.10  D.   Other   Considerations  1.   Family   Aggregation   Under   Pre-1986   Act   Section   382  a.   General   Structure   of the   Statute  Prior to the amendment of section 382 by the 1986 Act,   section 382 contained   separate rules for ownership   changes resulting from purchases and   redemptions, see former sec. 382(a), and those   resulting from  corporate   reorganizations, see former sec. 382(b). Under the “purchase” rules   of former section   382(a), ownership   changes were   ascertained by reference to the holdings of the 10 largest shareholders at the end of the corporation’s   taxable   year (as compared to their holdings at the  beginning of such   taxable   year or the preceding taxable year). Former sec. 382(a)(1) and (2).  b. Family Attribution and Aggregation Intrafamily sales were   excluded   from the operation of former section  382(a) by means of stock attribution (as opposed to shareholder  aggregation) rules. Specifically, purchases of stock from   persons whose stock ownership   would be   attributed to the purchaser   under the family attribution rules   of section 318   were   ignored for purposes of determining whether an ownership   change   by  “purchase”   had occurred.   See   former  sec. 382(a)(3) and (4). Although family members were   potentially   subject  to aggregation for purposes of determining the   10  largest shareholders at year-end, that   rule applied   only if loss corporation stock owned   by one was   attributed to the   other under the family   attribution   rules   of  section 318. Former sec. 382(a)(2) and (3). For   that   reason,   the aggregation rule of former section   382(a)(2), unlike   the aggregation rule   of   section 382(/)(3)(A)(i), necessarily   applied as of   the   date   on which stock ownership   was measured (in  the case   of former   section   382(a)(2),   at year

--- Page 645 ---

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  end). Accordingly, no inference can be drawn from   former section 382(a)(2) as to whether, as respondent maintains, the   identification of  the individuals whose family members are aggregated   under section  382(2)(3)(A)(@) occurs as of the date on which stock ownership is measured.  2. Practical Consequences of Each Party’s Interpretation of Section  382(0)(3)(A)D)  a.   Petitioner’s   Interpretation  Under   petitioner’s   interpretation   of   section   382(/)(3)(A)(i),   an individual   would   be   aggregated   with   (and   therefore   could,   without   any section   382   consequences,   sell   loss   corporation   shares   to) not   only   his  spouse,   children,   grandchildren,   and   parents,   but   also   his   siblings,  nephews,   nieces,   grandparents,   in-laws,   great-grandchildren,   aunts, uncles,   first   cousins,   and   great-grandparents.!?   It is difficult   to believe that   Congress   intended   to   expand   the   scope   of exempted   intrafamily  sales   so   significantly   (as compared   to both   the   then-existing   version   of  section   382,   see   supra   part III.D.1.b.,   and   the House   and   Senate   versions of revised   section   382,   see   supra   note   9) with   nary   a   mention   of that objective   in the   27   pages   devoted   to section   382   in the   1986   conference  report.  b.   Respondent’s   Interpretation  Respondent’s   interpretation   of section   382()(3)(A)()   is perhaps   even  more   troubling   than   petitioner’s.   First,   it has   the potential   for being just  as   expansive   as   petitioner’s   interpretation.43   More   importantly,  respondent’s   interpretation   leads   to arbitrary   distinctions.   As relevant   to this case,   respondent   would   have   us believe   that   the ability of siblings   to  sell   loss   corporation   shares   among   themselves   without   any   section   382  consequences   is wholly   dependent   on   the   continued   good   health   of their parents.   We   see   no   rational   basis   for   Congress’s   having   drawn   a distinction   in this   context   between   siblings   whose   parents   happen   to be  living and   those   whose   parents   happen   to be deceased;   the   former   are   no  more   related   than   the latter.  12 As a member of each   parent’s   family (i.e., in his capacity as a child   of those   parents),  an individual would be aggregated with his parents’   children (his  siblings), grandchildren (his nephews and nieces), and   parents (his grandparents).   As a member of  his spouse’s   family (..e.,  in his capacity as her   spouse),   an   individual would be aggregated with his spouse’s   parents (his mother-and father-in-law). As a member of each child’s family (i.e., in his capacity as   a parent of those   children),   an   individual would be aggregated with   each child’s spouse (his sons-and  daughters-in-law)   and   grandchildren (his great-grandchildren).   As a member   of each  grandparent’s   family (i.e., in his capacity as   a grandchild of  those   grandparents), an individual  would be  aggregated   with his grandparents’   children (his aunts   and uncles), grandchildren (his  first cousins),   and   parents (his great-grandparents).   See secs.   382(1)(3)(A)(i),   318(a)(1).  13 Respondent’s   interpretation   of the   statute   differs from   petitioner’s   in that  respondent  would   require   that   the   relevant   parent,   spouse,   child,   or grandparent of the   individual in  question   be  living  when   stock   ownership is measured.   See   supra   note   12.  575

576  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  E.   A Third   Interpretation 1.   Introduction Our   own   analysis   of the legislative   evolution   of section   382(/)(3)(A)Q@) leads   us   to believe   that   both   parties   have   erroneously   interpreted   that provision.   For   the   reasons   discussed   below,   we   conclude   that   Congress  most   likely   intended   the   aggregation   rule   of   section   382(/)(3)(A)@)   to apply   solely from   the perspective   of individuals   who   are   shareholders   (as  determined   under   the   attribution   rules   of section   382(1)(8)(A))   of the   loss corporation.!4   In practical   terms,   our   conclusion   dictates   that   we   sustain respondent’s   determination   in this   case,   even   though   we   disagree   with  his interpretation   of the   statute.  2.   1986   Act   Revisions   to Section   382  a.   Relevant   Fundamental   Changes   to the   Statute Among   other   things,   section   621(a)   of the   1986   Act   replaced   the “purchase”   rules   of former   section   382(a)   with   the   concept   of the   “owner shift”,   defined   broadly   to include   any   change   in the respective   ownership  of the stock   of a corporation.   Sec.   382(g)(2)(A).   The   occurrence   of an   owner  shift involving   a 5-percent   shareholder,   see   sec.   382(g)(2)(B),   (k)(7), is one of two   occasions   for   opening   the   corporation’s   stock   transfer   books   to  determine   whether   the   aggregate   percentage   ownership   interest   of one  or   more   such   shareholders   has   increased   by   more   than   50   percentage points   within   the   relevant   “lookback”   (testing)   period.15   See   sec.  382(g)(1),   G). While   the   owner   shift   “trigger”   presupposes   some   type   of  transaction   in the stock   of the loss corporation,   see   H.   Conf.   Rept.   99-841  (Vol.II),   supra   at   II-174,   1986-3   C.B.   (Vol.4)   at   174,   the   requisite  increase   in stock   ownership   within   the   resulting   testing   period   need   not  be attributable   to a purchase,   redemption,   or, indeed,   any   transaction   in  which   shares   actually   change   hands,   see   sec.   382(g)(1)(A)   and   (B). b. Consequences for Family Attribution: Changes in Family Status Under a system in which an increase in one’s percentage ownership of a corporation   need not be  associated   with a transaction in which shares actually change hands, a straightforward application of the family attribution   rules of section   318(a)   could produce “artificial” ownership increases; i.e., ownership increases solely attributable to changes in  family status. For   instance, under the   attribution rules, the ownership _ percentage of  an individual who marries the sole shareholder of a loss corporation would   thereby   increase   from zero to 100   percent. If the wedding occurred   during a testing   period   (which   could   be   triggered, for instance, by the subsequent   issuance of  a relatively   small number of  additional   shares to   a key   employee),   then   the   increase   in   the  ee   eee   ee a In other words,   composite   shareholders are   to be  constructed   only around   individuals who directly or indirectly   (through an   entity or by means of an   option) own   shares of  the   loss  corporation.  thie other  such   occasion is the  occurrence   of  an   equity   structure shift   (in general,   most  corporate   reorganizations).   See sec. 382(g)(1),   (8

--- Page 647 ---

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  nonshareholder spouse’s deemed ownership percentage would result in an ownership change. A similar result presumably would occur if the shareholder legally adopted someone during a testing period. See sec.  318(a)(1)(B).  c.   House   Bill Provision   Regarding   Changes   in Family   Status  The   House   version   of revised   section   382   provided   that   the   family attribution   rule   of section   318(a)(1)   would   apply   “by   assuming   that   the family   status   as   of the   close   of the   testing   period   was   the   same   as   the family   status   as   of the   beginning   of the   testing   period”.   H.R.   3838,   99th Cong.,   1st   Sess.   sec.   321(a)   (1985)   (provision   designated   as   sec. 382(n)(3)(A)).   Although   the report   of the   Committee   on   Ways   and   Means accompanying   the   House   bill provides   no   additional   insight,   see   H. Rept. 99-426,   at 266   (1985),   1986-3   C.B.   (Vol.2)   1, 266,   the   practical   effect   of that   provision   would   have   been   to eliminate   the possibility   that   a change in family   status   during   a testing   period   could,   in and   of itself, contribute  to   an   ownership   change.!7   The   conference   committee,   in   addition   to substituting   family   aggregation   for   family   attribution,   dropped   the  provision   in the   House   bill regarding   changes   in family   status.18  d.   Observations  In the   context   of the   parties’   arguments   in this case,   the   conference committee’s   excision   of the   House   bill   provision   regarding   changes   in  family   status   is   somewhat   puzzling.   Specifically,   under   each   party’s  interpretation   of   section   382(/)(3)(A)G),   the   family   aggregation   rule  adopted   by the   conferees   would   produce   the   same   “artificial”   ownership  increases   that   the   House   bill   provision   eliminated   in   the   context   of attribution.   In   terms   of our   marriage   hypothetical,   the   addition   of the  shareholder   spouse   to the nonshareholder   spouse’s   family unit during the  testing   period   would   increase   the   ownership   percentage   of that   family  unit   by 100   percentage   points   during   that   period.   If, however,   the   family aggregation   rule   applies   solely   from   the   perspective   of shareholders   of the   loss   corporation,   there   would   be   no   separate   family   unit   headed   by the   nonshareholder   spouse   in our   hypothetical   and,   consequently,   (1) no increase   in ownership   attributable   to the   marriage,   and   (2) no   need   for the   remedial   provision   contained   in   the   House   bill.   Under   that  interpretation   of the family   aggregation   rule, the conference   committee's  excision   of the   House   bill’s family   status   provision   makes   perfect   sense.  17 Returning to our marriage hypothetical, under the House bill’s provision,   the   couple’s  relationship on   the   testing   date would   have   been deemed to be   the same as it was at the  beginning of   the   testing   period (i.e., not   married),   with   the   result   that   the nonshareholder  spouse’s ownership   percentage   would   have   been   deemed to be zero throughout the   testing period.  18 The   Senate   version   of  the bill contained   no   such   provision,   providing   instead for  the  application   of  the   family   attribution   rules   of sec. 318   without   modification.   H.R.   3838,   99th  Cong.,   2d  Sess.   sec. 621(a)   (1986)   (provision   designated as   sec.   382(k)(3)(A)).  577

578  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  3.   Revisiting   the Language   of the   Statute That   our   interpretation   of section   382(J)(3)(A)@)   provides   a   cogent  explanation   for the conference   committee’s   action   is of   no   consequence   if a   plain   reading   of the   statute   does   not   permit   that   interpretation.   See  supra   part   III.A.   The   use   of   the   term   “individual”   in   section  382(1)(3)(A)(i),   however,   does   not   preclude   a   contextual   interpretation pursuant   to which   the   set of individuals   contemplated   by Congress   (i.e.,  individuals   who   own   shares   of the   loss   corporation)   is smaller   than   the  universe   of   all   possible   individuals   (i.e.,   all   living   beings).   More  importantly,   we   are   satisfied   that   our   interpretation   proceeds   from   an  entirely natural   reading   of the statute.   Given   a stock   ownership   rule that  operates   by reference   to an   individual   and   other   persons   who   are   defined  in terms   of their   relationship   to that   individual,   it is hardly   a stretch   to surmise   that   the   rule   presupposes   the   shareholder   status   of   the referenced   individual.  4.   Revisiting   the   1986   Conference   Report  Having concluded that our interpretation of section 382(1)(3)(A)(i) does not do  violence to the plain language of the statute, we return to the legislative history to determine whether it is any more supportive of our view   than it is of the views of the parties. As indicated   above, see supra part III.C. and note 10, the 1986   conference report contradicts the statutory language   by including an individual’s grandparents (rather  than his grandchildren) among the family members who are aggregated for purposes of section 382. If that disconnect   were attributable to a simple   typographical error, one might   reasonably expect that   the  subsequently issued   report of the   Joint Committee on Taxation  explaining the 1986   Act (the   so-called Blue   Book) would point out the  error. See, e.g., Staff of Joint Comm. on Taxation, General   Explanation  of Tax Legislation Enacted in the 104th Congress at 81   n.59 (J. Comm.  Print 1996), (noting   that   the conference report accompanying H.R.   3448, the bill eventually   enacted as the Small   Business Job   Protection   Act of  1996, mistakenly refers to the  lessee rather than the  lessor   in the context  of new section 168(i)(8)). The Blue Book for the 1986 Act, however,  retains   the  reference in the 1986   conference report to “grandparents” in  the   context of  section   382(/)(3)(A)().   Staff   of Joint Comm. on Taxation,  General   Explanation of  the Tax   Reform Act of 1986 at 311 (J. Comm.  Print   1987).   *  As is the case with the conference   committee’s excision of  the family status   provision of   the House bill, see supra part ITI.E.2.d.,. the  substitution of “grandparents” for “grandchildren” in  the 1986   conference  report makes perfect   sense if the   family   aggregation rule   applies   solely  from   the   perspective of individuals who are shareholders of   the loss corporation.   Section   318(a)(1) (to which section   382(/)(3)(A)(i)   refers)   is  phrased in terms   of  the  family members (spouse,   children,   grandchildren,  and parents)   from   whom shares   are   attributed.   The   converse   of  that   rule  is that  shares   owned   by  an   individual   are   attributed to that individual’s

--- Page 649 ---

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES   579  spouse,   parents, grandparents,   and children. The substitution of  “grandparents” for “grandchildren” in the 1986   conference report  (reiterated in the 1986   Blue Book) therefore suggests that Congress  intended individuals to be aggregated with the same family members to whom their shares would otherwise be  attributed under section 318(a)(1), which in turn suggests that Congress intended the family aggregation  rule to apply   from the perspective of individuals who are shareholders of  the loss corporation.2°  5.   Revisiting   the   Regulations  Having   concluded   that   our   interpretation   of the   family   aggregation  rule   (1) does   not   violate   the   plain   meaning   rule,   and   (2) arguably   finds support   in   the   legislative   history   of   section   382(l)(8)(A)G),   we   would  nonetheless   be   hard   pressed   to   adopt   that   interpretation   if it   were  inconsistent   with   respondent’s   17-year-old   “legislative”   regulations.   See,  e.g.,   Chevron,   U.S.A.,   Inc.   v.   Natural   Res.   Def.   Council,   Inc.,   467   U.S. 837,   843-844,   104   S.Ct.   2778,   81 L.Ed.2d   694   (1984);   see   also   sec.   382(m)  (directing   the   Secretary   to   “prescribe   such   regulations   as   may   be  necessary   or   appropriate   to carry   out   the   purposes   of this   section”).   As   is  the   case   with   the   statute,   see   supra   part   III.E.3.,   the   language   of the  relevant   regulation   presents   no   such   obstacle.   See   sec.   1.8382—2T(h)(6),  Temporary   Income   Tax   Regs,   supra   at 29686. Nor   does   our   interpretation   of the   statute   render   superfluous   the “tiebreaker”   rule of paragraph   (h)(6)(iv)   of the above-cited   regulation.   See  supra   note   19.   To   the   contrary,   that   rule   serves   the   useful   purpose   of  precluding   purely   “vicarious”   ownership   increases   that   could   otherwise  occur   under   our   interpretation   of the   statute   (as   well   as   those   of the parties).   For   instance,   if a husband   and   wife   each   own   shares   of a loss  corporation,   and   the   husband   purchases   additional   shares   from   his mother,   the ownership   percentage   of the family   unit centered   on   the wife would   increase   as   a   result   of the   otherwise   exempt   transaction.2!   The tiebreaker   rule   precludes   that   result   by treating   the wife   as   a member   of the   family   unit   centered   on   her   husband   rather   than   a   member   of the  family   unit   centered   on   her,   since   such   inclusion   would   result   in   the smallest   increase   (zero)   in percentage   ownership.22   See   supra   part   I.C.;  supra   note   21.  20 We do   not mean to suggest that sec. 382(1)(3)(A)(i) should   be   interpreted as  incorporating a modified   version of sec. 318(a)(1) (.e., one   that   substitutes grandparents for -grandchildren);   such an interpretation presumably   would violate   the   plain meaning rule. See  supra   part III.A. 21 Since   the purchased shares   would be   included in   the holdings of  the   family unit  centered on   the husband both   before and after   the sale, the percentage   ownership of  the  husband-centric   family   unit would   remain   unchanged.   However, since   the purchased shares would not  be  included in  the  holdings of  the  family   unit  centered on   the wife   until   after  the sale, the   percentage   ownership of  the   wife-centric   family   unit would   increase as   a result   of  the sale.  A similar   result would occur if the   purchaser’s child   (rather   than his wife)   were a shareholder.  22 As is the   case   with   changes in  family   status,   see supra   note   16, this problem did   not  arise   under   former sec.   382(a),   since   the   “vicarious”   ownership   increase   would   not   have   been  attributable   to a  purchase   by  the  wife.   See   former sec.   382(a)(1)(B)Q).

580 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  IV.   Conclusion We   hold   that   the   family   aggregation   rule   of section   382(/)(3)(A)(@)  applies   solely   from   the   perspective   of individuals   who   are   shareholders  (as determined   under   the   attribution   rules   of section   382(/)(3)(A))   of the loss corporation.   Inasmuch   as an   individual   shareholder’s   family consists  solely   of   his   spouse,   children,   grandchildren,   and   parents   for   these  purposes,   sibling   shareholders   are   not   aggregated   under   section 382(1)(3)(A)(j)   if none   of their   parents   and   grandparents   is a shareholder of the loss corporation.23   Since   Kenneth   and   Charles   were   not children   or  grandchildren   of an   individual   shareholder   of petitioner   at any   relevant  time,   they are   not   aggregated   for purposes   of applying   section   382   to the  facts   of   this   case.   It   follows   that   Charles’s   purchase   of   shares   from  Kenneth   in   1998   resulted   in   an   ownership   change   with   respect   to  petitioner   as   contemplated   in section   382(g).

RESULTS   OF AN   OWNERSHIP   CHANGE  Code:   § 382(a)—(f),   (h), ()(1) & (4).  In   General.   If an   ownership   change   occurs,   the   Section   382   loss  limitations   then   must   be applied.   Before   considering   any   further   details, the   function   of the   limitations   must   be   examined.   We   have   seen   that  Congress   designed   Section   382   to   prevent   taxpayers   from   selling   and purchasing   tax   deductions.   If that   were   the   only relevant   consideration, the   rest   would   be easy—whenever   there   is an   ownership   change,   simply  eliminate   all   loss   carryforwards.   But   our   study   of   Subchapter   C   has revealed   one   other   salient   factor—a   corporation   is treated   as   a separate entity   for   tax   purposes.   Although   the   individual   shareholder   may   bear  the ultimate   burden   or reap   the ultimate   benefit   of a corporation’s   losses or   profits,   it is the   corporation   itself   that   is the   focus   of the   corporate income   tax. In   Section   382,   Congress   has   adopted   a   principle   of   “neutrality” toward   a   loss   company.   While   the   Section   382   limitations   restrict trafficking   in deductions,   they permit   the purchaser   of a loss corporation to   use   that   corporation’s   net   operating   losses   to   offset   the   old   loss  corporation’s   own   subsequent   income.   What   Section   382   seeks   to prevent  is the   use   of a   corporation’s   losses   to   offset   another   taxpayer’s   income  after   an   ownership   change.   It is from   this policy that   the two   limitations  in Section   382   directly flow.  Continuity   of  Business   Enterprise Limit. The first limit is found in Section 382(c),53 which incorporates the continuity of business   enterprise doctrine®4 by disallowing all net operating loss carryovers if the old loss corporation   business is not continued for   at least two   years after the ownership change.®5   As   described in the reorganization regulations, continuity of business   enterprise   requires either   that   the   historic business of  the loss corporation   be continued for  at  least two   years or that  a significant   portion of its assets are used in some other   business carried  on by the new loss corporation.*® As a result, a corporation that  runs   afoul  of  this first limit   in  the second   year   following   an ownership   change   may  53 This limitation is inapplicable to the  extent of any built-in gains or gains resulting  from a Section   338   election as well as any   Section   382(b)(2)   carryovers   related to such   gains.   See  LR.C. § 382(c)(2) and p. 586,   infra.  54.   See   Chapter   9B1f,   supra. 55   =.R.C.   § 382(c)(1). 56   Reg.   § 1.368-1(d).

582  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  be required to amend its tax return for the earlier year and remove any  inherited NOL deductions that had been applied   against   taxable income.  The   Section   382   Limitation.   A   second,   more   complex   limitation   is “the   Section   382   limitation,”   under   which   losses   can   be used   in any   “post-   . change   year”   only   to   the   extent   of the   value   of the   old   loss   corporation  multiplied   by the   “long-term   tax-exempt   rate.”57   To   illustrate,   assume  Loss   Co.   has   a   value   of $200,000   and   has   losses   of $800,000   at   a   time  when   the   long-term   tax-exempt   rate   is 6   percent.   After   an   ownership  change,   New   Loss   Co.   may   use   its loss   carryforwards   only   to the   extent of $200,000   multiplied   by 6 percent,   or   $12,000   per   year.  The   theory   of this   limit   is to   allow   the   loss   carryforwards   to offset  any   income   earned   by   the   old   loss   business.   But   since   many   of   the  acquisitions   that   will trigger   the limit   involve   combining a loss business  with   some   other   more   profitable   enterprise,   it is impossible   to determine  exactly   how   much   income   will be generated   by the old company.   To   solve this   problem,   Section   382   irrebuttably   presumes   that   the   old   loss  business   will generate   income   on   its assets   at a predetermined   rate—the  long-term   tax-exempt   rate.   Because   the   amount   of   available   loss carryforwards   depends   on   the value   of the old loss   company,   the   greater  the value   (and cost) of that   company,   the   more   loss carryforwards   may   be  used   each   year.   Again,   the   objective   is   to   defer   use   of   the   loss carryforwards   by limiting   their   use   in any   one   year   to an   approximation  of the income   produced   in the year   by the old loss business.  Carryforwards of Unused Limitation. The Section   382   limitation  results in some further complexity if it exceeds a corporation’s   taxable income in a given post-change year. To illustrate, if Loss Co.   in the  example above, with a value of $200,000, had at least $12,000 of taxable  income (disregarding its NOL carryover),   the full $12,000 of NOLs that  were available in each   year after the change of ownership   would be used. But if the combined taxable income of the new loss company were only  $4,000,   the full amount available under the Section   382(b)(1)   limitation  would not be utilized. In   that   situation,   the $8,000 of available   but  unused NOLs may be  carried forward   and the  limitation in the following  year would be $20,000 (the sum of the regular   $12,000 limitation   plus the $8,000 carryover).58  Mid-Year   Ownership Change.   Another special   rule applies if the  “change date”59   occurs   on a date   other than the last day of a year. In that  event,   the   Section   382   limitation for the   portion of the   year after the change is  a prorated amount derived by  applying a ratio of  the remaining days in  the  year to the total days in  the  year.®9 Thus, if the change occurs  57 L.R.C. § 382(b)(1), (f). “Post-change year”  is i  date”—i.e., in  the   case   of let shift, dhe SatecoWhichHee   GAN Gane   ae   ar of an   equity   structure shift, the   date   of  the   reorganization.

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  two-thirds of the way through the year, the limitation for that year is  one-third of what otherwise would be   available—i.e., $12,000 x Y, or  $4,000 in the example above.®1  The Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate. Returning to the basic Section   382  limitation, recall that it is the value of the old loss corporation   multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. The use of this measure to predict the  expected return on Loss Co.’s assets is the product of substantial  Congressional debate.62 Loss Co. presumably can generate   earnings on  its assets at a rate at least equal to the higher federal long-term taxable  rate. Indeed, if it could not do so some other way,   Loss Co. simply could  sell   its assets and invest   the proceeds in long-term federal   obligations.  Use of the lower tax-exempt rate to predict Loss Co.’s earnings is intended to offset the fact that   the amount against which this rate is applied will exceed the real value of Loss Co.’s income-generating assets.  How so? Because under Section 382(e)(1), the value of Loss Co. is the  value of its stock immediately before the ownership change. Since   Loss Co. has loss carryforwards to offset any income it earns in the near  future,   that income will be  essentially tax-free. Loss Co.’s after-tax return will equal its before-tax profit, and the value of its stock will  reflect not only the value of its income-generating assets but also the fact that   the income   which is generated will be tax free.  The   Value   of the Company.   The   second   component   of the   Section   382 limitation   is the value   of the stock   of the old loss corporation   immediately  preceding   the   ownership   change.®*   Congress   included   several   special  rules   to guard   against   predictable   efforts   to abuse   this   rule   by inflating  the   value   of the   loss company.  One   obvious   technique   to   increase   the   available   NOLs   after   an ownership   change   would   be for the   shareholders   to increase   the value   of the   loss   company   just   prior   to the   change   by contributing   cash   or   other property   to   the   corporation.   Congress   attacked   this   maneuver   with   an “anti-stuffing”   rule,   under   which   the   value   of any   pre-change   capital contribution   received   by the   loss   company   as   part   of a plan   to increase the   Section   382   limitation   is disregarded.*4   Any   contribution   received within   two   years   before   an   ownership   change   is generally   treated   as part of such   a plan.®  61 In   addition,   the   limitation is inapplicable to the days of  the year prior to the change  date.   I.R.C. § 382(b)(3)(A).  ~ 62 The   long-term   tax-exempt rate is defined by Section 382(f) as the highest federal   long-  term rate determined   under Section   1274(d) in   effect   for the three-month period ending   with the month of the ownership change,   adjusted to reflect differences between returns on long-term  taxable   and   tax-exempt obligations.  68 J.R.C. § 382(b)(1), (e)(1). For  purposes of determining the  value of  the loss corporation, all stock is counted,   even   preferred   stock   that would be   ignored in determining   whether an  ownership   change   has   occurred.   I.R.C. §§  382(e)(1),   (k)(6)(A);   1504(a)(4).  64   TR.C.   § 382()(1).  6   TLR.C. § 382(1)(1)(B). Exempted   from this presumption are   any   contributions   to  be  specified   in  regulations.   The   Conference   Report   instructs   the Treasury   that   the   regulations  should   generally   exempt   contributions   only  if  they occurred   prior   to  the accrual   of the losses   or  583

584.   TAXATIONOR C   CORPORATIONS |   eitagelae  Even   without   “stuffing”   in   anticipation   of   a   planned   ownership change,   shareholders   of a loss company   may   be tempted   to transfer cash or   income-producing   investments   to   the   company.   If there   is   a   later ownership   change,   the   allowable   losses   then   would   be   greater;   and   if there   is not   a change,   the   investment   income   could   be   accumulated   tax- free   at   the   corporate   level   because   it   would   be   offset   by   the   loss carryforwards.   If   the   shareholders   do   not   wish   to   transfer   portfolio investments   to   the   loss   company,   they   at   least   might   be   tempted   to prevent   the company’s   profits   (assuming   it later becomes   profitable)   from  being   taken   out   of the   company   in   order   to   reinvest   these   profits   in portfolio   investments   which   can   accumulate   tax-free   at   the   corporate  level   and   be available   to increase   the   Section   382   limit   in the   event   of a  subsequent   ownership   change.  These   possibilities   did   not   go   unnoticed   by   an   ever   suspicious Congress.   If at   least   one-third   of a   loss   corporation’s   assets   consist   of nonbusiness   (i.e.,   investment)   assets,   the   value   of the   corporation   for  purposes   of Section   382   includes   only   the   percentage   of its   actual   net value   that   represents   the   percentage   of   its   gross   assets   which   are  business   assets.66   To   illustrate,   if Loss   Co.   has   $2,000,000   of investment  assets,   $3,000,000   of business   assets   and   $1,000,000   of debt,   it has   a net  value   of   $4,000,000,   but   only   60   percent   of   that   value   is   taken   into  account   for   purposes   of   the   Section   382   limitation   because   only   60 percent   of its gross   assets   are   business   assets.§7  If taxpayers are unable to increase useable NOLs by inflating   the  value of the loss corporation prior to an ownership change,   they might be  tempted to at least enable a profitable corporation to more easily   avail itself of these losses by decreasing the value of the loss corporation after an ownership change.   To illustrate, assume Loss Co. has a value of  $1,000,000   and loss carryforwards of $1,000,000   and the tax-exempt rate  is 6  percent. Profit   Co. could acquire   Loss Co. for $1,000,000   and use loss carryforwards at the rate   of $60,000 per year, which   probably   would be  enough only to offset Loss Co.’s own income.   But what if Profit   Co. pays  $510,000 for 51 percent of Loss Co., and   then   Loss Co. redeems the  remaining 49 percent of its outstanding shares?   Loss Co.’s value   has  decreased   by 49 percent (the amount paid to redeem its stock), and its revenues presumably will decrease by the same 49 percent. Profit   Co.  will  have   paid   only   $510,000,   but   the smaller New Loss Co. may deduct its loss carryovers to the  extent of 6  percent   times   $1,000;000, or $60,000 per  year. Once again, Congress cuts off  a promising strategy at the   pass.  oat were   contributions of necessary   operating capital. H.R.Rep. No. 99-841,   supra note 6, IT—  66 T.R.C. § 382(0)(4).  67 When it applies,   Section 382())(4)   specifically   requires   that   the   value of   the loss

--- Page 655 ---

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  Section 382(e)(2) provides that if a redemption or other corporate  contraction occurs in connection with an ownership change, the value of  the loss corporation is determined only after taking the redemption or  contraction into account.§8  Limit   on   Built-in   Losses.   Finally,   a corporation   generally   is subject to   the   Section   382   limitations   only   if   it   has   loss   carryforwards   or carryovers   of   disallowed   business   interest.6?   A   prospective   buyer   of  deductions   might   be tempted   to avoid   the   section   by simply   acquiring   an  asset   that   did   not   have   the   carryforwards   themselves   but   rather   the ability   to produce   them.   Specifically,   instead   of acquiring   a corporation that   had   loss   carryforwards,   a taxpayer   could   acquire   a corporation   that  had   substantial   unrealized   losses   and   other   deductions   built   into   its  assets.   Assuming   a buyer   is in the market   for deductions,   a company   with assets   having   an   aggregate   basis   of $1,000,000   and   a value   of $100,000  may   be   as   attractive   as   a   company   with   a   $900,000   loss   carryforward.  Once   the   company   is acquired,   the   profitable   company   could   sell   those  assets   and   use   the losses   against   its own   profits. In its eternal   race   to stay   one   step   ahead   of the taxpayer,   Congress  has   extended   the limitations   in Section   382   to certain   built-in   unrealized  losses   and   deductions   that   economically   accrue   prior   to   an   ownership change   but   are   not   recognized   until   after   the   change.7°   If a corporation  has   assets   whose   aggregate   bases   exceed   their   total   value—i.e.,   a   “net  unrealized   built-in   loss”71—then   any built-in   losses   which   are   recognized  within   five   years?2   of   an   ownership   change   are   treated   as   loss carryforwards   of the   old   loss   corporation   and   are   subject   to the   Section  382   deduction   limits.73   Depreciation,   amortization   or   depletion  deductions   during   the   five-year   recognition   period   are   treated   as  recognized   built-in   losses   for purposes   of this rule   unless   the corporation  establishes   that   such   amounts   are   not   attributable   to the   excess   of the  adjusted   basis   over   the   fair   market   value   of the   asset   on   the   change date.74   To the extent   that   the new   loss corporation   establishes   that   a loss  recognized   during   the   five-year   period   accrued   after   the   ownership change,   the   loss   may   be   deducted   without   limitation.”>   Even   if the   new  loss company   is unable   to establish   when   any   particular   loss was   accrued,  the   total   amount   of loss   subject   to   this   rule   may   not   exceed   the   net  68 The legislative   history suggests that   the “in connection with” standard   should be broadly   construed to include   any redemption that is contemplated at the time of  the ownership change.

Section   383   is   a   brief   section   that   is   easily   mastered   if   one  understands   the   operation   of   Section   382.   It   essentially   calls   for   the Treasury   to issue   regulations   that will adopt   the principles   of Section   382  (i.e.,   the   continuity   of business   enterprise   requirement   and   ownership  change   rules   coupled   with   limitations)   to limit   corporate   attributes   other  than   loss   carryforwards.   Section   383   applies   to   the   Section   39 carryforward   of   the   general   business   credit,85   the   Section   53  carryforward   of the   alternative   minimum   tax   credit,86   and   the   Section  904(c)   carryforward   of the   foreign   tax   credit.87   Section   383   also   calls   for regulations   to   employ   Section   382   principles   to   limit   capital   loss  carryforwards   of   a   loss   company.88   In   addition,   the   regulations   must provide   that   any   permitted   use   of a capital   loss carryforward   in any   year will   reduce   the   Section   382   limitation   on   loss   carryforwards   for   that  year.89  E. OTHER LOSS   LIMITATIONS  1. ACQUISITIONS MADE TO EVADE TAX: SECTION 269  Code: § 269. If a corporation surmounts the hurdles of Section 382, it still may find its losses limited by Section 269. The subjective approach of Section  269 is fundamentally different from the   objective tests   of Section 382.  Section   269   applies to a transaction   only if the   principal purpose of  the  acquisition   was   “evasion or avoidance of Federal   income tax by  acquiring  the benefit   of a deduction, credit, or other   allowance”   which the taxpayer otherwise   might not   enjoy.   Section   269(a)   potentially   applies to Type   A  8   .R.C.   § 383(a)(2)(A). 86   .R.C.   § 383(a)(2)(B). 87   T.R.C.   § 383(c). SES   AOS   GIR) LR.C.   § 383(b).

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES  and C reorganizations and   forward triangular mergers and to Type B  reorganizations or stock purchases where the acquiring   corporation previously owned less than 50 percent of the target.9° Section 269(b) applies to liquidations which occur within   two years after a corporation  makes a stock purchase   which   would have qualified for a Section 338 election but   only if no such election was made.®?!  If Section   269   applies,   the   Commissioner   has   the   power   to deny   any  “deduction,   credit   or   allowance.”   In   theory,   Section   269   thus   has   a  potentially   broader   reach   than   Section   382.   Although   Congress   has indicated   that   Section   269   should   not   be   applied   to a transaction   where carryovers   were   limited   by   the   prior   versions   of   Section   382,92   the  proposed   regulations   make   it clear   that   current   Sections   382   and   383   do  not   limit   the   Service’s   ability   to   invoke   Section   269.93   Thus,   if a   tax  avoidance   device   or   scheme   is detected,   Section   269   can   deny   even   those  NOLs   that   otherwise   slip   by   the   limits   of Section   382.   It is expected, however,   that   Section   269   will   be   applied   more   sparingly   now   that   the  objective   limits   on   loss carryovers   have   been   strengthened.  2.   LIMITATIONS   ON   USE   OF   PREACQUISITION   LOSSES   TO  OFFSET   BUILT-IN   GAINS:   SECTION   384  Code:   § 384.  Section   384   restricts   an   acquiring   corporation   from   using   its  preacquisition   losses   to offset   built-in   gains   of an   acquired   corporation. The   policy   and   operation   of Section   384   can   best   be   illustrated   by   an  example.   Assume   that   Loss   Corporation   (“L”)   has   $100,000   of   net  operating   loss   carryforwards.   At   the   beginning   of   the   current   year, profitable   Target   Corporation   (“T”)   merges   into   L in a   tax-free   Type   A reorganization.   L and   T are   owned   by unrelated   individual   shareholders, and   the   merger   does   not   result   in a Section   382   ownership   change   to L. T’s   only   asset,   Gainacre,   has   a value   of $200,000   and   an   adjusted   basis  of $125,000   which   will transfer   to L under   Section   362(b).   Assume   that   L  sells   Gainacre   for $200,000   shortly   after   the   merger,   realizing   a $75,000 gain.  Unless Section   269 or Section   382   applied, L could apply its  preacquisition losses to shelter any   gains  recognized on  the  disposition of the   assets acquired   from T. Thus, L could   use its net operating loss  carryforwards to  offset the $75,000   gain on   the   sale  of Gainacre.   Because  it was not   clear   that   Section   269 would effectively   deter this strategy,  90   T.R.C.   § 269(a)(2).  91   See   Chapter   8C2,   supra. 92 See, e.g., S.Rep.   No.   94-938,   94th   Cong.,   2d Sess. 206 (1976), reprinted in 1976-3 C.B.  (Part   1)  244;   S.Rep.   No.   1622,   83d   Cong.,   2d  Sess.   284   (1954).  93 Reg. §  1.269~7   provides   that   Section   269   may be applied to disallow a deduction,   credit or other   allowance   when the item is limited or reduced   under   Section   382 or   383. The fact  that  an   item is limited   under   Section   382(a) or 383 is relevant   to  the   determination   of  whether   the  principal   purpose   of the acquisition   is  evasion   or avoidance   of federal   tax.  589

590   TAXATION   OF   C   CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Congress   became   concerned   that loss corporations   would   become   vehicles for “laundering”   the built-in   gains   of profitable   target   companies.   Section 384—yet   another   attack   on   the   real   and   perceived   abuses   flowing   from  corporate   acquisitions—is   the   legislative   response.   Its   purpose   is   to   — preclude   a   corporation   from   using   its   preacquisition   losses   to   shelter  built-in   gains   of   another   (usually,   a   target)   corporation   which   are  recognized   within   five   years   of an   acquisition   of the   gain   corporation’s  assets   or   stock.   In the   example   above,   L would   be prevented   from   using  its preacquisition   net   operating   loss   as   a deduction   against   the   $75,000 “recognized   built-in   gain” on   the   disposition   of Gainacre.  Section   384   is   triggered   in   two   situations:   (1)   stock   acquisitions, where   one   corporation   acquires   “control”   (defined   by reference   to the   80- percent-of-vote-and-value   benchmark   in   Section   1504(a)(2))   of another corporation,   and   (2) asset   acquisitions   in an   acquisitive   Type   A,   C or   D  reorganization,   if   either   corporation   is   a   “gain   corporation”—i.e.,   a  corporation   having   built-in   gains.%4   As   originally   enacted,   Section   384 applied   only when a loss corporation   acquired   the stock   or assets   of a gain corporation,   but   Congress   later   expanded   the   provision   to   apply  regardless   of which   corporation   acquired   the other.   If applicable,   Section 384(a)   provides   that   the   corporation’s   income,   to the   extent   attributable  to “recognized   built-in   gains,”   shall   not   be   offset   by any   “preacquisition  loss”   other   than   a   preacquisition   loss   of   the   gain   corporation.   This punishment   occurs   during   any   “recognition   period   taxable   year,”   which  is   any   taxable   year   within   the   five-year   period   beginning   on   the  “acquisition   date.”95  Understanding the operation of Section   384 requires a mastery of its glossary, much of which is borrowed from Section 382. The essential terms are as follows: (1) The “acquisition   date” is the   date on which control is  acquired, in the   case   of a stock   acquisition, or the   date of the transfer, in the   case   of an   asset acquisition.  (2) A “preacquisition loss” is any net operating loss  carryforward to the taxable   year in which the   acquisition date   occurs and the  portion of any net operating loss  for the  Sess.   421 (1988).

CHAPTER   12   CARRYOVERS   OF   CORPORATE   TAX ATTRIBUTES   591  (3)  (4)  taxable year of the acquisition to the extent the loss is allocable to the period before the acquisition date.97 A   “recognized   built-in   gain”   is any   gain   recognized   on   the  disposition   of   any   asset   during   the   five-year   recognition period   except   to the extent   that   the   gain corporation   (in the case   of   an   acquisition   of   control)   or   the   ~acquiring corporation   (in the   case   of an   asset   acquisition)   establishes  that   the   asset   was   not   held   by the   gain   corporation   on   the acquisition   date,   or   that   the   gain   accrued   after   the  acquisition   date.98   Income   items   recognized   after   the  acquisition   date   but   attributable   to   prior   periods   are   also  treated   as   recognized   built-in   gain.99 This   definition   should  be   familiar;   it is similar   to the   definition   of the   same   term  in   Section   382(h)(2)(A)   except   that   the   burden   of proof   is different.   Under   Section   382,   the burden   is on   the taxpayer  to   establish   that   the   asset   was   held   by   the   old   loss  corporation   before   the   change   date   and   the recognized   gain  does   not   exceed   the   appreciation   in the   asset   on   that   date.  Under   Section   384,   it is presumed   that   a   gain   recognized during   the   recognition   period   is a built-in   gain   unless   the  corporation   establishes   that   the   asset   was   not   held   on   the acquisition   date   or   that   the   recognized   gain   exceeds   the  built-in   gain   at the   time   of the   acquisition. The   amount   of recognized   built-in   gain for any   taxable   year is limited   to the   “net   unrealized   built-in   gain”   reduced   by  recognized   built-in   gains   for prior   years   in the   recognition  period   which,   but for Section   384, would   have   been   offset by  preacquisition   losses.19   For   this   purpose,   the   definition   of  “net   unrealized   built-in   gain”   is   borrowed   from   Section 382(h)(3),   substituting   the   acquisition   date   for   the  ownership   “change   date.”101   Thus,   it is the   excess   of the  aggregate   fair   market   value   of   the   assets   of   the   “gain  corporation”   over   the   aggregate   adjusted   bases   of   those  assets,   except   that   the   net   unrealized   built-in   gain   will be  deemed   to be   zero   unless   it is greater   than   the   lesser   of (1)  15   percent   of the   fair   market   value   of the   corporation’s assets   other   than   cash   and   certain   marketable   securities   or  (2) $10   million.10  97 T.R.C. § 384(c)(3)(A).   In the   case   of a corporation   with a net unrealized built-in  loss, as defined by Section   382(h)(1)(B),   the term   “preacquisition loss”   also includes   any built-in   loss recognized   during the  five-year   recognition   period.

592  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  The   limitations   in Section   384(a)   do not   apply   to the   preacquisition loss of any   corporation   that was   a member   of the same   “controlled   group” that included   the gain corporation   at all times   during   the five-year period ending   on   the   acquisition   date.   For   this   purpose,   the   definition   of |  controlled   group   is borrowed   from   Section   1563   (as modified   to generally require   more   than   50   percent   common   ownership   of both   voting   power and   value).193  As   if the   foregoing   rules   were   not   enough,   Section   384(f)   authorizes  the Treasury   to promulgate   regulations   as   may   be necessary   to carry   out the   anti-abuse   mission   of the   section.14  PROBLEM  Gain   Corp.,   which   is wholly   owned   by individual   A,   has   the   following  assets   and   no   liabilities:  Asset   Adj.

Unless   otherwise indicated   below, assume that Loss   Corp. acquired all  the   assets of Gain Corp. in a tax-free Type A reorganization on J anuary l,  Year 1. After the   acquisition, B owned   80% and A owned   20% of the Loss Corp. stock. To what extent, if any, may Loss   Corp. use its preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards against the gains recognized in the following alternative   transactions?:  (a) Loss   Corp. sells Gainacre for $500,000 in Year 2. (b) Same as (a), above,   except that Loss   Corp. acquired all of Gain  Corp.’s   stock from A for cash (not making a § 338 election)   on January 1, Year 1, after which it liquidated Gain Corp. under  § 332.  (c) Same as (a), above,   except   Loss   Corp. also sells the inventory  for $400,000 in Year 2.  (d) Instead of (a)-(c), above,   Loss   Corp. sells Gainacre for  $900,000 in Year 7.  (e) Same as (a), above,   except  that  Loss   Corp.   has no  net operating  loss carryforwards at the   time of the   acquisition   but its only  asset is Lossacre, which   had a fair market value of $300,000 and an adjusted   basis   of $500,000.

CHAPTER 12 CARRYOVERS OF CORPORATE TAX ATTRIBUTES 593  Lossacre for $200,000 at the same time that it sells Gainacre  for $500,000.  3.   CONSOLIDATED   RETURN   RULES  C   corporations   generally   determine   their   taxable   income   and   tax  liability   without   regard   to   the   income   and   losses   of   other   affiliated  entities.   The   consolidated   return   rules   are   an   exception   to this   separate  entity   principle.   Section   1501   permits   an   “affiliated   group   of  corporations”   to   elect   to   file   a   consolidated   tax   return   in   which   their  separate   taxable   income   and   losses   are   aggregated.1°5   An   “affiliated  group”   is defined   as   a   chain   of corporations   linked   by   specific   levels   of  stock   ownership.   The   common   parent   of the   group   must   own   at least   80  percent   of the   total   voting   power   and   value   of at least   one   corporation   in  the   chain,   and   every   corporation   in the   chain   must   be   80 percent   owned (based   on   voting   power   and   value)   by other   members   of the   group.19  When   computing   the   consolidated   taxable   income   or   loss   of   an  affiliated   group   of   corporations,   each   member   of   the   group   first  determines   its separate   taxable   income   or   loss.1°7   The   separate   taxable  income   or   loss   figures   of the   members   of the   group   are   then   combined,  and   the   Section   11 tax   rates   are   applied   to the   aggregate   figure   to arrive  at the   group’s   tax   liability.  Because   the   consolidated   return   rules   permit   aggregation   of the  separate   taxable   income   and   loss   of the   members,   the   potential   exists   for  one   member   of the   group   to offset   its taxable   income   with   the   losses   of another   member.   For   example,   without   a specific   limitation,   a profitable  corporation   could   acquire   the requisite   ownership   of a corporation   with   a  large   net   operating   loss,   the   two   corporations   could   elect   to   file   a  consolidated   return,   and   the   joint   tax   liability   of the   corporate   family  would   be reduced   as   the net operating   losses   of one   member   are   deducted  against   the income   of the   other.   A multi-layer   of statutes   and   regulations limit   the   use   of net   operating   losses   by corporations   filing a consolidated return.   First,   all of the   statutory   limitations   on   the   use   of NOLs   studied  earlier   in this   chapter   (i.e.,   Sections   382,   383,   384   and   269)   potentially  apply   to   a   consolidated   group.'§   If any   loss   somehow   should   survive  these   statutory   gatekeepers,   the   consolidated   return   regulations   contain  an   additional   rule   to patrol   abuse:   the   “separate   return   limitation   year”  (“SRLY’)   limitation.1°9   The   operation   of these   rules   should   be   familar  105 See   generally Chapter 1D2,   supra, and   Chapter 13, infra.  106 [.R.C. § 1504(a)(1), (2). In   general,   preferred stock is not counted for purposes of the ownership tests and certain   corporations subject to special tax  regimes, such as tax-exempt   and foreign   corporations, are   not permitted to be part of  an   affiliated group.   LR.C. § 1504(a)(4), (b).  107 Reg.   §§ 1.1502—2,   1.1502-11(a)(1),   1.1502-12.  108 See   Reg. §  1.1502-90   through   Reg. § 1.1502-99,   which   apply   Section   382 to   a consolidated   group of  corporations. .  109 The   regulations   also   include   limitations   on   the   use   of built-in   losses and capital   loss  carryovers   and   carrybacks.   See   Reg.   §§ 1.1502-15;   1,1502—22(c), (d). These   items   are   also  subject   to  the   SRLY   limitation. -

594  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  because they reflect many of the same policies embodied in the generally  applicable   statutory limitations.  The   SRLY   limitation   is designed   to prevent   the   use   by an   affiliated  group   of net   operating   losses   arising   in a separate   return   limitation   year   .  of   a member   of the   group.   A separate   return   limitation   year   is a taxable year   in which   the member   filed either its own   separate   tax return   or filed  as   part   of   another   affiliated   group.14°   In   general,   the   aggregate   net operating   losses   of   a member   of an   affiliated   group   arising   in   separate return   years   only   may   be   carried   over   and   used   to offset   the   aggregate  consolidated   income   attributable   to that   member.14   Thus,   if a profitable  corporation   (“P”)   acquires   a   target   corporation   (“T”)   with   large   net operating   losses,   and   the   two   corporations   file a consolidated   tax   return, preacquisition   losses   and   built-in   losses   of   T may   not   be   used   to reduce  the   postacquisition   tax   liability   on   consolidated   taxable   income  attributable   to P. The   regulations   include   an   important   exception   that   restricts   the application   of the   SRLY   limitation.   Generally,   the   SRLY   limitation   does  not   apply   in   any   case   where   a   corporation   becomes   a   member   of   a  consolidated   group   (where   the   limitation   otherwise   would   apply)   within  six months   of the change   date   of a Section   382(g)   change   of ownership.   112 As   a   result,   in   many   acquisitions   the   SRLY   limitation   relinquishes  jurisdiction   over   NOLs   to Section   382.113  ee 1 ee  110 Reg. § 1.1502-1(e), (f).  111 Reg.  § 1.1502-21(c).  m2 Reg. § 1.1502-21(g)(1) & (2).  113 A similar   rules   applies   in  the case   of  recognized   built-in   losses.

CHAPTER   13  AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS  A.   RESTRICTIONS   ON   AFFILIATED   CORPORATIONS  1.   INTRODUCTION  For   a   variety   of   reasons,   business   owners   often   conduct   their  activities   through   multiple   corporations.   For   example,   to protect   a low- risk   existing   business   from   potential   tort   liability,   the   shareholders   of a closely   held   corporation   might   form   a separate   corporation   to conduct   a new,   high-risk   activity.   Similarly,   a holding   company   with   an   operating  subsidiary   might   determine   that   the   regulatory   requirements   of   a  particular   state   or   country   are   sufficiently   stringent   that   a   planned  expansion   into   that   jurisdiction   should   take   place   through   a   new  subsidiary.   Should   these   business   decisions   about   the   corporate  structure   affect   the   manner   in which   the   enterprises   are   treated   for tax  purposes?  A   corporation,   like   an   individual,   generally   is treated   as   a separate  taxable   entity.   If this   rule   were   unqualified,   however,   business   owners  might   have   an   incentive   to create   separate   corporations   solely   to obtain  tax   benefits.   Recognizing   this   incentive,   the   Code   treats   related  corporations   for many   purposes   as a single economic   unit.   There   may   also  be   an   incentive   for   related   corporations   to   reduce   their   tax   liability through   transactions   where   they   deal   with   each   other   on   terms   which unrelated   parties   operating   at   arm’s   length   would   not   agree.   Congress again   recognized   this   incentive   and   provided   tax   administrators   with   a powerful   weapon   to counteract   it. This   section   of the chapter   explores   the  Code’s   rules   to   address   these   and   other   concerns   about   the   taxation   of  affiliated   corporations. 2. LIMITATIONS   ON ACCUMULATED EARNINGS   CREDIT  Code: § 1561(a). Skim §§ 535(c); 1563.  Section   1561.   Historically,   the   basic purpose of Section   1561   has been to prevent   business   owners   from   obtaining   multiple tax  benefits by  subdividing the business among multiple   corporations. The   Tax   Cuts   and Jobs Act, however, significantly reduced the reach of Section   1561.   Prior to the 2017 Act, a corporation’s   taxable   income   was   subject to tax under  Section   11   at graduated rates ranging   from 15 to 35   percent.  Corporations also were   subject to the   alternative minimum tax, which contained a $40,000   “exemption   amount” that   sheltered   that amount of covered   income   from   the   tax. These   benefits   provided   an   incentive to  fragment a business   into   multiple   corporations   in  order   to  increase   the  amount   of total   income   taxed   at  the   lower   Section   11   rates   and   obtain  595

--- Page 666 ---

596  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  multiple   AMT   exemptions.   Section   1561   deterred   those   strategies   by  providing   that   tax   benefits   received   by   certain   related   groups   of  corporations   could   not   exceed   what   the   group   would   receive   if it were   a  single   corporation.  The   2017   Act’s   replacement   of graduated   rates   in Section   11 with   a flat   21   percent   corporate   tax   rate   and   the   Act’s   repeal   of the   corporate AMT   significantly   reduced   the   potential   tax   savings   from   forming multiple   corporations.   Congress,   in   turn,   reduced   the   reach   of Section 1561,   which   now   targets   only the “accumulated   earnings   credit”   provided by   Section   535(c).1   The   component   members   of   a   controlled   group   of corporations   are   limited   to   one   accumulated   earnings   credit   and   the credit   generally   is divided   equally   among   the   members   of the   group.?  Section   1561,   however,   retains   its place   in the   Code,   and   if progressive  corporate   tax   rates   return   there   is little   doubt   that   the   Code   will   be  amended   to   guard   against   abuse   of the   lower   tax   rates   via   multiple  corporations.  Component   Members of a Controlled Group of  Corporations. Section  1561   applies only to the “component members of a controlled group of corporations.” The terms “component members” and “controlled group of corporations” are defined in Section 1563. Although simple in concept,  these terms are defined in the Code   and regulations   with an  extraordinary degree of complexity   and specificity. Only a brief overview  of those rules is provided here. Section 1563   generally defines   three   principal   types of controlled  groups of corporations: a parent-subsidiary controlled   group, a brother- sister controlled   group, and a combined group.? A parent-subsidiary  controlled group   generally is defined as one or more chains of corporations connected   through stock ownership to a common parent, if (1) stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power  or total value of all classes of stock of each   corporation (other than the parent) is owned   by one or more of the   other   corporations, and (2) the parent owns stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined  voting power or total value of all classes of stock of  at least one of the  other   corporations.4 Thus, if corporation X   owns 80 percent of the total  combined voting power of corporations Y and Z, then   X, Y and   Z are  members of a parent-subsidiary controlled   group.® The definition   of a  brother-sister   controlled group is two or more   corporations where five or  fewer   shareholders who are individuals,   estates, or trusts own stock  possessing   more   than 50 percent of  the total combined voting power or  1 The   accumulated earnings credit reduces the  tax  lability of corporations   subject to the  special   tax  on accumulated earnings   im osed by Section 531.

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS 597  more than 50 percent of the total value of each corporation, taking into  account the   stock ownership of each   person only to the extent such ownership is identical with respect to each   such corporation.®   For example, assume shareholder A owns 25 percent of X Corporation’s common stock and 35 percent of Y Corporation’s common stock. Assume further that shareholder B owns 30 percent of X’s common stock and 40  percent of  Y’s common stock. A’s and B’s identical ownership in X and Y  is 25 percent and 30   percent,   respectively.   Since A’s and B’s identical  ownership of common stock totals more than 50 percent of each corporation, X and Y are members of a brother-sister controlled   group. A  combined group is   a group of three or more corporations, if (1) each  corporation is a member of either a parent-subsidiary controlled group or a brother-sister controlled   group, and (2)  at least one of the corporations is the common parent of a parent-subsidiary controlled group and also is a member of a brother-sister   controlled   group.? For example, if an individual owns 80 percent of the total combined voting power of corporations X and Y, and Y owns 80 percent of the total combined voting  power of corporation Z, then X, Y and   Z are members of a combined  group.8 Several special   rules apply in determining   whether a controlled  group of corporations exists, including limitations on what constitutes  “stock” and an elaborate set of attribution rules similar to those under Section 318.9  A   corporation   generally   qualifies   as   a   “component   member”   of   a  controlled   group   of corporations   for   a taxable   year   if it is   a member   on the   December   31   that   falls within   that   taxable   year.1°   If a corporation   is  not   a member   on   December   31, it still can   be treated   as   a member   for its  taxable   year   if it was   a member   at some   point   during   the   calendar   year and   was   a member   for at least   one-half   of the   number   of days   during   its taxable   year   that preceded   December   31.1! Certain   corporations,   referred  to as “excluded   corporations,”   cannot   be component   members.   Among   the excluded   corporations   are   certain   corporations   that   are   exempt   from   tax  under   Section   501(a)   and   foreign   corporations   that   are   not   engaged   in a  trade   or   business   in   the   United   States.12   In   some   cases,   a   corporation  may   qualify   as   a component   member   of more   than   one   controlled   group.  Section   1563(b)(4)   makes   clear that   a corporation   in this situation   can   be  a member   of only one   controlled   group,   and   the regulations   provide   rules for determining   to which   group   it belongs.'8 Broader Significance   of a Controlled Group of Corporations.

598   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  1563(a)’s   definition   of   a   “controlled   group   of   corporations.”!4   The definition   thus   has   significance   that   extends   beyond   dividing   up just the accumulated   earnings   credit.   Some   of these   provisions   are   similar   to Section   1561   in that   they   limit   the   aggregate   amount   of a   specific   tax benefit   available   to   a   controlled   group   of corporations.   For   example,   a controlled   group   is   limited   to   one   $25,000   amount   for   purposes   of  computing   the   general   business   credit   limitation   under   Section   38.45  Similarly,   the   component   members   of a controlled   group   are   treated   as  one   taxpayer   for purposes   of deducting   the cost of Section   179   property.16 In other   cases,   provisions   of the   Code   use   Section   1563(a)’s   definition   for a slightly different   purpose   and   with   a different   ownership   threshold.   For example,   Section   267   provides   that,   in the   case   of property   transferred from   one   member   of a   controlled   group   to   another   member,   any   loss realized   on   the   transfer   cannot   be   recognized   until   the   property   is  transferred   outside   the   controlled   group.17   For   this   purpose,   Section  1563(a)   1s applied   with   a “more   than   50 percent”   rather   than   an   “at least 80 percent”   ownership   threshold.18  3.   SECTION   482  Code:   § 482.  Regulations:   § 1.482—1(a),   (b), (c)(1).  a.   INTRODUCTION  If a novice in the field of taxation were   asked to peruse the Code   and  select several provisions that he or she thought were of most significance, Section   482 might   seem an unlikely   candidate. Weighing in at just under  200   words, it could easily be perceived as innocuous. Nothing could   be  further from the truth. The sparse and opaque   language of Section   482 is the statutory tip   of a large and complex iceberg on which many a  taxpayer has   run aground. Section   482   represents a broad   Congressional grant of power to the Service to reallocate income,   deductions   and other tax items among  certain commonly controlled taxpayers when the   reallocation is  necessary to prevent   evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect income.  Although originally designed to apply  principally in the domestic context Section   482 is of most significance today in international   transactions, such as sales   of goods by a foreign parent to its U.S. subsidiary or wick versa, and to the   use   of intangible   property. As one might expect of such  a broad grant of authority,   Section   482   has become one   of  the   Service’s  principal weapons in its fight against   devices   used   by  taxpayers to reduce  14 Section   1563   has a modified definition   of a brother-si  generally   applies to other Code provisions.

STATUTORY   ELEMENTS  Section   482   permits   the   Service   to reallocate   tax   items   when   three  basic   elements   are   present:   (1)   there   are   two   or   more   organizations,  trades   or   businesses,   (2)   that   are   owned   or   controlled   by   the   same  interests,   and   (3) the reallocation   is necessary   to prevent   evasion   of taxes  or   clearly   to   reflect   the   income   of any   of the   organizations,   trades   or  businesses.  Much   of the   power   conferred   by Section   482   derives   from   the   broad meanings   of the terms   “organization”   and   “trade   or business.”!9   This   first  element   is satisfied   regardless   of whether   the   taxpayers   in question   are  incorporated,   are   domestic   or   foreign,   or   are   affiliated.2°   Sole  proprietorships,   partnerships,   trusts   and estates   (as well as corporations) all   are   subject   to   Section   482.21   In   several   contexts,   taxpayers   have  challenged   Section   482   adjustments   on   the   ground   that   the   transaction  in   question   did   not   involve   two   or   more   organizations,   trades   or businesses.22   In   the   typical   case,   however,   there   is   little   dispute  concerning   this   first   element.   When   the   Service   proposes   to   reallocate  income   to   a   U.S.   subsidiary   from   its   foreign   parent,   for   example,   it generally   is clear   that   two   or more   business   entities   are   involved.  The   second   element   similarly   has   received   an _ expansive interpretation   and   typically   is not   the   subject   of most   current   disputes  under   Section   482   between   taxpayers   and   the   Service.   According   to the  statute,   ownership   or   control   can   be   direct   or   indirect.   The   regulations elaborate   on   this   by   providing   that   “controlled”   means   any   kind   of  control,   whether   or not   legally   enforceable,   and   that   “[i]t is the reality   of  the   control   that   is decisive,   not   its   form   or   the   mode   of its   exercise.”28  Control   thus   might   exist   as   a result   of   a common   interest   between   two  otherwise   unrelated   taxpayers.   For   example   in   B.   Forman   Co.   v.  Commissioner,24   two   unrelated   corporations   operating   competing department   stores   formed   a new   corporation   to construct   and   operate   an enclosed   shopping   mall   and   office   complex,   with   each   shareholder  19 Prior to 1934,   the predecessor of Section   482 referred   only to trades or businesses. In  that year, Congress   added the reference to organizations “to remove any   doubt as   to the application of  this section to   all kinds of business activity.” H.R.   Rep.

600  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  receiving 50 percent of the new corporation’s stock and equal  representation on its board. Finding that   the common control requirement was satisfied, the   court upheld the   Service’s authority to impose an arm’s   length interest rate   on interest-free loans   that   the  shareholders made to the new corporation.  The   third   element   generally   is “where   the   action   is” in Section   482  disputes.   Because   Section   482   itself   provides   no   standard   regarding  when   it is necessary   to make   allocations   to prevent   tax evasion   or clearly  to reflect   income,   the   extensive   interpretive   regulations,   administrative  rulings,   and judicial   decisions   are   the   main   sources   of guidance.  c.   ALLOCATION   STANDARD   AND   METHODS  The   standard   that   the   Service   applies   in   examining   transactions between   commonly   controlled   taxpayers   is that of uncontrolled   taxpayers dealing   with   each   other   at arm’s   length.25   That   is, the   Service   compares  the results   of a transaction   between   commonly   controlled   taxpayers   with those   of   a   comparable   transaction   under   comparable   circumstances between   uncontrolled   taxpayers.?6   If the   results   of the   two   transactions are   consistent,   then   the controlled   transaction   satisfies   the   arm’s   length standard. For example,   suppose that FP, a French manufacturer of perfume, distributes its finished products in the United States by selling them for resale to two U.S. corporations: Company A, a wholly owned subsidiary  of FP, and Company B, a corporation not under common ownership or control with either FP or Company A. If the products that FP sells   to  Companies   A and B are identical and the transactions between   FP and Company   A and FP and Company B are the same in all material respects  (e.g., volume of sales and point of  delivery), then the Service likely would determine whether the FP-Company A transactions satisfy the arm’s length standard   by  comparing   them with FP-Company B transactions. Thus, if FP sells the same product to Company A for $45 per bottle and  to Company B for $20 per bottle, then, absent some factor   that accounts  for  this difference,   the   Service likely would reallocate income   from FP to  Company   A to ensure that   the taxpayers do not   use pricing to keep artificially low the income   earned   by the FP-Company   A group that is  subject to U.S. tax. The reallocation would be from FP to Company   A  because, by raising   the   price charged to Company A, FP effectively allocates a larger   portion of income to its own taxing jurisdiction. That  1s, if Companies   A and B both sell the same bottle   of perfume in the U.S.  for $50, Company B will realize a profit of $30 that is subject to U.S. tax.  Absent a reallocation   of income, Company A will   realize a profit   of only  $5. In  this simple   example, the  Service would reallocate   $25 of income to  eee 75 Reg.   § 1.482—1(b)(1). 6 Id.; Reg.   §  1.482-1(d)(1).

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS 601  Company A and thereby render that additional income subject to U.S.  tax.  In   determining   whether   an   “uncontrolled”   transaction   is   a  comparable   transaction   under   comparable   circumstances,   a   variety   of  factors   must   be   considered,   such   as   the   contractual   terms   of   the  controlled   and   uncontrolled   transactions   (e.g.,   volume   of   sales   or  purchases)   and   the   degree   of financial   and   other   risks   that   the   parties   in  each   transaction   assume.27   Further,   the   regulations   promulgated   under  Section   482   provide   several   methods   for determining   whether   the results  of a   controlled   transaction   are   at   arm’s   length   and,   if they   are   not,   for  determining   the   appropriate   arm’s   length   result.28   These   methods   often  are   referred   to   as   “transfer   pricing   methodologies.”   The   particular method   that   applies   will   depend   in   part   on   the   type   of transaction   at issue.   For   example,   the   methods   prescribed   for   a   transfer   of tangible property   differ   from   those   prescribed   for   a   transfer   of   intangible  property.29   In   choosing   among   the   available   methods,   the   “best   method  rule”   dictates   that   the   arm’s   length   result   of a controlled   transaction   be determined   under   the   method   that   “provides   the   most   reliable   measure  of an   arm’s   length   result.”3°  d.   COLLATERAL   ADJUSTMENTS  When   the   Service   makes   an   adjustment   under   Section   482   with  respect   to   one   commonly   controlled   taxpayer,   it also   makes   collateral  adjustments   to any   other   commonly   controlled   taxpayers   involved.3!   The  other   taxpayer   must   reflect   the   collateral   adjustment   in the   documents  that   it maintains   for U.S.   tax   purposes.®?   A collateral   adjustment   might  have   an   immediate   effect,   a deferred   effect,   or   no   effect   at all (e.g., if the  other   taxpayer   is not   subject   to U.S.   tax   and   the   collateral   adjustment  has   no   effect on intercorporate   transfers).   For example,   if the Service   uses  Section   482   to impute   interest   income   to a U.S.   parent   with   respect   to an interest-free   loan   that   the   parent   makes   to   its   foreign   subsidiary,   the  foreign   subsidiary   must   reflect   imputed   interest   payments   in the   books  that   it   maintains   for   U.S.   tax   purposes.   The   likely   effect   would   be   a  decrease   in   the   subsidiary’s   earnings   and   profits,   which   in turn   would  affect the tax treatment   of dividends   that   the subsidiary   pays   to the U.S. parent.33  eee eee ee  27 Reg. § 1.482-1(d)(1).  28 See   Reg.   §§  1.482—2   through 1.482-9. 29 Compare Reg. § 1.482—3(a)   with   Reg. § 1.482—4.  30 Reg. § 1.482-1(c)(1);   see   also  Reg. § 1.482-8. 31 Reg.   § 1.482-1(g)(1) & (2).  32 Reg.   § 1.482-1(g)(2)(ii). 33 Reg.   §  1.482-1(g)(2)(iv)   Example 3.

602  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  e.   COMMON   TRANSACTIONS  Although   the   Service   has   the   authority   to   apply   Section   482   to  virtually   any   type   of   transaction   between   commonly   controlled  taxpayers,   the   regulations   set   forth   five   categories   of transactions   that   . are   most   likely   to   trigger   adjustments.   These   are:   (1)   loans   and  advances,4   (2)   the   performance   of   services,?>   (3)   the   use   of   tangible property   (such   as   a   lease   of business   premises),?6   (4) sales   of tangible property,?7   and   (5) the   sale   or   use   of intangible   property.8   In each   case,  the regulations   provide   guidelines—with   varying   degrees   of specificity—  for determining   an   arm’s   length   result.  Transfers   of intangible   property   such   as copyrights,   trademarks   and patents   historically   have   distinguished   themselves   as   particularly difficult transactions   to analyze   under   the   arm’s   length   standard,   in part  because   of the common   lack   of comparable   uncontrolled   transactions.   To assist   the   IRS,   Congress   amended   Section   482   by   adding   a   second sentence,   commonly   referred   to   as   the   “super-royalty”   provision,   which  requires   that   the   income   derived   from a transfer   of intangible   property “be   commensurate   with   the   income   attributable   to the   intangible.”   The  provision   was   enacted   in part   as   a result   of concern   that   U.S.   taxpayers were   developing   intangible   property   in   the   U.S.—often   with   the assistance   of tax benefits   designed   to encourage   such   development—and  then   insulating   the income   generated   by the   intangible   from   U.S.   tax   by transferring   the intangible   to a foreign   affiliate   at a bargain   price.39   The super-royalty   provision   addresses   this   concern   by   directing   that   the adequacy   of the consideration   received   by the transferor   of an   intangible  (whether   received   in   a   lump   sum   or   periodically)   be   determined   by  comparing   the consideration   with   the income   derived   from   the intangible  by the transferee.4°   The   “commensurate   with income”   standard   generally  must   be   satisfied   not   only   in   the   year   when   the   intangible   is   first  transferred   but   also   in   all   subsequent   years   that   the   arrangement  between   the   controlled   taxpayers   is in effect.41   Congress   also   added   the  third   sentence   to   Section   482   in   order   to   specifically   give   the   IRS   the authority   to value   the   transfer   of intangibles,   including   transfers   with  other   property   or   services,   on   (1) an   aggregate   basis,   or   (2) the   basis   of  the   realistic   alternatives   to such   a transfer,   “if the   Secretary   determines  34 Reg. § 1.482-2(a). The application of Section   482 to loans with below-market interest rates has   been superseded to  a large   extent by Section   7872. : 35 Reg. § 1.482-2(b); see Reg. § 1.482-9. 36 Reg. § 1.482-2(c). 87   Reg.   § 1.482-3.  38   Reg.   § 1.4824. 39 H.R.

If the  transferor   receives   consideration in a lump sum,   the lump  sum is treated as an advance   payment of a stream of  royalties   payable   over   the   shorter   of  the  vee life of the  intangible   and   the  duration   of  the agreement   between the  parties.

OTHER   ISSUES  Advance   Pricing   Agreements.   Disputes   regarding   the   proper application   of Section   482   to   a   transaction   can   be   extraordinarily   time  consuming   and   expensive   for   everyone   involved,   particularly   if   the  dispute   leads   to   litigation.4?   In   an   effort   to   avoid   such   disputes,   the Service   has   implemented   a procedure   under   which   taxpayers   can   secure an   “advance   pricing   agreement”   with   the   Service   on   how   Section   482   will  apply   to one   or   more   transactions   between   a taxpayer   and   other   parties  under   common   control.44   The   taxpayer   initiates   the process   by proposing  transfer   pricing   methodologies   and   data   to   show   that   the   suggested  methodologies   are   the   best   method   for determining   arm’s   length   results between   the   taxpayer   and   specified   affiliates.   The   Service   evaluates   the taxpayer’s   request   and   if, after   discussion,   the proposal   is acceptable,   the parties   execute   an   advance   pricing   agreement   covering   the   proposed  methodologies.   A   requested   advance   pricing   agreement   may   also   be bilateral   or   multilateral,   if it involves   pricing   in both   the   United   States and   one   or   more   countries   having   a tax   treaty   with   the   United   States.45 Although   seeking   an   advance   pricing   agreement   is by no   means   a small undertaking,   the   process   can   be   significantly   less   burdensome   than   the  alternative   of an   audit,   administrative   appeals,   and   litigation.  Penalties and Reporting   Requirements. One difficulty for the Treasury in administering Section   482 is its lack of  access to taxpayer  information.   To assist the government,   Congress has strengthened the  applicable   penalty   and reporting requirements that apply to taxpayers.  In   general, a taxpayer faces a 20 percent (and,   in some cases, 40  percent)   penalty if either (1) the taxpayer files   a return that overstates  or understates the   price paid for property or services by more   than a  specified percentage of   the amount determined to be correct under  Section 482,46 or  (2) the   Service makes Section   482 allocations   that  result in a net increase in   the taxpayer’s   taxable income that exceeds a  threshold   amount.47   Taxpayers can   avoid   the penalty in   the second  42 Staffof  Joint Comm. on Taxation,   115th   Cong. 1st  Sess., General   Explanation of Public  ‘Law   115-97, at 388 (2018).  43 See, e.g., Ciba-Geigy Corp. v.

A taxpayer desirous of more  certainty that penalties will not apply might consider seeking an advance  pricing agreement.  As   a   result   of   the   same   concerns   that   prompted   the   penalty provisions   discussed   above,   certain   taxpayers   are   required   to   report   to the   government   (and   maintain   adequate   records   with   respect   to) transactions   with   related   parties.   Generally,   both   U.S.   corporations   that are   25 percent   foreign-owned   and   foreign   corporations   engaged   in a trade or   business   in   the   U.S.   are   subject   to   this   requirement.49   Failure   to comply   can   result   in substantial   penalties.5°  Proposed Changes to Section 482. Despite Section 482’s broad grant of power to the Executive   Branch, some tax policymakers   have   expressed  the belief that   certain taxpayers,   particularly foreign-owned  corporations, continue to use transactions   with related   parties to   shift  large amounts of income from the   U.S. to foreign jurisdictions.5! A 1992 proposal>? would   have amended Section   482 by requiring certain   foreign corporations   doing   business in the   U.S. and foreign-owned U.S.  corporations to recognize a minimum amount of U.S. taxable income if they  have   more   than a threshold level  of transactions   with foreign related parties. In   general,   the minimum U.S. taxable income for an   affected corporation   was a percentage of the corporation’s gross   receipts. The percentage   was to be established by reference to data   derived from 40 percent gross valuation misstatement penalty if the   net increase in taxable income exceeds  the lesser   of $20 million or 20 percent of gross   receipts.

In comparison with   Section 6038A, Section 6038C authorizes the Treasury Department to require   corporations subject to the   statute to maintain  ‘ aed range of records and to report a broader   range of information.

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS 605  domestic corporations in the same industry. Thus, the proposed  legislation was   designed to ensure that foreign and foreign-owned corporations report a level of income commensurate with that reported by a similarly-situated   purely domestic corporation.   This proposal  received harsh criticism on a number of grounds,   including the soundness  of its assumption that foreign-owned corporations with incomes below  the industry   average are shifting income and the possibility that   the  proposal violates provisions of tax   treaties to which the U.S. is  a party.53  Another   possible   approach   would   be   the   use   of   “formulary  apportionment,”   where   income   from   an   enterprise   is apportioned   among jurisdictions   using   a   weighting   of factors   such   as   the   taxpayer’s   sales, assets,   and   payroll.   Because   the approach   uses   these   factors   to determine the   taxpayer’s   tax   liability   in   the   various   jurisdictions   in   which   it conducts   business   rather   than   pricing   individual   transactions,   it is said to   be   simpler   and   less   susceptible   to   taxpayer   manipulation.54   Since Congress   is constantly   searching   for new   revenue,   it is quite possible   that alternatives   to the   Section   482   transfer   pricing   regime   will be considered in the future.

INTRODUCTION  Earlier in   this chapter,   we   saw that   the Code limits certain tax  benefits   available to affiliated corporations by treating the corporations,  for purposes of determining their entitlement to the  benefits, as a single taxpayer.®5 In this   section, we   explore a related   concept:   certain closely  affiliated corporations are permitted to calculate and report their federal  tax liability as   if they  were a single taxpaying unit.  As a general rule, every   corporation subject to the  federal income tax  must report its tax liability on a separate return.56   Section   1501 is an  exception to this   rule. Section   1501 permits an affiliated group of  corporations to elect to report its tax liability on a single, consolidated return. The Code,   however,   provides little guidance on   the manner in which an affiliated group must   prepare a consolidated return. Congress has   delegated that   task to the Secretary of  the Treasury, who is directed  _by  Section   1502 to issue  regulations.   Rising to the occasion,   the Treasury  53 The   proposal   was   described as being   “strongly opposed   by the Treasury and, for that matter, by virtually everyone else.” Bittker & Eustice,   Federal   Income   Taxation of Corporations  and   Shareholders   § 13.20[4] [3]. .  54 See   Fleming,   Peroni & Shay,   “Formulary   Apportionment in the US.

606 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Department has   issued extensive,   detailed regulations that are the  primary source of guidance on consolidated returns.  In reading   the material   that follows,   consider   the extent   to which the consolidated   return   rules   truly   treat   an   affiliated   group   of corporations   | as a single entity.   As you   will discover,   certain   rules   fully reflect   a single  entity model.   Others   continue   to recognize   the separate   existence   of   each  corporation   in the   group   (a “separate   entity”   model).   This   conflict   in   the regulations   is the   source   of much   of their   complexity.  2.   ELIGIBILITY   AND   ELECTION   TO   FILE   A CONSOLIDATED  RETURN  a.   ELIGIBILITY  Section   1501   grants   the privilege   of filing a consolidated   return   only to   an   “affiliated   group   of corporations.”   The   term   “affiliated   group”   is  defined   in   Section   1504(a)   as   one   or   more   chains   of   “includible corporations”   connected   through   stock   ownership   to   a   common   parent  that   is an   includible   corporation,   if (1) the   common   parent   owns   directly  stock   possessing   at least   80   percent   of the   total   voting   power   and   total  value   of the stock   of at least one   of the other   includible   corporations,   and (2) stock   possessing   at least   80 percent   of the total voting power   and   total  value   of the   stock   of each   includible   corporation   (other   than   the   common  parent)   is   owned   directly   by   one   or   more   of   the   other   includible  corporations.   Thus,   if corporation   X owns   stock   possessing   80   percent   of  the   total   voting   power   and   total   value   of corporations   Y   and   Z, and   if X,  Y   and   Z all are   includible   corporations,   then   X, Y   and   Z are   members   of  an affiliated   group   of corporations.   The   result would   be the same   if Z were  an   80   percent-owned   subsidiary   of   Y   (ie.,   if   Z   were   a   second-tier subsidiary   of X). The   term “includible corporation” is defined in Section   1504(b) as  any corporation,   with six specific exceptions. Among the corporations  excluded   from the   definition are corporations exempt from tax under Section 501, insurance companies subject to tax under Section 801, and  all foreign   corporations.57   Historically, S  corporations by definition   could not be a member of  an   affiliated group   because   they   were not permitted  to have subsidiaries. Under current   law, however,   S   corporations may  have   both C  and S corporation   subsidiaries,   but   they are not allowed to  join   in   the filing   of a consolidated   return   with their C corporation affiliates.58  In determining   whether an   affiliated group of corporations exists,  Section  1504(a)(4)   provides   that  nonvoting,   nonconvertible stock which is  limited   and   preferred as to dividends   and   has   redemption   and   liquidation  CRC: 5 i i 1+7 ees : 5  See LR.C. fe - & meee Several   special rules modify the definition   of   includible   corporation.”  58 L.R.C. § 1504(b)(6).

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS 607  rights which do not exceed the stock’s issue price, except for a reasonable  premium, is disregarded. The features described in Section   1504(a)(4) are  those commonly associated   with   preferred stock. Merely because stock is labelled as preferred stock, however, does not mean that it is ignored in applying the  stock ownership   requirements of Section 1504(a); only stock that has   each of the features listed in Section 1504(a)(4) is ignored.   This  provision   generally is favorable to taxpayers in that it permits a corporation to raise capital by issuing stock described in Section  1504(a)(4) without making the corporation ineligible to join in the filing  of a consolidated return.59 If   a   corporation   is   included   (or   required   to   be   included)   in   a consolidated   return   filed by an   affiliated   group   and   subsequently   ceases to   be   a   member   of the   group,   the   corporation   cannot   be   included   in   a consolidated   return   filed by the   group   (or certain   related   groups)   during the   succeeding   five   years.69   This   is   an   anti-abuse   rule   intended   to  foreclose   the temporary   elimination   of   a member   from   an   affiliated   group in   order   to   improve   the   group’s   or   the   member’s   tax   results.   The  Secretary   of the   Treasury   has   authority   to waive   this   five-year   waiting period   under   conditions   that   the   Secretary   prescribes.®1  b.   ELECTION   AND   RELATED   MATTERS  Even   if two   or   more   corporations   constitute   an   affiliated   group,   the corporations   must   file separate   returns   unless   they affirmatively   elect to exercise   their privilege   of filing a consolidated   return.   An   affiliated   group exercises   this   privilege   by filing a consolidated   return   not   later   than   the  last   day   prescribed   by law   (including   extensions)   for filing   the   common parent’s   return.®2   As   one   might   expect   in such   a regime,   a consolidated  return   must   be   filed   on   the   basis   of the   common   parent’s   taxable   year,  and   each   subsidiary   in   the   group   must   adopt   the   common   parent’s  taxable   year beginning   with   the first consolidated   return   year®   for which the   subsidiary’s   income   is   includible   in   the   consolidated   return.§   In contrast,   the   method   of accounting   that   each   member   of the   group   must  59 Sections   1504(a)(5)(A) and (B) similarly address what constitutes “stock” by directing the Secretary of  the Treasury to issue regulations that treat (1) warrants, obligations   convertible into stock and other   similar   interests as stock and stock as not   stock, and (2) options to acquire or sell stock as having   been exercised. See   Reg. § 1.1504—4. 60 J.R.C. § 1504(a)(3)(A). More precisely,   the corporation   cannot   again be included   ina consolidated   return filed by the group before   the sixty-first month   beginning after the  corporation’s first taxable   year in which it ceased to be a member of  the   group. Id.  61 T[.R.C. § 1504(a)(3)(B). The   general   circumstances   under   which a waiver will be  granted  are   set  forth   in  Rev.   Proc. 2002-32,   2002-1 C.B.   959, modified   by Rev.   Proc. 2006—21,   2006-1 C.B.   1050. 62 Reg. § 1.1502—75(a)(1).  63 A  consolidated   return   year is a taxable   year for which a consolidated   return is  filed or required to  be filed.

This   requirement   presumably   is  designed   to   minimize   taxpayer   challenges   to   the   regulations.®6   In general,   a   corporation   consents   to   the   regulations   by   joining   in   the  making   of a consolidated   return.§7  The   decision   to file a consolidated   return   is a significant   one,   in part because   an   affiliated   group   that   does   so   generally   must   continue   to file  on   a consolidated   basis   for all succeeding   tax   years   unless   the   group   no  longer   remains   in   existence   or   the   Secretary   grants   permission   to  discontinue   filing   for   “good   cause.”68   In   general,   an   affiliated   group   no  longer   remains   in existence   if the   common   parent   no   longer   remains   as  the   common   parent   (e.g.,   if the   parent   sells   the   stock   of   all   of   its subsidiaries   to one   or more   third   parties).   The   Service   generally   grants permission   to   discontinue   filing   for   good   cause   only   when   there   are  certain   changes   in   the   Code   or   regulations   that   have   a   substantial adverse   effect   on   the   group’s   consolidated   tax   liability   relative   to   the aggregate   tax   liability   the   members   would   incur   if they   filed   separate  returns,   or when   certain   other   factors   demonstrate   that there   exists   good  cause   for the discontinuance.”   In short,   the decision   to file a consolidated  return   is one   with   which   an   affiliated   group   likely will have   to live for an  extended   period   of time.  3. COMPUTATION OF CONSOLIDATED   TAXABLE   INCOME  a.   OVERVIEW  An affiliated group of corporations that files (or is required to file) a  consolidated   return is referred to in the regulations as   a “consolidated group.”   A consolidated   group is subject to federal income tax   on its consolidated   taxable   income.72 |  ; The first  step in determining a group’s consolidated   taxable income  1s to determine the separate   taxable income (or  loss)   of each member.73  65 Reg. § 1.1502-17(a),  86 Not all taxpayers are so easi i i   i  States, 602 F.2d  256 (Ct.C1.1979) (aieecah NRE i ceaiceaen mee ¢ ey eee  *” LR.C. § 1501;  Reg. § 1.1502-75(b)(1).  8   Reg. § 1.1502-75(a)(2), (c)(1),  (d)(1). 69 Reg: § 1.1502—75(d)(1). 70 Reg. § 1.1502—75(c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)@ii). 7 Reg. § 1.1502-1(a), (h).  ™   Reg. § 1.1502-2(a).

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS   609  Each member’s separate taxable income   must be determined   by making  several adjustments, the most significant of which are (1) the  adjustments that take into account   transactions between members of the  group (so-called “intercompany transactions”) and transactions that relate to the stock, bonds and other   obligations of the members (such as  intercompany distributions), and (2) the omission of certain items of income and deduction that must be determined on a consolidated basis.74  After   these adjustments, the separate taxable incomes of the members  are combined. Next, the items of income and   deduction that must be  determined on a consolidated basis are calculated in accordance with the  regulations and then added to or subtracted   from the combined separate taxable incomes. The resulting amount is the group’s consolidated  taxable income, which is subject to tax at the  21 percent rate specified in Section 11. Subject to certain restrictions, the consolidated   group is allowed credits against this tax (and the other federal   taxes to which it  is subject), including the general   business and foreign tax credits.75 For purposes of determining each member’s earnings   and profits, the group’s  consolidated tax liability also must be  allocated among the members.76  b.   COMPUTATION   OF   SEPARATE   TAXABLE   INCOME  Intercompany   Transactions.   As   the   first   step   in   determining   a  consolidated   group’s   consolidated   taxable   income,   each   member’s  separate   taxable   income   (or loss)   must   be   determined   as   if the   member  were   a   separate   corporation,   with   certain   modifications.77   One  modification   is   that   “intercompany   transactions”   must   be   taken   into  account   in accordance   with   the detailed   rules   set forth in the regulations.  An   intercompany   transaction   is a transaction   between   corporations   that  are   members   of   the   same   consolidated   group   immediately   after   the  transaction.78   Examples   include   sales   or   rentals   of   property,   the performance   of services,   the   licensing   of technology   (such   as   a   patent),  and   the lending   of money.’9 The essence of the   rules governing intercompany transactions can best  be understood   by first considering the effect of a transaction between two divisions of a single corporation.   For example, assume that  corporation X has   two divisions, S and B, and that   division S transfers  land   with a  fair market value of $100   and a basis   of $70 to division B in exchange for $100 cash. No taxable   event   occurs as   a result   of   the  transfers because   corporation X continues to hold   both the   land   and the  cash. Corporation   X   would retain a $70 basis   in   the   land   and the  ‘transaction would   have no   effect   on   X’s taxable   income.

The  character   and   other tax attributes   of this income   generally   would   depend  on   the activities   of divisions   S and   B with   respect   to the land.®°   Similarly,   |  if division   S leases   office   space   to division   B   in exchange   for an   annual  rental   payment   of   $100,   corporation   X’s   taxable   income   would   be  unaffected   because   the   arrangement   would   constitute   a mere   shifting   of  assets   within   one   taxable   entity. The   regulations   governing   intercompany   transactions   contain   a “matching   rule”   and   an   “acceleration   rule”   that   generally   attempt   to  approximate   the   results   of a   transaction   between   divisions   of a   single corporation.   Before   illustrating   this   point,   the   rather   complex terminology   employed   by   the   regulations   deserves   some   mention.   The regulations   refer to the selling member   in a transaction   as “S” and   to the buying   member   as “B.” S’s items   of income,   gain,   deduction   and   loss from an   intercompany   transaction   are   referred   to   as   its   “intercompany items.”8!   B’s   tax   items   arising   from   an   intercompany   transaction   (or  property   acquired   in   an   intercompany   transaction)   are   referred   to   as  “corresponding   items.”82   A   “recomputed   corresponding   item”   is   the corresponding   item   that   B   would   take   into   account   if S   and   B   were  divisions   in a single   corporation   and   the   intercompany   transaction   were  between   those   divisions.83  To return to the   illustrations set forth above in the context of a  consolidated return, assume that corporations S  and B are at all relevant times members of a consolidated   group and that,   in year 1, S sells land with a fair market value of $100   and a basis of $70 to B for $100 cash.   In year 3, B sells the land to an unrelated third party for $110. The sale  from S to Bis an intercompany transaction, and the $30   gain realized by  S is S’s intercompany item. Under the matching rule prescribed by the regulations, S takes its intercompany gain into account in computing its separate   taxable income only when B takes into account its  corresponding item.84 B has no corresponding item in year 1, and therefore S’s $30  gain is deferred.   In year 3, B realizes a gain of $10   ($110  amount realized less $100 basis   in the  land),85 which is B’s corresponding item. B  must take this $10 into account in accordance   with its method of  accounting.86 Assume that under B’s method of accounting B takes   the ee Oe ae See ae 81 Reg. § 1.1502-13(b)(2)(i),  82 Reg. § 1.1502-13(b)(3)(i). 83 Reg. § 1.1502-13(b)(4). 84 Reg. § 1.1502-13(c)(2)(ii).  85 B  obtained a $100 cost b from S.

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS  $10 gain into account in year   3 in computing its separate taxable income.  Under the matching rule, S takes its $30 intercompany gain into account to reflect the   difference between B’s corresponding item ($10) and the  recomputed corresponding item, i.e., the gain that B would have   taken  into account in year   3 if S  and B were divisions of a single corporation. If S and B were divisions, B would have received the land from S with a $70  basis and therefore would have realized on the sale in year   3 a $40 gain, which is the recomputed corresponding item. Thus, S  would take into  account in year   3 the   difference between this recomputed corresponding item ($40) and B’s corresponding item ($10), or $30. The   result   in this   example   is similar   to the   illustration   above   when  S and   B   were   divisions   of a   single   corporation.   There,   as   here,   no   gain  with   respect   to the   land   was   taken   into   account   in determining   taxable  income   until   the   land   was   transferred   to   a third   party.   In this   respect, the   regulations   treat   S and B   as   parts   of a single   taxpaying   entity.   The regulations   similarly   adopt   a single   entity   approach   with   respect   to the tax   attributes   of the   $40   gain   realized   by the   group,   such   as   the   gain’s character:   the   character   of   S’s   $30   intercompany   gain   and   B’s   $10 corresponding   gain   will   depend   upon   the   combined   activities   of S and   B with   respect   to   the   land.87   In   other   respects,   the   regulations   adopt   a separate   entity   approach.   For   example,   the   total   $40   gain   realized   is  allocated   partly   to   S and   partly   to B, each   of whom   takes   its portion   of the   gain   into   account   in   determining   its   separate   taxable   income.   In  general,   no   similar   allocation   would   take   place   for tax   purposes   if S and  B were   divisions   of a single   corporation. The   matching   rule   also   would   apply   to   any   other   intercompany transactions   between   S and   B, such   as a lease   of office   space   from   S to B  in   exchange   for   an   annual   rental   payment   of $100.   Assuming   that   B’s  payments   of   rent   are   currently   deductible   under   B’s   method   of  accounting,   S would   take   into   account   as   current   income   the   difference  between   B’s   $100   rental   deduction   and   the recomputed   rental   deduction  (zero), or   $100.88   Although   S and   B would   take   the income   and   deduction into   account   in   computing   their   separate   taxable   incomes,   the   items  effectively would   offset each other when   the separate   taxable   incomes   are  combined,   so   that   the   transaction   generally   would   have   no   net   effect   on  the   group’s   consolidated   taxable   income.  The   second   cornerstone of  the intercompany transaction   regulations,  the   acceleration rule, guards   against   situations in which S’s  intercompany items   and B’s corresponding items   cannot   be   taken into  account   under the matching rule to produce the effect   of treating S and  B as divisions   of a single   corporation.®?   In that case, B continues to take  Qe oe EEE 87 Reg. § 1.1502-13(¢)(1)().   me!  8   Reg. § 1.1502—13(c)(7) (ii) Example 8.

612  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  its corresponding items into account in accordance with its method of  accounting, but S’s intercompany items are taken into account  immediately before it first becomes impossible to achieve the effect of  treating S   and B as divisions, ie.,   S’s intercompany items are accelerated. To illustrate, assume that immediately after S sells the - land to B in year 1 in the example above, the common parent sells all the stock of B to an unrelated third   party. Because B no longer is a member  of the consolidated   group that includes S, the effect of treating S and B  as divisions cannot be achieved. The acceleration rule therefore requires  S to take its $30 of intercompany gain into account in year 1.9! B would take any gain or loss on a subsequent sale of the land to a third party  into account in accordance with B’s method of accounting, and this gain or loss would be reported either on B’s separate   return or, if B is   a  member of another   consolidated group, on that group’s consolidated  return.  Even   if an   item   is   taken   into   account   under   the   intercompany  transaction   rules   described   above,   the item   can   be deferred   or   disallowed  under   another   provision.   For example,   Sections   267(f)   (deferral   of certain losses),   269   (acquisitions   to   evade   or   avoid   tax),   and   482   (allocations  among   commonly   controlled   taxpayers)   all potentially   may   apply.22  Intercompany Distributions. The regulations also require  adjustments to the separate   taxable incomes of group members for  certain transactions   with respect to   a member’s stock and other  obligations. This   discussion will be   confined to an overview of the  treatment of distributions to which Section   301 applies.9%  An “intercompany distribution” is an intercompany transaction to  which § 301 applies.9%4 Thus, an ordinary cash   distribution made by corporation S to its parent, corporation P, both of whom are members of the same affiliated group immediately after the   distribution, is an intercompany distribution. Intercompany distributions   generally are excluded   from the   gross  income of the distributee member.% This   exclusion from income is available, however, only to the extent   that   there is   a corresponding negative adjustment in the   distributee member’s basis in the   stock of the  distributing member.96 This   negative adjustment is made pursuant to the basis adjustment rules set forth  in the  regulations.97 Under the basis adjustment rules, a distribution   (and  certain   other   tax items)   effectively  90 Reg. § 1.1502-13(d)(1)(i), (d)(2)@i).  91 See   Reg. § 1.1502-13(d)(3) Example 1(e).  92 Reg. § 1.1502-13(a)(4).  98 See Chapter 4, supra. 4 Reg. § 1.1502-13()(2)(i).

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS  can reduce the distributee member's basis below zero.98 This negative  amount is referred to as the distributee member’s “excess loss account.”99  Thus,   provided that   the distributee member reduces its basis in the  distributing member’s stock, the distributee   does not recognize   gain on  an intercompany distribution, even if the distribution exceeds the  distributee members basis.1°0 A subsequent disposition of the  distributing member’s stock, however, will cause the amount of the excess loss account to be included in the distributee member’s gross  income.  A   corporation   that   distributes   appreciated   property   to   its  shareholders   generally   recognizes   gain,   but   not   loss.191   These   rules   are modified   in the   context   of a consolidated   return.   From   the   distributing member’s   perspective,   intercompany   distributions   of property   in   effect  are   treated   in the   same   manner   as   the   intercompany   sales   of property  examined   earlier.   Thus,   if in year   1 distributing   member   S distributes  appreciated   property   to its parent,   member   P, and P sells the property   to an   unrelated   third   party   in year   3, S would   not   take   its gain into account in   computing   its   separate   taxable   income   until   year   3.192   If instead   S realizes   a loss on   the   distribution,   then   the tax consequences   to S depend on   P’s actions   with   respect   to the   property.   If P sells the property   in year 3 to an   unrelated   third party,   and   under   P’s method   of accounting   P takes  into   account   in that   year   its gain   or   loss   on   the   sale,   then   S would   take its loss into account   in year   3.13   In contrast,   if P distributes   the property  to   its shareholders   and   realizes   no   further   gain   or   loss,   then   8’s loss   is  disallowed   and   never   taken   into   account.1°4   The   general   effect   of these rules   is to treat   P and   S as divisions   of a single corporation:   both   gain and  loss   are   taken   into   account   if the   property   is sold   outside   the   group   but,  in accordance   with   the   general   rules   of Sections   311(a)   and   (b), only gain is taken   into   account   if the   property   is transferred   outside   the group   in a  distribution   to a shareholder.  c.   CONSOLIDATED   ITEMS  In calculating   consolidated   taxable   income, certain items of income  and   deduction are taken into account on a consolidated basis. That is,  these   items   generally are omitted in calculating the separate   taxable  income of each   consolidated   group member and   aggregated with like  items   from the   other members.   The net amount of each   item is added to  or subtracted   from the sum of  the members’ separate   taxable incomes (as  ee eres 1 9 Reg. § 1.1502—32(a)(3)(1i). 99   Td.  100 This rule,   of  course, is contrary to the   general rule   of Section   301(c)(3)(A).  101   T.R.C.   § 311(a),   (b).  102 Reg. § 1.1502-13(f)(2)(ui),   —13(f)(7) Example 1.  103 See   Reg. § 1.1502-13(c)(6)(@),   ~13(f)(7) Example 1(d).  If S  distributed   the  property   toa shareholder   who is not a member of  the   affiliated   group,   however,   then S would not   recognize its  loss under   the  general   rule   of  Section   311(a).

The   items   that   must be taken   into account   on   a consolidated   basis   include   capital   gain or loss, gain   or   loss   with   respect   to   Section   1231   property,   the   charitable   and dividends   received   deductions,   and   the   deduction   for   net   operating losses.196   The   regulations   provide   detailed   rules   on   the   manner   in which   ~  the consolidated   amounts   of these   items   must   be determined. 107  Consolidated   items   may   be affected   by the intercompany   transaction rules.   For   example,   if one   member   of a   consolidated   group   realizes   a capital   gain   from   the   sale   of property   to   another   member,   the   selling member’s   gain   may   be   deferred   until   a   later   year.   If so,   then   the   gain would   not be taken   into   account   in determining   the   group’s   consolidated  capital   gain or loss.198  d.   ALLOCATION   OF   TAX   LIABILITY  Once   the total tax liability of a consolidated   group   is determined,   the  liability   must   be   allocated   among   the   members   for   purposes   of determining   each   member’s   earnings   and   profits.1°?   A   corporation’s  federal   income   tax liability during the year   generally   reduces   its earnings  and profits.110 Among   other   effects, this reduction   in earnings   and   profits  may   affect   the   characterization   under   Section   301   of distributions   made by the   members.  Section 1552   provides three methods   pursuant to which an affiliated group can make this allocation and also permits the group to select any other   allocation method with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.1"1 Under the first method, the group’s tax liability generally is allocated based on the ratio   of each member’s separate   taxable income to  the sum of the separate   taxable incomes of all members.112 For this  purpose, a member's separate   taxable income generally is calculated under the   rules discussed earlier (e.g., by applying the intercompany  transaction rules) and then   adjusted for certain items specified in the regulations.113 Under the second method, the   group’s tax liability  similarly also is allocated using a ratio, but in  this case each member’s  separately computed tax liability is compared to the sum of the members’  separately computed tax liabilities.114 Again, certain adjustments are  105   Reg.   § 1.1502—11(a).  106 Id.

CHAPTER 13 AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS  required in computing the separate tax liability of each member.15 The third method generally involves comparing each member’s tax liability  determined on both a consolidated basis (under the first method) and a  separate basis (under the second method) and reallocating any increases  in tax lability resulting from consolidation (i.e., any excess of the amount allocated to a member under the first method over the amount allocated  under the second method) to those members who experience decreases in  tax hability due to the consolidation.116  The   regulations   issued   under   Section   1502   that address   adjustments to   earnings   and   profits   for   members   of   a   consolidated   group   provide  certain   additional   allocation   methods.1!7  4.   STOCK   BASIS   ADJUSTMENTS  Consistent   with   the   general   purpose   of the consolidated   return   rules  to   treat   members   of an   affiliated   group   as   a   single   taxpaying   unit,   a member’s   basis   in   the   stock   of another   member   is adjusted   upward   or  downward   to reflect   the   subsidiary   member’s   distributions   and   its items  of   income,   gain,   deduction   and   loss.118   This   rolling   basis   mechanism  prevents   the   shareholder-member   (“P”) from   incurring   a second   round   of corporate   level   tax,   or   enjoying   a   double   deduction,   with   respect   to its investment   in S when   8’s income   or loss already   has been   reflected   in the  group’s   consolidated   return. In general,   P’s stock basis   is increased   by 8’s taxable   and tax-exempt income,   and   is   decreased   by   S’s   taxable   loss,   any   noncapital, nondeductible   expenses   of S, and   any   distributions   that   S makes   with  respect   to its stock.!19   The   regulations   contain   a host   of special   rules   for  computing   each   of   these   items.   Contrary   to   the   Code’s   conventional wisdom   that   a negative   basis   is impermissible,   the   consolidated   return rules   allow   the   effective   equivalent   of a negative   basis.   When   the   items  that   decrease   basis   reduce   P’s basis   to zero,   any   further   reductions   create an   “excess   loss   account.”!20   In   general,   P   must   take   into   account   as  income   or gain the   amount   of its excess   loss account   when   it is treated   as  having   disposed   of the   S stock.1#1  For example, assume that   the S stock   held by  P has a  fair market  value of $100   and an adjusted basis   of zero, and that during the  taxable year S has   $10 of tax-exempt   income   and also makes a $20 distribution to  P. The   $10 of tax-exempt   income   would increase P’s basis by $10. The  $20   distribution would reduce P’s basis to zero and also would create a “$10   excess loss account. If P then sells the S stock for $100, P will have a  5   Reg.   § 1.1552—1(a)(2)(ii).  16   J.R.C. § 1552(a)(3);   Reg. § 1.1552-1(a)(8). 17   ‘Reg. § 1.1502-33(d).  8   Reg.   § 1.1502-32(a)(1).  19   Reg.   § 1.1502—32(b)(2). 120 Reg.   § 1.1502-32(a)(3)(ii);   1.1502—19(a)(2). 121 Reg.   §  1.1502-19(b)(1),   (c).  615

ADVANTAGES   AND   DISADVANTAGES   OF   FILING   A  CONSOLIDATED   RETURN  Given   the   highly   complex   rules   confronting   filers   of consolidated  returns,   one   might well ask whether   the ordeal is really a “privilege.”   The  answer   is that   filing   a consolidated   return   is not   always   advantageous.  An   affiliated   group,   with   the   aid of its accountants   and   tax counsel,   must  carefully   assess   the   potential   pros   and   cons.   To   a   large   extent,   this assessment   involves   predicting   the   future   direction   that   the   group   will take   in its business   and   the   likely performance   and   tax   position   of each member. The   advantages   of filing a consolidated   return   include   the   ability   to  offset   income   of one   member   with   the   losses   of another,   the   exclusion   of  dividends   from   the distributee   member’s   gross   income,   and   the   ability to defer   recognition   of gain   on   intercompany   transactions.   Disadvantages  include   compliance   with   a complex   set of regulations,   and   the permanent  nature   of   the   election   to   file   a   consolidated   return   (i.e.,   the   group generally   must   continue   to   file   a   consolidated   return   even   if doing   so  turns   out to be disadvantageous   relative   to filing separate   returns).   Thus,  an   assessment   of the   desirability   of filing a consolidated   return   involves considering   issues   such   as   the   extent   to which   each   member   will   have taxable   income   or loss, whether   any   limitations   exist on   the ability to use losses   of one   member   against   income   of another,   the   extent   to which   the members   will   engage   in intercompany   transactions   and   the   effect   of the  intercompany   transaction   rules   on   those   transactions,   and   the likelihood  of current   members   leaving   or new   members   entering   the   group.  PROBLEMS  1. Corporation   P  owns 90% of Corporations A and B. Corporations A and B each own   40% of Corporation C. Corporation   C  owns 80% of Corporation  D. Corporation D owns   100% of Corporation K, a tax-exempt organization. Corporation   E  owns   100% of Corporation   F  which   owns 100% of Corporation  G.  All of the indicated percentages reflect   total voting power   and total value  owned   by the shareholder.  (a) To what extent   do   the above   corporations constitute   an “affiliated group”?  (b) What result   in (a), above, if Corporation B sells 10% of its stock in Corporation   C? 2.

CHAPTER   14  ANTI-AVOIDANCE   RULES  A.   INTRODUCTION  The   preceding   chapters   have   demonstrated   how C   corporations   and  their   shareholders   have   sought   to lessen   the   impact   of the   double   tax   on  corporate   profits,   avoid   the   higher   marginal   individual   tax   rates   on  ordinary   income,   convert   ordinary   income   to   capital   gain   and   use   tax  shelters   to reduce   income   taxes   at the   corporate   and   shareholder   levels.  Congress   has   responded   with   a   host   of   anti-avoidance   rules,   many  targeting   discrete   problems   and   others   seeking   a more   global   solution   to  errant   taxpayer   behavior. This   chapter   begins   with   a   closer   look   at   the   economic   substance  doctrine,   whose   common   law   roots   were   previewed   in   Chapter   1.  Congress   eventually   codified   this   venerable   doctrine   and   sharpened   its  bite   with a strict   liability   penalty   that   gives   the   IRS   a powerful   weapon  in   its   battle   against   corporate   tax   shelters   and   other   tax-avoidance  motivated   transactions.  The   chapter   continues   by examining   two   anti-avoidance   provisions that   historically   have   been   major   roadblocks   to taxpayer   exploitation   of  Subchapter   C:   the   accumulated   earnings   tax   and   the   personal   holding company   tax. These   penalty taxes   are   designed   to prevent   taxpayers   from escaping   the   higher   individual   tax   rates   by   accumulating   operating income   of a business   in a   more   lightly   taxed   C corporation   or   using   the corporation   as   a vehicle   to reduce   the tax burden   on personal   service   and  investment   income.   Thus,   these   penalty   regimes   assume   a   more important   role   when   individual   tax   rates   are   significantly   higher   than corporate   tax   rates.   With   the   top individual   rate   now   37 percent   and   the corporate   tax   rate   a flat 21   percent,   we   are   in a tax   environment   where the   accumulated   earnings   tax   and   the   personal   holding   company   tax assume   greater   importance.   Taxpayers   who   seek   refuge   in   a   C  corporation   from   the   higher   individual   tax   rates   potentially   must navigate   these   venerable   anti-abuse   provisions.   This   chapter   provides   an overview   of the   two   penalty   taxes   by   exploring   their   contours   without becoming   distracted   by too   many   details.  B. THE   ECONOMIC   SUBSTANCE   DOCTRINE  1. BACKGROUND:   CORPORATE   TAX   SHELTERS The   economic   substance   doctrine   evolved as   a weapon   used   by the  IRS   and   applied   by   the   courts to deny tax   benefits   arising   from  transactions   that   complied   with   the   literal language   of   the   Internal Revenue   Code   but   lacked   an   independent   business   purpose or   did   not  619

620   TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS   PART 2  result   in any   meaningful   change   in a taxpayer’s   economic   position   apart  from   the   reduction   of   federal   taxes.   The   most   prevalent   recent application   of the   economic   substance   doctrine   has   been   in   connection with   corporate   tax   shelters,   which   are   transactions   designed   and  marketed   for   the   purpose   of substantially   reducing   the   tax   liability   of profitable   corporations   and   their   wealthy   executives   and   shareholders.! Corporate   tax   shelters   are   typified   by   these   characteristics:   (1) realization   of tax   losses   without   corresponding   economic   loss   through  transactions   having   questionable   economic   substance   apart   from   the desire   to reduce   United   States   income   taxes;   (2) realization   of income   by  “tax-indifferent”   facilitators,   such   as   foreign   affiliates,   domestic  corporations   with   soon-to-expire   loss   carryovers,   and   tax-exempt  organizations;   (3) reliance   on   the   literal   language   or   ambiguities   in the Internal   Revenue   Code   to   support   a   result   that   may   be   technically defensible   but is inconsistent   with   the spirit of the law   and   well-accepted tax   principles;   (4) marketing   of transactions   under   a veil   of secrecy   by entrepreneurial   accounting   firms   and   investment   banks   in exchange   for  enormous   fees;   (5) inconsistent   treatment   for   financial   accounting   and  tax   purposes   of items   resulting   from   the   same   transaction;   and   (6) the willingness   of corporate   managers   and   their   advisors,   emboldened   by “reasoned”   opinions   of tax   counsel?   and   the   knowledge   that   IRS   audits have   been   reduced,   to play   “audit   roulette”   by taking   questionable   tax return   reporting   positions   with   the hope   (and expectation?)   that they will  never   be scrutinized.   A crisper   and   perhaps   more   informative   definition was   once   proposed   by Professor   Michael   Graetz,   who   characterized   a tax  shelter   as   “a   deal   done   by   very   smart   people   that,   absent   tax  considerations,   would   be very   stupid.”3  An attack on corporate tax shelters proceeded for Many years on  multiple fronts. Developments included piecemeal legislation, changes to the   rules governing tax practice   before   the Internal Revenue Service, a  sprinkling of test cases involving   high profile taxpayers and, as discussed below,   codification of the economic   substance doctrine and a strict no  fault penalty for taxpayers who violate it. Key   components of   this campaign have been: (1) disallowance of  tax benefits derived in certain types of  “listed” tax avoidance transactions;‘/ (2) disclosure   rules   that  require taxpayers to put the   Service on   notice if they   have engaged in  “reportable”   transactions   and require promoters   and tax advisors to  ny  ' See, e.g., Joint Committee on Taxation, Background and   Present Law Relating to Tax Shelters (JCX—19-02),   March 19, 2002; Symposium on Corporate   Tax Shelters,   Part 55) Tax  L. Rev.   No.   2 (Winter 2002);   Part II, 55 Tax L. Rev.   No.   3  (Spring 2002).  ‘ An Le of counsel   assuring a taxpayer that a transaction is “more likely than not”  0 achieve its intended purpose, may insulate   the taxpayer   from  various civil   penalties. See  , . See, e.g., LR.C. § 6662(a), (d); Reg. § 1.6662-4.   :  3 See, e.g., Tom   Herman, “Tax   Report,”   Wall St. J.,  at A-1 (Feb.   10,  1999). A “listed” transaction is one   that   the   Service   formally   determines to have a potential for  tax   avoidance or evasion.   See I.R.S. Notice   2009-59,   2009-31 LR.B i Seta ee ieee i -h.B.   170,  for  an updated list  4

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  “register” corporate tax shelters before the transaction occurs;5 (3)  enhanced substantial understatement penalties for items attributable to  corporate tax   shelters;® (4) stiff no-fault penalties for failure to comply with the tax shelter disclosure requirements;7   and (5) heightened regulation of the conduct of professional   advisors who provide   opinion letters and participate in the marketing of corporate tax   shelters.’ To bolster   the assault, some commentators have gone so far as   to propose that   public companies be required to compute their taxable income   by  reference to the income reported for financial accounting purposes,   with  only limited deviations permitted for valid   tax   policy reasons.9  The   Service’s   early   track   record   in the   test   cases   was   mixed   but   it  markedly   improved   as   more   courts   became   persuaded   to   apply   the  established   common   law   doctrines   to disallow   intended   tax benefits   from  tax-motivated   transactions.   Not   surprisingly,   the   Tax   Court   was  somewhat   more   inclined   to   apply   these   venerable   doctrines   than   the generalist judges   of the courts   of appeals.1°   The   United   Parcel   case,   which follows,   was   a   rare   taxpayer   victory.   It   offers   an   example   of how   the courts   apply   the common   law   economic   substance   doctrine   in a corporate  tax   shelter   case   involving   a familiar   company.  United   Parcel   Service   of America,   Inc.   v.   Commissioner  United   States   Court   of Appeals,   Eleventh   Circuit,   2001.  254 F.3d 1014.  m   COX,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE:  The   tax   court   held   United   Parcel   Service   of America,   Inc.   (UPS) liable   for   additional   taxes   and   penalties   for   the   tax   year   1984.   UPS  appeals,   and   we   reverse   and   remand.  I.   Background  UPS,   whose   main business is shipping   packages,   had a practice in  the   early 1980s of reimbursing   customers for  lost or damaged parcels   up  5 See, eg. LR.C. §§ 6011   (taxpayer must disclose reportable transaction); 6111  (organizers and   promoters   must register   potentially illegal shelters with the   IRS); 6112 (promoters   must   maintain lists of  clients who   purchase potentially illegal tax   shelters   and, on  request, must disclose these client lists to the   IRS); and Reg.   §§ 1.6011—4; 301.6711-1.  6   T.R.C.   §§ 6662(d)(1)(B);   6662A. 7   LR.C.   §§ 6707;   6707A;   6708.  = 8 See, e.g., 31 U.S. § 330(b), (d) and various implementing   changes to Circular 230, which regulates   professionals who practice   before   the Treasury Department (including   the   IRS). 9 See, e.g., Yin, “Getting   Serious About   Corporate   Tax Shelters: Taking a Lesson   from  History,”   54 SMU L. Rev.   209 (2001).  10 For  some tax  shelter   cases, most of which involve mind   boggling fact patterns, see, e.g.,  Coltec   Industries, Inc. v. United States,   454   F.3d   1340   (Fed. Cir. 2006);   Black &   Decker v.  United States,   340 F. Supp.   2d  621   (D. Md. 2004); Compaq v. Commissioner,   277   F.3d   778   (5th Cir.2001), rev’g,   113   T.C.   214   (1999);   Wells   Fargo v. United   States,   641   F.3d   1319   (Fed. Cir. 2011);   and   TIFD III-E,   Inc. v. United   States,   666   F.3d 836 (2d  Cir.   2012). One   of the   Service s  greatest   successes   was   in  a  federal   district   court   decision.   See   Long-Term   Capital   Holdings v.

622  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  to $100 in declared value.! Above that level, UPS would assume lability  up to the parcel’s declared   value if the customer paid 25¢ per additional  $100 in declared value,   the “excess-value charge.” If a parcel were lost or damaged, UPS would process and pay the resulting claim. UPS turned at  large profit on excess-value charges because it never came close to paying  as much in claims as it collected in charges, in part because of efforts it made to safeguard   and track excess-value shipments. This profit was  taxed; UPS declared its revenue from   excess-value charges as income on  its 1983 return, and it deducted as expenses the claims   paid on damaged or lost excess-value parcels.  UPS’s   insurance   broker   suggested   that   UPS   could   avoid   paying  taxes   on   the   lucrative   excess-value   business   if   it   restructured   the  program   as   insurance   provided   by   an   overseas   affiliate.   UPS implemented   this   plan   in   1983   by   first   forming   and   capitalizing   a  Bermuda   subsidiary,   Overseas   Partners,   Ltd.   (OPL),   almost   all of whose shares   were   distributed   as a taxable   dividend   to UPS   shareholders   (most  of whom   were   employees;   UPS   stock   was   not   publicly   traded).   UPS   then purchased   an   insurance   policy,   for the   benefit   of UPS   customers,   from National   Union   Fire Insurance   Company.   By this policy,   National   Union assumed   the   risk   of damage   to   or   loss   of excess-value   shipments.   The premiums   for   the   policy   were   the   excess-value   charges   that   UPS  collected.   UPS,   not   National   Union,   was   responsible   for   administering  claims   brought   under   the   policy.   National   Union   in   turn   entered   a  reinsurance   treaty   with   OPL.   Under   the   treaty,   OPL   assumed   risk commensurate   with   National   Union’s,   in   exchange   for   premiums   that equal   the   excess-value   payments   National   Union   got   from   UPS,   less  commissions,   fees,   and   excise   taxes.  Under this plan, UPS thus continued to collect 25¢ per $100 of excess  value from its customers, process and   pay claims, and take special  measures to safeguard   valuable   packages.   But UPS now remitted  monthly the excess-value payments, less claims paid, to National Union  as premiums on the policy. National Union then collected its commission, excise   taxes, and fees from the charges before sending the rest on to OPL as payments under the reinsurance contract. UPS reported   neither  revenue   from   excess-value   charges nor claim expenses on its 1984 return,  although it did deduct the fees and   commissions that National Union charged. The   IRS   determined a deficiency in  the amount of  the excess-value charges collected   in 1984, concluding that   the excess-value payment  remitted   ultimately to OPL had to be   treated as gross income to UPS.  UPS petitioned for  a redetermination.   Following a hearing,   the  tax  court agreed   with   the IRS.  a   Ee  1 These facts synopsize   the  high  points  of  the tax court’s long opini ich i   i  at  78  T.C.M.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  It is not perfectly clear   on what judicial doctrine the holding rests.  The court started its analysis by expounding on the assignment-of-  income doctrine, a source rule that ensures that income is attributed to  the person who earned it regardless of efforts to deflect it elsewhere. * * *  The court did not, however, discuss at all the touchstone of an   ineffective  assignment of income, which   would be UPS’s control   over the excess-  value charges once UPS had turned them over as premiums to National Union. * * * The court’s analysis proceeded rather under the substantive- sham or economic-substance doctrines,   the assignment-of-income doctrine’s kissing cousins. * * * The conclusion was that UPS’s redesign  of its excess-value   business warranted no respect. Three core reasons support this   result, according to the court: the plan had no defensible business purpose, as the business realities were identical before and  after; the premiums paid for the National Union policy were well above  industry   norms;   and contemporary memoranda and documents show  that UPS’s sole motivation   was tax avoidance. The revenue from the excess-value program was thus   properly deemed to be income to UPS  rather than to OPL or National   Union. The court also imposed penalties. UPS   now   appeals,   attacking   the   tax   court’s   economic-substance  analysis   and   its   imposition   of   penalties.   The   refrain   of   UPS’s   lead argument   is that the excess-value   plan had   economic   substance,   and thus  was   not   a   sham,   because   it comprised   genuine   exchanges   of reciprocal  obligations   among   real,   independent   entities.   The   IRS   answers   with   a before-and-after   analysis,   pointing   out   that   whatever   the   reality   and enforceability   of   the   contracts   that   composed   the   excess-value   plan, UPS’s   postplan   practice   equated   to its preplan,   in that it collected   excess- value   charges,   administered   claims,   and   generated   substantial   profits.  The   issue   presented   to this   court,   therefore,   is whether   the   excess-value  plan   had   the   kind   of   economic   substance   that   removes   it   from “shamhood,”   even   if the business   continued   as it had before.   The   question  of the   effect   of a   transaction   on   tax   liability,   to   the   extent   it does   not  concern   the   accuracy   of the   tax   court’s   fact-finding,   is subject   to de novo  review.   * * * We   agree   with   UPS   that   this   was   not   a sham   transaction, and   we   therefore   do not   reach   UPS’s   challenges   to the tax   penalties. II.   Discussion  LR.C.   §§ 11,   61, and 63   together   provide the   Code’s foundation   by identifying income as the basis   of  taxation. Even apart  from the narrower assignment-of-income   doctrine—which we   do   not address here—these sections come   with the gloss, analogous to that   on   other Code sections,  that economic   substance   determines   what is income to  a taxpayer   and  what is  not. *  * * This economic-substance doctrine,   also  called  the sham-  transaction   doctrine,   provides   that a transaction   ceases to merit   tax  respect when it has no “economic effects   other   than   the   creation   of tax  benefits.” * *  * 2 Even if the   transaction   has   economic effects,   it must   be  Corina Sh   to   Seer:  2 Kirchman,   which is binding   in   this   circuit,   differs   in this   respect   from   the   oft-used  statement   of the   doctrine   derived   from   Rice’s   Toyota   World,   Inc.  v. Comm’r,   752   F.2d   89,  91-92  623

624  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  disregarded if it has no business purpose   and its motive is tax avoidance.  KK *  The kind of “economic effects” required to entitle a transaction to  respect in taxation   include the creation of genuine obligations —  enforceable by an unrelated party. *** The restructuring of UPS’s  excess-value   business generated just such obligations. There was a real  insurance policy between UPS and National Union that gave National Union the   right to receive   the excess-value charges that UPS collected.  And even if the odds of losing money on the   policy were slim, National  Union had assumed liability   for the losses   of UPS’s excess-value  shippers, again a genuine obligation. A history of not losing money on a policy is no guarantee of such a future. Insurance companies indeed do  not make a habit of issuing policies whose premiums do not exceed the  claims anticipated,   but that fact does not imply that insurance companies  do not bear risk. Nor did the reinsurance treaty with OPL, while   certainly reducing the odds of loss, completely foreclose   the risk   of loss because  reinsurance treaties, like all agreements, are susceptible to default.  The   tax   court   dismissed   these   obligations   because   National   Union, given   the   reinsurance   treaty,   was   no   more   than   a “front”   in what   was   a  transfer   of revenue   from   UPS   to   OPL.   As   we   have   said,   that   conclusion  ignores   the   real   risk   that   National   Union   assumed.   But   even   if we  overlook   the reality   of the risk   and   treat   National   Union   as   a conduit   for  transmission   of   the   excess-value   payments   from   UPS   to   OPL,   there  remains   the   fact that   OPL   is an   independently   taxable   entity   that   is not under   UPS’s   control.   UPS   really   did   lose   the   stream   of income   it had  earlier   reaped   from   excess-value   charges.   UPS   genuinely   could   not   apply  that   money   to any   use   other   than   paying   a premium   to National   Union;  the   money   could   not   be   used   for   other   purposes,   such   as   capital  improvement,   salaries,   dividends,   or   investment.   These   circumstances  distinguish   UPS's   case   from   the   paradigmatic   sham   transfers   of income, in which   the taxpayer   retains   the benefits   of the income   it has   ostensibly  forgone.   ***   Here   that   benefit   ended   up   with   OPL.   There   were, therefore,   real economic   effects   from   this transaction   on   all of its parties.  The conclusion that UPS’s excess-value   plan had real economic  effects means,   under this   circuit’s rule   in Kirchman, that it is not   per se a sham.   But it could still be  one if tax avoidance   displaced   any   business purpose. The tax  court saw no business   purpose   here because the  excess- value   business   continued to operate after its reconfiguration much as before. This   lack   of change in how the business   operated at the retail level, according to the  court, betrayed the restructuring as pointless. It may be   true   that   there   was little change over time in how the excess-value program   appeared to customers.   But the   tax   court’s narrow notion   of “business purpose”—which is admittedly   implied   by the  (4th   Cir.1985).   Rice’s Toyota   World,   unlik as   a lack   of substance; Kirchman ex transaction   lacks   economic effects.   e  Kirchman, requires a tax-avoidance   purpose as well plicitly   refuses to examine   subjective   intent if the

--- Page 695 ---

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  phrase’s plain language—stretches the economic-substance doctrine  farther than it has been stretched. A “business purpose” does not mean a  reason for a transaction that is free of tax considerations.   Rather, a  transaction has a “business   purpose,” when we are talking about a going  concern like UPS, as long as it figures in a bona fide, profit-seeking  business. * * * This concept of “business purpose” is a necessary corollary  to the venerable axiom that tax-planning is permissible.   See Gregory v.  Helvering, 293 U.S. 465,  469,  55 S.Ct. 266, 267,  79 L.Ed. 596 (1935) (“The  legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would  be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted.”). The Code treats lots of categories of economically similar behavior differently. For instance, two ways to infuse capital into  a corporation, borrowing and sale of equity, have different tax  consequences; interest is usually deductible and distributions to equityholders are not. There may be no tax-independent reason for a  taxpayer to choose between these different ways of financing the business,   but it does not mean that   the taxpayer lacks a “business  purpose.”   To  conclude   otherwise would prohibit tax-planning.  The   caselaw,   too, bears   out this broader   notion   of “business   purpose.”  Many   of   the   cases   where   no   business   purpose   appears   are   about  individual   income   tax   returns,   when   the   individual   meant   to evade   taxes  on   income   probably   destined   for   personal   consumption;   obviously,   it is  difficult   in   such   a   case   to   articulate   any   business   purpose   to   the  transaction.   * * *   Other   no-business-purpose   cases   concern   tax-shelter transactions   or   investments   by   a   business   or   investor   that   would   not  have   occurred,   in   any   form,   but   for   tax-avoidance   reasons.   ***   By  contrast,   the   few   cases   that   accept   a   transaction   as   genuine   involve   a  bona   fide   business   that—perhaps   even   by   design—generates   tax benefits.   * * *  The transaction under challenge here simply altered   the form of an existing, bona fide business, and this case therefore falls in with those  that find an adequate business   purpose to neutralize   any   tax-avoidance motive.   True, UPS’s restructuring   was   more sophisticated and   complex than the usual   tax-influenced   form-of-business election or  a choice of debt over equity  financing. But its sophistication   does   not change the fact that  there was a real business that served the genuine   need for customers to  enjoy loss coverage   and for UPS to lower its liability exposure.  We therefore   conclude that UPS’s   restructuring of its excess-value  business   had   both real economic effects and a business   purpose,   and it  therefore under our precedent   had sufficient economic   substance to merit  respect in   taxation. It follows   that   the   tax   court improperly   imposed penalties   and   enhanced interest   on UPS for engaging in   a sham transaction.   The tax   court   did   not, however,   reach   the   IRS’s   alternative  arguments in  support   of its determination of deficiency,   the  reallocation  provisions   of I.R.C.   §§ 482   and   845(a).   The   holding   here   does   not   dispose  625

626 TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  of those arguments, and we therefore must remand for the tax court to address them in the first instance.  III.   Conclusion  For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment against UPS and — remand the   action to the   tax court for it to address in the first instance the IRS’s contentions under §§ 482 and 845(a).  REVERSED   AND   REMANDED.  a   RYSKAMP,   DISTRICT   JUDGE,   dissenting:  I respectfully   dissent.   Although   I agree   with   the majority’s   recitation of the facts   as   well   as   its interpretation   of the   applicable   legal   standard, I find   that   its reversal   of the   tax   court   is contrary   to the   great   weight   of  the evidence   that was   before   the lower   court.   The   majority,   as well   as   the  tax   court   below,   correctly   finds   that   the   question   before   the   Court   is whether   UPS’s   insurance   arrangements   with   NUF   and   OPL   are   valid  under   the   sham-transaction   doctrine.   Under   the   sham-transaction  doctrine,   UPS’s   transaction   ceases   to   merit   tax   respect   when   it has   no “economic   effects   other   than   the   creation   of tax benefits,”   * * * , or has   no  business   purpose   and   its   sole   motive   is tax   avoidance.   * *   * Thus   the question before   the Court   is not strictly whether   UPS   had   a tax avoidance  motive   when   it formulated   the   scheme   in question,   but   rather   whether  there   was   some   legitimate,   substantive   business   reason   for   the  transaction   as   well.   There   clearly   was   not. As the tax court articulated in great detail   in its well-reasoned 114- page opinion,   the evidence in this case overwhelmingly   demonstrates  that UPS’s   reinsurance arrangement with NUF and OPL had no  economic significance or business   purpose outside of UPS's desire to  avoid   federal income tax, and   was therefore a sham transaction. First,  the   tax   court based its decision upon evidence that   the scheme in question   was subjectively motivated   by tax avoidance.   For example, the evidence showed that   tax avoidance   was the initial and sole reason for the scheme in question,   that UPS held off on the plan for some time to analyze tax   legislation   on   the floor of the United States House of  Representatives,   and that a letter sent to AIG Insurance   from UPS  detailing the scheme claimed that AIG would serve   in merely a “fronting”  capacity and  would bear little or no actual risk. The   evidence   thus showed  that this scheme was   hatched   with  only tax avoidance in mind.  Second, the   tax   court based its decision   on overwhelming evidence that UPS’s   scheme   had no   real economic or business   purpose outside of  tax avoidance.   For  example, the evidence showed that NUF’s   exposure to loss under the plan   (except in   the   very   unlikely   event of extreme  catastrophe)   was   infinitesimal, and that UPS nevertheless   continued to fully bear   the administrative costs   of  the EVC program. NUF was   only  liable for  losses not  covered   by  another   insurance   policy  held  by  UPS,   yet  UPS still collected   the   EVC’s   and   deposited   the money into UPS   pant accounts, still processed   EVC claims,   and   continued   to   pay all EVC

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES   627  claims out of UPS bank accounts (while collecting   the accrued interest  for itself). All NUF really  did in the scheme was collect over $1 million in  fees and   expenses before passing the EVC income on to OPL, which was  of course wholly owned by UPS shareholders. In  essence, NUF received  an enormous fee from UPS in exchange for nothing.  Moreover, the tax court systematically rejected every explanation of  the scheme put forth by UPS. UPS claimed that   the scheme was meant to avoid violation of state insurance laws, yet  the evidence showed no real concern for such   laws and that in fact UPS was well aware that   federal  preemption of these state laws likely made its old EVC plan legal. UPS claimed that it intended OPL to become a full-line insurer someday, yet the evidence showed that it was   nevertheless unnecessary to specifically use EVC income for such a capital investment. UPS claimed that  elimination of the EVC income allowed it to increase its rates, yet  one of  its own board members testified that this explanation   was untrue. I also note   that UPS’s claim that OPL was a legitimate insurance company fails in  light   of the fact that OPL was   charging a substantially inflated rate  for EVCs. Evidence in the tax   court showed that in an arms-length  transaction   with a legitimate insurance company, EVC rates would have been approximately half those charged   by UPS (and in turn passed on to OPL), providing further evidence that   the transaction   was a sham. In  sum, UPS failed to show any legitimate   business   reason for giving   up nearly $100 million in EVC income in 1984.  For   these   reasons,   I would   affirm   the   holding   of the   tax   court   and  find that UPS’s   arrangement   with   NUF   and   OPL   was   a sham   transaction  subject   to federal   tax   liability.  NOTE  Corporate tax   shelters have not disappeared, but the most   aggressive transactions are   less prevalent as   a result of the   IRS’s enforcement efforts  and its success in several high profile  cases. The   new disclosure and   penalty  rules, which affect taxpayers   and their advisors, have sent a clear message  that  overly  aggressive   behavior may result  in serious economic   consequences going well beyond disallowance of the claimed tax  benefits. Even before   the economic   substance doctrine was codified,   well advised   taxpayers   were   put  on   notice   that if  a tax savings   strategy seems too good to be true, it should  be viewed with   appropriate   skepticism.  2. COMMON   LAW   ROOTS The proliferation   of corporate tax  shelters breathed   new life into  the  economic   substance doctrine. The   excerpt   below   elaborates   on   the  common law roots   of  the   doctrine   and its varying   interpretations   by the  courts.

628  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2 Joint Committee on Taxation, General Explanation  of Tax Legislation Enacted in the 111th Congress  (JCS-2-11)  369-372 (March 2011).  In general The   Code   provides   detailed   rules   specifying   the   computation   of  taxable   income,   including   the   amount,   timing,   source,   and   character   of items   of   income,   gain,   loss,   and   deduction.   These   rules   permit   both  taxpayers   and   the   government   to   compute   taxable   income   with reasonable   accuracy   and   predictability.   Taxpayers   generally   may   plan  their   transactions   in reliance   on   these   rules   to   determine   the   Federal  income   tax   consequences   arising   from   the transactions.  In   addition   to   the   statutory   provisions,   courts   have   developed several   doctrines   that   can   be   applied   to deny   the   tax   benefits   of a tax- motivated   transaction,   notwithstanding   that   the transaction   may   satisfy  the   literal   requirements   of a   specific   tax   provision.   These   common-law  doctrines   are   not   entirely   distinguishable,   and   their   application   to   a given   set   of facts   is often   blurred   by the   courts,   the   IRS,   and   litigants.  Although   these   doctrines   serve   an   important   role   in the   administration of the   tax   system,   they   can   be   seen   as   at odds   with   an   objective,   “rule-  based”   system   of taxation.  One common-law doctrine applied over   the years is the “economic  substance” doctrine. In  general, this doctrine   denies tax benefits   arising  from   transactions that   do not   result   in a meaningful   change to the  taxpayer’s economic position   other than a purported reduction in Federal income tax.990  Economic   substance   doctrine  Courts   generally deny   claimed tax benefits if the transaction that  gives rise  to those  benefits   lacks economic   substance independent of U.S.  Federal income tax considerations—notwithstanding that   the purported pare actually   occurred. The   Tax   Court   has   described the doctrine as  ollows:  The tax law ... requires that   the intended   transactions have   economic   substance   separate   and distinct from   economic  benefit achieved solely by tax reduction. The doctrine of  economic   substance   becomes applicable, and a judicial remedy  is warranted,   where a taxpayer seeks to claim   tax   benefits,  —— EE  __ 990   *  * * Closely   related   doctrines also applied by the   courts (sometimes   interchangeable with the economic   substance doctrine)   include   the “sham transaction   doctrine” re the  business purpose doctrine.” * *  * Certain   “substance over   form”   cases   involving   tax-indifferent  parties,   in which courts   have   found   that the  substance of  the  transaction   does   not  comfort   with  the form  asserted   by the   taxpayer,   have also   involved   examination of whether the change j  economic   position   that occurred, if  any,   was   consistent   with   the  form   asserted,   and   wheth Phe  claimed   business   purpose   supported   the particular   tax benefits   that  were   claimed ie

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  unintended   by Congress, by means of transactions that serve no  economic purpose other than tax savings.991  Business   purpose   doctrine  A common law doctrine that often is considered together   with the  economic substance doctrine is the business purpose doctrine. The  business   purpose doctrine   involves an inquiry into the subjective motives  of the taxpayer—that is, whether the taxpayer   intended the transaction  to serve some useful non-tax purpose. In making this determination,  some courts have bifurcated a transaction in which activities with non-  tax objectives have   been combined with unrelated activities having only  tax-avoidance objectives, in order to disallow the tax benefits of the  overall transaction.992  Application   by the   courts Elements   of the doctrine There   is a lack   of uniformity   regarding   the   proper   application   of the  economic   substance   doctrine.993   Some   courts   apply a conjunctive   test that  requires   a taxpayer   to establish   the presence   of both   economic   substance  (i.e., the   objective   component)   and   business   purpose   (1.e., the   subjective component)   in order   for the   transaction   to survive   judicial   scrutiny.99%4   A  narrower   approach   used   by   some   courts   is   to   conclude   that   either   a business   purpose   or   economic   substance   is   sufficient   to   respect   the transaction.99%°   A   third   approach   regards   economic   substance   and business   purpose   as   “simply   more   precise   factors   to   consider”   in  determining   whether   a   transaction   has   any   practical   economic   effects other   than   the creation   of tax benefits.996  One   decision   by   the   Court   of   Federal   Claims   questioned   the  continuing   viability   of the   doctrine.   That   court   also   stated   that   “the   use  of the   ‘economic   substance’   doctrine   to trump   ‘mere   compliance   with   the  Code’   would   violate   the   separation   of powers”   though   that   court   also found   that   the   particular   transaction   at   issue   in the   case   did   not   lack  economic   substance.   The   Court   of   Appeals   for   the   Federal   Circuit (“Federal   Circuit   Court”)   overruled   the   Court   of Federal   Claims   decision,  reiterating   the   viability   of   the   economic   substance   doctrine   and  concluding   that the transaction   in question   violated   that   doctrine.997   The  991 ACM Partnership v.

630  TAXATION OF C CORPORATIONS PART 2  Federal Circuit Court stated that   “[w]hile the doctrine may well also  apply if the transaction   has economic substance, a lack of economic  substance is sufficient to disqualify the transaction without proof that  the taxpayer’s sole motive is tax avoidance.”9%  Nontax   economic   benefits  There   also   is   a   lack   of uniformity   regarding   the   type   of   non-tax  economic   benefit   a taxpayer   must   establish   in order   to demonstrate   that a   transaction   has   economic   substance.   Some   courts   have   denied   tax benefits   on   the   ground   that   a   stated   business   benefit   of a   particular  structure   was   not   in   fact   obtained   by   that   structure.999   Several   courts  have   denied   tax   benefits   on   the   grounds   that   the   subject   transactions lacked   profit   potential.1°°0   In   addition,   some   courts   have   applied   the economic   substance   doctrine   to   disallow   tax   benefits   in transactions   in which   a taxpayer   was   exposed   to risk   and   the   transaction   had   a   profit  potential,   but   the   court   concluded   that   the   economic   risks   and   profit  potential were   insignificant   when   compared   to the tax benefits.1991   Under  this analysis,   the taxpayer’s   profit potential   must   be more   than   nominal. Conversely,   other   courts   view   the   application   of the   economic   substance doctrine   as   requiring   an   objective   determination   of   whether   a  “reasonable   possibility   of profit”   from   the transaction   existed   apart   from the   tax   benefits.1902   In   these   cases,   in   assessing   whether   a   reasonable possibility   of profit   exists,   it may   be   sufficient   if there   is   a nominal amount   of pre-tax   profit as   measured   against   expected   tax benefits.  Financial   accounting   benefits In determining   whether a taxpayer   had a valid business   purpose for  entering into a transaction, at least two courts have   concluded that  financial accounting benefits   arising from tax savings do not qualify asa non-tax   business   purpose. However, based on court   decisions   that recognize the importance of financial accounting   treatment,   taxpayers  have asserted that  financial accounting benefits   arising from tax savings can satisfy   the business   purpose test.  998 The Federal Circuit Court stated   that “when the taxpayer claims a deduction, it is the  taxpayer who bears the burden of proving that   the transaction   has economic substance.” * * * 99 See, e.g., Coltec Industries v.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  Tax-indifferent   parties  A  number of cases have involved   transactions   structured to allocate  income for Federal tax purposes to a tax-indifferent party, with a  corresponding deduction, or favorable basis result, to a taxable person. The   income allocated to the tax-indifferent party for tax nurpuses was structured to exceed   any actual economic   income to be   received by the  tax indifferent party from the transaction. Courts have sometimes concluded that this particular type of transaction did   not   satisfy the  economic substance doctrine.   In other cases, courts have indicated that  the substance of a transaction did   not support the form of income  allocations asserted by the taxpayer   and   have   questioned whether  asserted   business   purpose or other standards were met.  3.   CODIFICATION  Code:   §§ 7701(0);   6662(a),   (b)(6)   &   (i); 6664(a),   (c)(1)   &   (2). After   many   years   of consideration   and   controversy,   Congress   finally  codified   the   economic   substance   doctrine   and   added   a new   strict liability  penalty   in   the   Health   Care   and   Education   Reconciliation   Act   of 2010. Section   7701(0)   moves   the   economic   substance   doctrine   from   a   well established   but   murky   judicial   principle   into the Internal   Revenue   Code,  where   its   reach   is   still   far   from   clear.   The   final   successful   push   for codification   was   fueled   by   the   urgent   need   to   include   revenue-raising  provisions   in a health   care   and   tax bill that contained   spending   measures  and   some   tax breaks.   The   Joint   Committee   on Taxation   estimated   that it  would   generate   $100   million   in   2010   and   $4.3   billion   over   ten   years.14  The   projected   additional   revenue,   however,   was   not   mentioned   in   this  explanation   by the Joint   Committee   of the reasons   for codification:12  Tax   avoidance   transactions   have   relied   upon   the  interaction   of highly   technical   tax law   provisions   to produce   tax consequences   not   contemplated   by Congress.   When   successful,  taxpayers   who   engage   in these   transactions   enlarge   the tax gap  by gaining unintended   tax relief and by undermining   the overall  integrity   of the   tax   system. A strictly rule-based tax system   cannot efficiently prescribe the appropriate   outcome of every   conceivable   transaction that  might be  devised   and is, as   a result, incapable of preventing all  unintended   consequences.   Thus, many courts have   long recognized the need to supplement tax   rules with anti-tax-  avoidance   standards,   such as the economic   substance doctrine,  in order to assure   the Congressional   purpose is achieved.   The  Congress   recognizes   that   the IRS   has   achieved a number of  11 Joint Committee on   Taxation,   Estimated   Revenue Effects   of  the Amendment in  the Nature of  a Substitute to H.R.   4872   (J   CX-—17-10),   March 20,  2010.  12 Joint Committee on   Taxation,   General   Explanation of Tax   Legislation   Enacted in  the  111th   Congress   378   (hereinafter   “Joint   Committee   General   Explanation”),   JCS—2-11   (March  2011).  631

632   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  recent   successes   in litigation.   The   Congress   believes   it is still desirable   to   provide   greater   clarity   and   uniformity   in   the  application   of   the   economic   substance   doctrine   in   order   to  improve   its effectiveness   at deterring   unintended   consequences.  The   Congress   believes   that a stronger   penalty   under   section  6662   should   be   imposed   on   understatements   attributable   to  non-economic   substance   and   similar   transactions,   to   improve  compliance   by   deterring   taxpayers   from   entering   such  transactions.   The   Congress   is concerned   that   under   present   law  there   is a potential   to avoid   penalties   in such   cases   (based   for  example   on   certain   levels   of tax   advice),   and   that   the   potential  that   a   taxpayer   in   such   cases   may   pay   only   the   tax   due   plus  interest   is not   a   sufficient   deterrent.   The   Congress   therefore believes   it is appropriate   to impose   a new   strict liability penalty in such   cases.  Titled   “clarification of economic   substance doctrine,” Section   7701(0)  provides that any   transaction to which the economic   substance doctrine  is “relevant” shall be   treated as having   economic   substance only if the  transaction changes the taxpayer’s economic position in a meaningful  way (apart from the effect of federal income taxes) and the taxpayer has  a substantial purpose (apart from federal income taxes) for entering into the transaction.13   This is the more rigorous conjunctive test applied by  some courts of appeals. It requires an inquiry of both the objective effects  of the transaction on the taxpayer’s economic position and the taxpayer’s subjective motives for engaging in the transaction.   Failure to meet either  one of the two  prongs of the test  will cause the transaction under scrutiny to lack economic substance. The legislative history   notes   that “[t]he  provision   provides a uniform definition of economic substance,   but   does  not alter the flexibility   of the   courts in other respects.”14   In   the case of  individual   taxpayers,   Section   7701(0)   only   applies to transactions entered into   in connection   with a trade or business or investment activity; personal   transactions are excepted.15  In clarifying and enhancing the   doctrine, Congress   was   mindful of  its common law roots. To that   end, “economic   substance doctrine” is defined as the “common law doctrine” under   which the income tax benefits   with   respect to  a transaction are   not allowable if the transaction does   not have   economic   substance or lacks a business   purpose.16 The  determination of whether the economic   substance doctrine is “relevant”  to  a transaction is  to be made in the same   manner as  if the  provision had  never   been   enacted.17   This presumably   means that, despite all the hoopla 8 ER.C: § 7701(0)(1).  14 Joint Committee   General   Explanation,   supra   note 12, at  378.  © LR.C.   § 7701(0)(5)(B).

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  and projected   additional revenue to be collected from codification, the law has not fundamentally changed.   Or has it? Time and experience may tell. For   now, codification has clarified a few important points on which the  courts disagreed but also raised new questions of statutory interpretation.   For example, the   statute requires a taxpayer’s non-  Federal-income-tax purpose for entering into a transaction to be  “substantial” in order to satisfy the second   prong of the test. What does  it take for a purpose to be   “substantial?” Common law precedents,   such  as those under the Section   355 business purpose test,!8 may offer  guidance on this question. One point is resolved by the statute: a purpose of achieving a favorable accounting   treatment for financial reporting  purposes may not be taken into account as a non-Federal-income-tax  purpose if the   origin of the   financial accounting benefit is  a reduction of Federal income tax.!9  The   Joint   Committee’s   explanation   of Section   7701(o0)   states   that   a taxpayer   may   rely on factors   other   than   profit potential   in meeting   either prong   of the   conjunctive   test.20   But   if a   taxpayer   does   rely   on   profit potential,   the   statute   does   not   require   or   establish   a   minimum   return  that   will   satisfy   the   test,   only   that   the   present   value   of the   reasonably  expected   pre-tax   profit   must   be   substantial   in   relation   to   the   present  value   of   the   expected   net   tax   benefits   that   would   be   allowed   if the  transaction   were   respected.2!   It   is   expected   that   the   Treasury   will provide   more   guidance   on   the   operation   of these   new   rules.   The   statute  also   makes   it clear   that   fees,   other   transaction   expenses,   and   (possibly, subject   to IRS   regulations)   foreign   taxes   should   be taken   into   account   as  expenses   in determining   pre-tax   profit.?2 A major   concern   of those   who   opposed   codification   was   that   it might  be   interpreted   to   extend   to well-accepted   tax   planning   techniques   that  have   never   been   viewed   as   targets   of the   common   law judicial   doctrines.  The   Joint   Committee   on   Taxation’s   technical   explanation   responds   to  this   concern   with   what   has   become   known   as   an   “angel   list”   of  nonexclusive   transactions   that   Congress   does   not   believe   should   be  invalidated   by   a   strict   application   of the   economic   substance   doctrine. Examples   include:   (1) the   choice   between   debt   and   equity   financing;   (2)  the   choice   between   using   a   domestic   or   foreign   entity;   (3) the   choice   to enter   into   a   transaction   or   series   of   transactions   that   constitute   a  corporate   organization   or   reorganization;   and   (4)   related   party  transactions   that   do   not   run   afoul   of   Section   482.   This   unofficial legislative   history   (there   are   no   committee   reports)   also   states   that Section   7701(0)   should   not   be   used   to   disallow   tax   benefits   from   tax-  motivated   transactions   that   Congress   intended   to   encourage   through  18   See   Chapter   10C1,   supra.  19 J.R.C. § 7701(0)(1)(B), (0)(4).  20 Joint Committee   General   Explanation,   supra   note   12, at 381.  21 [.R.C. § 7701(0)(2)(A). 22   T.R.C.   § 7701(0)(2)(B).  633

634   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  provisions   such   as   the   low-income   housing,   rehabilitation,   new   markets  and   energy   tax   credits.?3  To   get   taxpayers’   attention   and   strengthen   enforcement,   Congress  buttressed   codification   of the   economic   substance   doctrine   with   a   new   | strict   liability   penalty   for   any   underpayment   attributable   to   a  disallowance   of claimed   tax   benefits   by reason   of a transaction   lacking  economic   substance   under   Section   7701(0)   or   failing   to   meet   the requirements   of   any   similar   rule   of   law.24   The   IRS   has   stated   that “similar   rule   of law’   means   a   rule   or   doctrine   that   applies   the   same factors   and   analysis   required   under   Section   7701(0)   for   an   economic substance   analysis   even   if a   different   term   or   terms,   such   as   sham  transaction   doctrine,   are   used   to describe   the   rule   or   doctrine.25  The   penalty   is   20   percent   of   the   amount   of   the   underpayment,  increased   to 40   percent   if the   taxpayer   does   not   adequately   disclose   the relevant   facts   affecting   the   tax   treatment   in   its   original   tax   return (amended   returns   are   too late to meet   the   disclosure   requirement   if filed after the taxpayer   has been   contacted   for audit).26   Unlike   most   other   civil  penalties,   taxpayers   may   not   rely   on   a   reasonable   cause   or   good   faith exception,   with   the   result   that   outside   opinions   of counsel   will   not   be   a  defense   to imposition   of the penalty   if it is determined   that   a transaction  lacks   economic   substance.27   However,   the   IRS   has   announced   that   it will  not   apply   the   penalty   unless   it specifically   invokes   the   codified   economic  substance   doctrine.   This   means   that   if the   IRS   relied   solely   on   other  judicial   doctrines   (e.g.,   the   step   transaction   doctrine)   to   support   the underlying   adjustment,   it will not   apply   the   Section   6662(b)(6)   penalty.28  Within moments after the economic   substance doctrine was codified,  anxious practitioners urged the IRS to provide guidance to resolve what they   believed to be ambiguities in the statute. In Notice 2010-62,29 the  IRS issued   “interim guidance” but it failed to calm the nerves of tax advisors in  their search for tidy solutions.   In  that   Notice,   the IRS said it would continue to rely  on “relevant case law” in applying the conjunctive  statutory test; it would not   issue rulings on whether or not the economic substance doctrine was “relevant” to   a transaction or, if it is relevant,  whether the transaction   complies   with the regulations of Section   7701(0);  and, contrary to hopes   and   expectations, it would not   issue   an angel list  of  safe transactions. The only meaningful   guidance in Notice 2010-62  relates to the adequate disclosure   procedures, which are   satisfied   on a timely filed original   tax return or certain amended returns.   For this purpose, “adequacy” is achieved   by   completing   IRS   forms (e.g., Forms Joint Committee General   Explanation,   supra note 12,  at 379.  24 TR.C. § 6662(b)(6). 25 Notice   2014-58,   2014-44   LR.B. 746. 26 LR.C. § 6662(i). 27 L.R.C. § 6664(c)(2).  8   Notice   2014-58,   supra   note   25.  29 2010--40   L.R.B.   411,

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  8275 or 8275-R) that are also used for purposes of the more general accuracy-related penalty regime in Section 6662.  The IRS also has announced that a “transaction” for purposes of  Section   7701(0) generally includes “all the   factual elements relevant to  the expected tax treatment of any investment, entity, plan, or arrangement, and any or all of the   steps   that are carried out as part of a plan.” Facts and   circumstances   determine whether a plan’s steps are aggregated or disaggregated when defining a transaction.29   This   IRS-  friendly standard generally   requires aggregation of all interconnected  steps with a common objective. But if there is  a tax-motivated step   that  is not necessary to achieving a non-tax goal, the “transaction” may include   only the non-tax step—i.e., a disaggregation approach could  apply.3! Thus,   disaggregation   and the relevance of the economic  substance doctrine are applied to some extent on a case-by-case basis under an all facts and   circumstances   approach designed to provide the IRS with maximum flexibility and to induce tax planners to be more cautious than they would have   been   without the codified economic  substance doctrine. In   declining   to   provide   more   specific   guidance,   the   IRS   appears   to  have   concluded   that   codification   of   the   economic   substance   doctrine  would   have   more   clout   if its contours   were   as   fuzzy   as   the   common   law doctrines   that   preceded   it   so   that   only   the   most   adventuresome   (or ignorant)   tax planners   would   risk the heightened   penalty   exposure.   Time  will   tell with   more   experience,   and   that   will   take   a while.®? PROBLEM  A   owns   100   percent   of the   stock   of T Corporation.   The   stock   has   a fair  market   value   of $200,000   and   A’s adjusted   basis   is $1,000,000.   P Corporation  wishes   to acquire   100   percent   of the   T stock   from   A in exchange   solely for P voting   stock,   but   A wishes   to recognize   the built-in   loss on   the stock   so it can be used   to offset a large capital   gain from   another   transaction.   Knowing   that  a   stock-for-stock   exchange   would   qualify   as   a   Type   B   reorganization   and preclude   A from   recognizing   his loss, A’s tax   advisor   suggests   that   P acquire  the   T stock   for   $199,000   of P voting   stock   and   $1,000   cash.   The   only   reason  for   using   cash   is   to   defeat   qualification   of the   transaction   as   a   tax-free  reorganization   and   allow   A   to   recognize   his   $800,000   loss.   P   Corporation agrees   to proceed   with   the   transaction   as   proposed   by A’s tax   advisor. (a)   Is the economic   substance doctrine   “relevant” to the  transaction?  30 Notice   2014-58,   supra note 25. 31 Id. The   disaggregation   approach   was   used in Coltec   Industries v. United States,  supra note 10, where the court   focused   on  one   step  in a complex   multi-step   transaction in applying the  common law   economic   substance doctrine.  32 For   an academic   perspective   that a lack   of comprehensive   regulations is  a good   thing  because   regulations   only  would   create   their own   ambiguities,   uncertainties   and   loopholes,   see McMahon,   “Living   With   the   Codified   Economic   Substance Doctrine,”   128   Tax   Notes   731   (Aug. 16, 2010).  635

636   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  (b)   Assuming   the   answer   to   (a) is yes,   is the   conjunctive   test   in  Section   7701(0)   satisfied?  C.   THE   ACCUMULATED   EARNINGS   TAX  1.   INTRODUCTION  For   most   of our   income   tax   history,   the   graduated   rates   applicable to individuals   greatly   exceeded   the relatively   flat corporate   rates.   During the   1950’s,   the   top   corporate   rate   was   roughly   50   percent   while individuals   were   taxed   at rates   ranging   up   to 88   percent.   This   rate   gap provided   an   incentive   for   taxpayers   to   accumulate   business   profits   or  investment   income   in a   corporation.   As   Professors   Bittker   and   Eustice  once   said, “use of a corporation   as   a temporary   or permanent   refuge   from  individual   income   tax   rates   has   been   one   of the   principal   landmarks   of our   tax landscape.”33  To illustrate a typical accumulation plan that would have invited   the  tax collector’s scrutiny, consider the   goals of Accumulator (“A”), a sole  proprietor   with a profitable business in the days of the   70 percent individual marginal rates. Tempted by the allure of the lower   corporate  tax rate, A incorporates his business   with a healthy (but permissible) dose of debt and pays himself a hefty (but reasonable) salary. His  personal consumption needs are   fully satisfied by the salary, the interest  payments on the debt, and as many nontaxable fringe   benefits as the  corporation can legally provide. Any additional profits from the business  are left to accumulate in the corporation, where they work to increase the  value of  A’s stock. If A needs more funds or later wishes to retire, he can “cash in” on   his accumulated profits by selling some stock or liquidating  the company, in either   case reporting   those profits as favored long-term capital   gain. An even more attractive alternative would be to avoid entirely  the individual income tax by holding the   stock until death, when  A’s  heirs would be entitled to  a stepped-up basis under Section 1014. Or  A might dispose of the business in a tax-free reorganization, emerging  with publicly traded stock,   albeit with a low   substituted basis, which  could   be sold or held until  A’s death.34 The   accumulated earnings tax was   enacted to prevent the   use   of a C corporation to escape the individual income tax by an unreasonable accumulation of earnings. Although not   part of its original   design, it also  serves   the broader   purpose of inducing   corporations to pay   dividends   and  subject   their earnings to the double tax when those profits   are   not  required for the reasonable   needs of  the  business.35  ee ee  33 Bittker & Eustice, Federal Income   Taxation of Corporatio   d  Sh  teas p ns an areholders 1.02  34 See I.R.C. §§  354;   358;   368.  35 See   Staff   of Senate   Finance   Committee,   Preliminary   Report on   the Reform   and Simplification   of  the Income   Taxation of  Corporations,   98th   Cone. 1st S i  ere p ; (5 ess. 23 (Comm.Print S.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  For a brief time between 1987 and 1992, the corporate income tax  rates exceeded the individual rates—an inversion from the historic norm  that caused   some commentators to propose repeal of the accumulated earnings tax on the ground that it was no longer  necessary.%6 Prior to the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,   the   top individual rate on ordinary income (39.6  percent) was slightly higher   than the  top corporate rate (35 percent). This small rate differential, along with the introduction of a preferential rate  on dividends received by noncorporate shareholders, reduced the  incentive to organize a business as a C corporation. The 2017 Act reduced  the corporate tax to a   flat 21 percent rate while slightly reducing the  highest individual rate to 37   percent. These   changes increased the potential tax benefits of operating a business as a C corporation. In this  rate environment, the accumulated earnings tax once again becomes a  lurking   presence that may act as an enforcer of the double tax regime   by  forcing   profitable companies to distribute some of   their earnings as dividends.  2.   THE   PROSCRIBED   TAX   AVOIDANCE   PURPOSE  Code:   §§ 531;   532. The   accumulated   earnings   tax   is a penalty   imposed   on   a corporation  “formed   or   availed   of for   the   purpose   of avoiding   the   income   tax   with respect   to   its   shareholders   * * *   by   permitting   earnings   and   profits   to  accumulate   instead   of being   divided   or distributed.”37   The   tax is levied   at 20   percent   on   a   C corporation’s   “accumulated   taxable   income,”   which   is  generally   defined   as   taxable   income   with   certain   adjustments   (e.g., subtracting   taxes   and   dividends   paid   and   adding   back   the   dividends received   deduction)   to   reflect   the   true   dividend   paying   capacity   of the corporation.38   Most   corporations,   regardless   of   motives,   are   given   an  accumulated   earnings   credit that in effect permits   an   accumulation   of up  to $250,000.39   Although   closely held   corporations   are   the principal   target  of the tax, Section   532(c)   provides   that its application   is to be determined “without   regard   to the   number   of shareholders,”   and   the   Tax   Court   has  held that in theory the tax can   apply to a publicly traded   corporation   even where   ownership   is not   concentrated   in a small   group   of shareholders.” As   a   practical   matter,   however,   publicly   traded   companies   are   rarely threatened   because   of the   difficulty   of proving   that   they   were   formed   for  the   proscribed   tax   avoidance   purpose.‘!   In   addition,   Section   532(b)  ~ 36 See, e.g., Wolfman,   “Subchapter   C and the 100th   Congress,” 33 Tax   Notes 669, 674 (Nov. 17, 1986). 37   T.R.C.   § 532(a). 38   T.R.C.   §§ 531;   535.  39 T.R.C. § 535(a), (c). A corporation is only   permitted a $150,000   credit if its principal  function is the performance of  services   in  the field   of  health,   law   engineering,   architecture,  accounting,   actuarial   science, performing arts  or consulting.

638   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  provides   specific   exceptions   from   the tax for personal   holding   companies,  tax-exempt   organizations,   and   passive   foreign   investment   companies.  The   central   issue under   the accumulated   earnings   tax is whether   the corporation   has   been   formed   or   availed   of   for   the   proscribed   tax   |  avoidance   purpose.   The   statutory   standard   is met   if tax   avoidance   is one of several   factors   motivating   corporate   accumulations.42   Two   statutory  presumptions   assist   in   determining   the   presence   of   a   tax   avoidance  purpose.   First,   the fact that   corporate   earnings   and   profits   are   permitted  to   accumulate   “beyond   the   reasonable   needs   of   the   business”   is  determinative   of a tax   avoidance   purpose   unless   the   corporation   proves to the   contrary   by a “preponderance   of the   evidence.”43   In   addition,   the fact   that   the   corporation   is “a mere   holding   or   investment   company”   is  prima   facie   evidence   of a tax   avoidance   purpose.44  The regulations   generally  provide that the presence of the proscribed  tax avoidance   purpose is determined   by all the circumstances of the particular case, including:45  (1) Dealings between the corporation and its shareholders, such as shareholder loans or corporate expenditures benefitting the shareholders personally; (2) The presence of corporate investments   having no  reasonable   connection   with the corporation’s   business; and  (3) The extent to which the corporation   has made dividend  distributions.  These factors are not conclusive,   but the presence of shareholder loans,  unrelated   corporate investments   and a poor dividend history   tend to  poison the atmosphere on the question of the proscribed tax avoidance  purpose. Application of the accumulated earnings tax thus ultimately  depends on the corporation’s   purpose. In United States v. Donruss,‘¢ a  decision   that   significantly strengthened the tax, the Supreme Court held that   the statutory standard   was satisfied if tax avoidance is merely one  of the purposes for the accumulation even if it is not   the corporation’s  dominant or principal   purpose.   After reviewing the   legislative   history, the Court acknowledged the difficulties   in applying   such a subjective  standard   and   expressed its preference for more objective criteria:47  Two conclusions can   be drawn from   Congress’ efforts. First,  Congress   recognized the tremendous difficulty   of ascertaining  ee ee re  teen ep 98th   Cong.,   2d Sess. 187   (1984); H.R.Rep.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES 639  the purpose of corporate accumulations. Second, it saw that  accumulation was often necessary for legitimate and  reasonable  business purposes. It appears clear to us that   the congressional  response to these facts has been to emphasize unreasonable accumulation as the most significant factor in the incidence of  the tax. The   reasonableness of an accumulation, while subject  to honest difference of opinion, is a much more objective   inquiry, and is susceptible of more effective scrutiny, than are the  vagaries of corporate motive.  Respondent   would   have   us   adopt   a test   that   requires   that tax   avoidance   purpose   need   be   dominant,   impelling   or controlling.   It seems   to us   that   such   a test would   exacerbate   the problems   that   Congress   was   trying   to avoid.   Rarely   is there   one  motive,   or   even   one   dominant   motive,   for   corporate   decisions.  Numerous   factors   contribute   to   the   action   ultimately   decided  upon.   Respondent’s   test would   allow   taxpayers   to escape   the tax when   it is proved   that   at least one   other   motive   was   equal to tax  avoidance.   We   doubt   that   such   a   determination   can   be   made  with   any   accuracy,   and   it is certainly   one   which   will   depend  almost   exclusively   on   the   interested   testimony   of   corporate  management.   Respondent’s   test   would   thus   go   a   long   way  toward   destroying   the   presumption   that   Congress   created   to meet   this   very   problem.   As   Judge   Learned   Hand   said   of the  much   weaker   presumption   contained   in the Revenue   Act of 1921  **   x   “Tal   statute   which   stands   on   the   footing   of   the  participants’   state   of   mind   may   need   the   support   of presumption,   indeed   be   practically   unenforceable   without   it xxx   » * * * And   “[tlhe utility of * * * [that]   presumption   * * * is well   nigh   destroyed   if * * *   [it] is saddled   with   requirement   of  proof of the primary   or dominant   purpose   of the accumulation.”  Barrow   Manufacturing   Co.   v.   Commissioner,   294   F.2d   79,   82  (C.A.   5th   Cir.1961),   cert.   denied   369   U.S.   817,   82   S.Ct.   827 (1962).  After Donruss, it became clear   that   the critical inquiry is the  reasonableness of  the accumulation.   As   previewed above, Congress   came  to the   aid   of  the fact finder by creating a statutory presumption   under  which an accumulation   beyond the reasonable   needs of  the  corporation’s  business is determinative of  the proscribed tax avoidance   purpose unless  the corporation   proves to the contrary   by a preponderance of   the  evidence.48   This   procedural device   eases   the Government’s   burden of  proof  and   immunizes a growing   corporation   that accumulates profits for  purposes   such as bona fide expansion,   potential   acquisitions, working capital   needs   and   other   valid  business   objectives.  a   a   eo  48   [.R.C.   § 533(a).

640   TAXATION   OF   C   CORPORATIONS   PART   2  The   presumption   is   rebuttable,   and   in   theory   a   corporation   that  accumulates   earnings   beyond   its reasonable   needs   can   avoid   the   tax   by  proving   that   the   accumulation   was   not   motivated   by   a   tax   avoidance  purpose.   As   the   Supreme   Court   stated   in Donruss:?#9 [W]e   cannot   subscribe   to respondent’s   suggestion   that   our holding   would   make   purpose   totally irrelevant.   It still serves   to isolate   those   cases   in   which   tax   avoidance   motives   did   not contribute   to   the   decision   to   accumulate.   Obviously   in   such   a  case   imposition   of the tax would   be futile.   In addition,   “purpose”  means   more   than   mere   knowledge,   undoubtedly   present   in  nearly   every   case.   It is still open   for the   taxpayer   to show   that even   though   knowledge   of the   tax   consequences   was   present, that knowledge   did not   contribute   to the   decision   to accumulate  earnings.  Few corporations, however, are able to make the requisite showing once it is determined that accumulations are unreasonable.5°   Conversely, even if an accumulation is found to be reasonable, the government  theoretically might   attempt to show the existence of the proscribed purpose.®! In  practice, however, the reasonable   business   needs standard  is almost always the main event, and it therefore will be the   focus of our  coverage.  3. THE REASONABLE   NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS  Code:   §§ 533(a);   534(a)—(c);   537(a), (b)(1).  Regulations: §§  1.537—1(a)—(c), —2, —3.  Myron’s   Enterprises v. United States  United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, 1977.  548   F.2d 331.  = SNEED,   CIRCUIT   JUDGE:  Taxpayer-corporations sued in   district court below for   a refund of  accumulated earnings taxes imposed   by the Commissioner.   The  Commissioner had  based the  tax  on  his determination that for taxpayers’ fiscal years   1966 through 1968 the reasonable   needs of the business stemmed entirely from working capital needs   and   never exceeded  49   393   U.S.   at 309.  50 For one   isolated example, see T.C. Heyward   & Co. v. United Stat =  | 9667   (W.D.N.C.1966),   where a federal district judge held  that the soepetiaets a Ene Se: were so large   that it never   could have   intended to avoid   the shareholder tax   be  would be  so obvious. Such cases are aberrational.   In  the   future, however it  is  sti that a publicly held  corporation   that is found to have made an unreasonable   accum contend that it lacked   the   proscribed   purpose   because it   is not   controlled  shareholder or insider   group.  cumulations  cause   no   one ll conceivable  ulation   might  by   any   single  iS   Such a showing  ultimately   would   be futile, however, in light of  Section 535(c)(1), which  provides a credit   against   the accumulated   earnings   tax   in an amount   equal to those earings which   have   been   accumulated for  the  reasonable   needs   of  the  business.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  $21,272. The taxpayers contended that their retained earnings for the  years 1n question of $316,000,   $374,816, and   $415,766 respectively were  needed to cover both working capital requirements of $100,000   and the planned   purchase and remodeling of the ballroom   operated by taxpayers,  at an estimated cost of $375,000.  The district court,   in Myron’s   Ballroom v. United States, 382 F.Supp. 582   (C.D.Cal.1974), held that taxpayers had accumulated earnings in  excess of the reasonable needs of  their business,   but not to the extent claimed by the Commissioner. The court also found that the taxpayers  had been availed of for the purpose of avoiding income taxes. Thus, the  court upheld the   surtax, but required a partial refund in light   of the Commissioner’s   underestimation of taxpayers’ reasonable business  needs.  The   taxpayers   argue   on   appeal   that   they are   entitled   to a full refund  (i) because   all   of the   retained   earnings   in   the   years   in   question   were  required   to meet   the   reasonable   needs   of their   business,   and   (ii) because they   proved   by   the   preponderance   of the   evidence   that   they   were   not  availed   of to   avoid   taxes,   despite   the   contrary   finding   by   the   district  court.   The   Government   argues,   1n response,   that taxpayers   were   not even entitled   to   a   partial   refund—that   the   Commissioner’s   initial  determination   of the   reasonable   needs   of the   business   was   correct   and  that   taxpayers   failed   to   prove   lack   of   tax-avoidance   motivation.   We conclude   that   the   taxpayers   are   entitled   to   the   full   refund   they   seek.  Therefore,   we   reverse   and   remand   for such   necessary   proceedings   as   are consistent   with   this   opinion.  I.  Taxpayer-corporations operate a ballroom   and adjoining cocktail lounge. At all times since taxpayers   were   formed,   they  have leased their  operating   premises   from   Miss Pear]   Rose, an   elderly lady who has owned  the property for approximately 30 years. The   taxpayers began inquiring  into the possibilities   of purchasing the property in 1957, in part because  they did   not wish to make needed improvements unless   they owned the building. Taxpayers   made offers to Miss   Rose of $100,000   and   $150,000 for the property in the late 1950s—early 1960s,   neither of which   was  accepted. However, at the   time of   the second offer, Miss   Rose told  taxpayers that they would   have “first choice” if and when she   decided to sell the  ballroom. In   1963, taxpayers   learned that Russ   Morgan, a former   orchestra  leader at the   ballroom,   had offered Miss   Rose   $300,000   cash for the  property, in  an attempt   apparently to take   over   the ballroom   operation.  The price   offered by   Morgan probably reflected   the goodwill that taxpayers   had built up in their operations   and  therefore  was   considerably higher   than   the  value   of the  ballroom   property   by itself. Morgan s actions  convinced   taxpayers   that their  business   could be involuntarily   “acquired  641

642   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  by   someone   purchasing   the   ballroom   from   Miss   Rose;   taxpayers,  therefore,   promptly   offered   Miss   Rose   the identical   sum   of $300,000.   This  offer   was   renewed   in 1964,   1965,   1966,   1967,   1968   and   1970.   While   Miss  Rose   never   objected   to   the   terms   of the   offers,   she   never   sold   and   still  owned   the ballroom   at the   time   of trial.  As   the   Government   points   out,   Miss   Rose   was   never   particularly clear   as   to   when   and   if she   would   sell   her   building.   Nevertheless,   the district   court   found   (a) that   taxpayers   “expected   at any   time   during   the years   1966,   1967   and   1968   that   [they]   would   be   able   to   purchase   the  ballroom   property   from   Pear!   Rose   for a price   of $300,000   cash,   no   less than   that   amount,   and   maybe   more,”   382   F.Supp.   at 587,   and   moreover (b) that   the “expectation   that the ballroom   property   would   be acquired   at any   time   during   the   years   in issue   was   a reasonable   expectation,”   id. at  588.   Thus,  “During the years in  issue, the acquisition of the ballroom property   and the planned improvements and repairs were reasonably anticipated business   needs of [taxpayers], and said  needs   were directly connected with the businesses of the corporations.” Id. The district court further concluded that “[clonsidering the reasonably anticipated   business   need of the corporations to purchase the ballroom property * * * the corporations combined required at least $375,000, in  addition to their combined   working capital needs of $100,000.” Id. However, the   court went on to hold   that in   light   of taxpayers’ sole- shareholder Mrs. Myrna Myron’s willingness to loan up to $200,000 to  her corporations for purchase of the ballroom “if the corporations did not  have sufficient funds to consummate the transactions, * * * a reasonable accumulation [for the purchase] would be $250,000,   with   Mrs. Myron  loaning the balance of funds required,” id., thus   leading to an   excess  accumulation in 1967 and 1968.  ip  Section   537 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that   the reasonable   needs of a business, for purposes of determining   whether  there   has   been an   excess accumulation of earnings,   include “the  reasonably   anticipated   needs of the  business.” Treas.Reg. § 1.537—1(b)(1)  provides that to justify   an accumulation of earnings on grounds of  reasonably   anticipated   business   needs, a corporation must   have “specific,  definite, and feasible plans for the   use   of such accumulation”   and   must  not postpone   execution of the plan “indefinitely.”  a  _ 3 _ While   taxpayers   had a lease and an   option to renew on   the ballroom   property at the time Morgan   made his $300,000 offer   to Miss   Rose,   there   was   always the   possibility   that   the  lease  could  be  broken or evaded.   According to Mrs.   Myron,   Morgan   had   asked his attorney   and Miss   Rose’s   agent “to review [the lease]   line by line to  see  if there   was   some   way or some word— something that   could break   the   lease.”   R.T.   at 73. This   possibility   of  a loophole   in  the lease left  the door   open for  an   Involuntary   “acquisition.”

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  The Government contends that  the district court erred in concluding that   the taxpayers   had a “specific, definite, and feasible plan” to acquire  and   remodel the ballroom. The Government notes that Miss   Rose never  agreed to sell the ballroom   and argues that taxpayers could not have  reasonably expected   Miss   Rose to so agree within the taxable   years in  question after nearly a decade of unsuccessful negotiations. We   agree   with   other   circuits   that   a determination   by the   trial court  of the reasonably   anticipated   business   needs   of a corporation   is a finding  of fact   which   must   be   sustained   unless   clearly   erroneous.   * * * A   court should   be   particularly   wary   of overturning   a finding   of a   trial   court supporting   the   taxpayer’s   determination   of   its   anticipated   business  needs,   since,   in   the   first   instance,   the   “reasonableness   of the   needs   is  necessarily   for determination   by those   concerned   with   the   management  of the   particular   enterprise.   This   determination   must   prevail   unless   the facts   show   clearly   the   accumulations   were   for prohibited   purposes.”   * * * We   conclude   that   the   district   court   was   not   clearly   erroneous   in finding that   taxpayers’   expected   purchase   and   remodeling   of the   ballroom   for  $375,000   was   a “reasonably   anticipated   need   of the business.”  The   Government   argues   that   if the   instant   plan   to   purchase   the  ballroom   is held   to be a reasonably   anticipated   business   need, “any   individual   could   organize   a one-man   corporation,   lease   a building   and   discuss   with   the lessor the purchase   of the building  at   some   future   time,   and   then   assert   that   in   the   meantime  business   needs   required   accumulation   of corporate   earnings.”  I.A.   Dress   Co.   v.   Commissioner   of Internal   Revenue,   273   F.2d 548,   544   (2d   Cir.),   cert.   denied,   362   U.S.   976,   80   S.Ct.   1060,   4  L.Ed.2d   1011   (1960). Such fears   of artificially constructed   needs   were   well-founded in the  quoted case   of I.A. Dress Co.; there, the owner of the building that   the  taxpayer   sought to purchase “was willing to   sell but at a price some  $300,000   more   than the taxpayer   was willing to pay.” Id. The offer of the  taxpayer lacked   substance   and could easily have   been a facade.   In  the  instant case, however, the taxpayers   were   extremely diligent in   their  attempts to purchase the ballroom; the taxpayers   agreed to all of Miss  Rose’s   stated terms—including   payment in all cash;   the  price  offered,   far  from   being criticized by  Miss   Rose as too low, was   apparently in excess   of the  property’s fair market value.°  5 The Government argues that in addition to these   steps the taxpayers also should   have  investigated purchasing other   property in the  general area, once Miss Rose did not prove totally  disposing. Cf. Magic Mart, Inc., 51   T.C. 775 (1969), acq., 1969 24C.Bs   XXIV. We agree that   the failure   of a taxpayer to look   into   the   possibility   of purchasing alternative   properties   generally will be a relevant factor   in determining   whether the taxpayer actually had a reasonably  anticipated   business   need to purchase the   sought-after   property. However, other   factors   also must   be   considered,   including   the uniqueness of  the   sought   property.   Here,   as  was testified   to  at  trial, a substantial   amount of  good will was tied   up   in  the   ballroom   occupied by taxpayers;  given   that   this  value   would   have   been lost if taxpayer   had moved   to another location,   we   do  not believe   that   taxpayers’   failure   to pursue   other   possible   properties (if other   ballrooms   even  existed)   calls for  reversing   the finding   of the  district   court.  643

644   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  Neither   do we   have   a situation   where   taxpayers’   planned   purchase  of the   ballroom   was   clearly   infeasible.   See   Colonial   Amusement   Corp., 1948   Tax.Ct.Mem.Dec.   (P-H)   48,149   (building   restrictions   and   priorities prevented   carrying   out   of expansion   plans).   Here,   as   in Universal   Steel Co.,   5   T.C.   627   (1945)   (war   priority   restrictions   temporarily   blocked purchase   of pickling   plant),   the   taxpayers   “had   a   right   to   hope,   if not  expect,”   id. at 638,   that   Miss   Rose   would   sell to them   in the   near   future.  Miss   Rose   never   foreclosed   the possibility   of sale   on   the   terms   offered   by  taxpayers;   she   merely   wanted   to “think   it over   some   more.”   As   expressed  by Miss   Rose’s   agent   at one   point during the negotiations,   Miss   Rose   “was  an   elderly   lady and   had a very   definite   mind”;   her   answers,   according   to the   agent,   would   differ   depending   on   how   she   felt   on   getting   up   in   the  morning.   Taxpayers   were   encouraged   at   several   points   in   the  negotiations;   in 1965,   Miss   Rose’s   agent had   told taxpayers,   “Be prepared and   ready   to   go.”   In   light   of the   reasonable   possibility   that   Miss   Rose might   have   decided   to   accept   the   offer   at   any   time   during   the   taxable years   in issue,   calling   for   quick   collection   of $375,000   in cash,   it would  have   been   unreasonable   to force taxpayers   to pay   out   all of their   earnings  in   dividends.   Section   537   allows   taxpayers   to   provide   for   “reasonably  anticipated   needs,”   not   merely   for certainties. The district court’s finding is supported   by several tax   court cases. In Magic Mart, Inc., 51   T.C. 775 (1969), acq., 1969-2 C.B. xxiv, the Tax Court held  that the taxpayer’s accumulation of earnings for 1959 through  1962 was   reasonable in  light  of taxpayer’s   plan to acquire enlarged   and expanded facilities, even though it had tried unsuccessfully to buy larger facilities since 1957 and   was not  able to close a deal until 1967 , five years  after the taxable   years in question.   In  Breitfeller   Sales, Inc., 28  T.C. 1164  (1957), acq., 1958-2 C.B. 4, the Tax Court held   that a General   Motors dealership’s accumulation of earnings   was justified, inter alia, by “the continuing possibility   that it might [to avoid harmful competition]   be  required to finance a new dealership in   [a neighboring   community].” Id. at 1168 (emphasis added).   See also Universal Steel Co., supra.  III.  The Government rests its entire   case upon the argued lack of a specific,   definite, and feasible   plan. No   attempt is made to support the trial court’s   use   of Mrs. Myrna Myron’s capacity to loan to the taxpayers  to reduce the amount of  the reasonable   accumulation.   The Government  thus   agrees   with   taxpayers that, assuming a feasible   plan,   the district court,   in determining   whether   taxpayers   unreasonably   accumulated earnings,   erred in subtracting   from the   cash needed to purchase the  ballroom an amount that  Mrs. Myron stated   that   she would be  willing to  loan   to.the taxpayers if necessary. We also   agree. Having   found   that   the  reasonably   anticipated   business   need of  the   taxpayers to purchase the

--- Page 715 ---

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  ballroom property required at least $375,000 in cash,   the district court  erred in concluding that a reasonable accumulation was   any less.6  Having determined that   the reasonable business   needs of taxpayers, within the meaning of section 535, equalled or exceeded the accumulated  earnings of taxpayers for the taxable years in question, it is unnccessary for  us to consider whether the district court was correct in holding that taxpayers   had   been availed of to avoid taxes within the meaning of  section 531. Taxpayers are entitled to  a full refund. The case is remanded  to the district court for such necessary   proceedings as are consistent with  this opinion.  Reversed   and   remanded. NOTE The   Myron’s   Enterprises   case   illustrates   the   essentially   factual   nature of the   “reasonable   business   needs”   issue.   By   the   time   a   case   reaches   the courts,   the   corporation   normally   has   compiled   a laundry   list of reasonable business   needs   to justify   the   accumulation,   and   triers   of fact   typically   are  reluctant   to second   guess   the   business   judgment   of corporate   management  in the   absence   of a clear   pattern   of abuse.   This   note   and   the   materials   that follow   it survey   the   principal   factors   taken   into   account   by the   Service   and the courts   in evaluating   the reasonableness   of a corporation’s   accumulation. Reasonable   and   Unreasonable   Needs:   In   General.   After   a   general  reminder   that   the   reasonableness   of a particular   accumulation   of earnings  and   profits   is dependent   “upon   the   particular   circumstances   of the   case,”5? the   regulations   provide   guidance   on   what   constitutes   reasonable   and unreasonable   accumulations.   If supported   by the facts, the following   grounds  6 That the reasonableness of accumulations should be judged   without   regard to the  borrowing capabilities of the corporation-taxpayer is well established by the case   law.   See, e.g.,  General   Smelting Co., 4 T.C.   313, 323 (1944), acq., 1945 C.B. 3; B. Bittker & J. Eustice, Federal  Income Taxation of Corporations   and   Shareholders 8-20 to 8-21 & n. 42 (3rd ed. 1971).   In  computing   “accumulated taxable   income,” which forms the base for the accumulated earnings tax, I.R.C. § 535   provides that a credit will be provided for the amount “retained for the reasonable   needs of the business.” There is no authority for reducing the credit to reflect the lending   capacity of taxpayer's   shareholders. If the reasonable   business   needs of taxpayer   equal  or outstrip   the retained   earnings, no surtax can be imposed, even though the needs could   be  financed by   borrowing from outside—such financing decisions are for the taxpayer, not   the courts   to make. The district   court’s   logic could conceivably be extended to the   point of  totally   nullifying Congress’   expressed policy   of allowing   corporate   taxpayers to accumulate earnings   necessary  for reasonable   business needs.   A sole shareholder can always loan back any cash   distributed by  his corporation in dividends if the corporation later needs the money (minus, of course, any  income taxes paid). Therefore, to take into account the   ability ofa   shareholder to loan money to  the   corporation   could   be   construed as virtual authority “for denying all sole stockholder  corporations the   right   ever to maintain   accumulations even for reasonable needs. The test  expressed   by the   statute would   then   be  completely   abandoned.” Smoot   Sand & Gravel   Corp. v.  Commissioner of  Internal   Revenue, 241   F.2d 197, 206   (4th Cir.),   cert. denied,   354   U.S.   922,   77  S.Ct.   1383,   1 L.Ed.2d   1437   (1957). 7  52 Reg. § 1.537-2(a).   The   Supreme Court   has   held that in ascertaining the  reasonable  needs   of  a business,   “readily   marketable portfolio   securities”   are to be   taken into account at  their   “net   realizable   value”   rather   than cost.

The   following   nonexclusive   list   of   purposes   “may   indicate”   that   the  accumulations   are   beyond   the reasonable   needs   of the business:54 (1) Loans to shareholders or expenditures for the personal benefit of the shareholders;  (2) Loans   having no reasonable relation to the conduct of the  business made to relatives or friends of shareholders or other  persons;  (3) Loans to another   corporation in a different business if the two  corporations are controlled,   directly or indirectly, by the same  shareholders;  (4) Investments unrelated to the corporation’s   business; or  (5) Retention of earnings   and profits to provide   against unrealistic  hazards. Anticipated Needs.   Section   537(a)   defines   the “reasonable   needs of the  business” as including the reasonably anticipated needs. To justify an  accumulation as being for a reasonably anticipated   need, a corporation must  have a business   need for the accumulation and must   have plans for the   use of the funds which are   “specific, definite and feasible.”55 The   accumulation does not have to be used immediately or even   within a short period of time as long as it is used   within a “reasonable period,” taking into account all the  facts and   circumstances.56 The corporation’s reasonably   anticipated   needs  are determined   based on   facts present at the close   of the   taxable year; subsequent events may not be   used to show that   the accumulation was unreasonable. Subsequent events, however, can   be considered to determine whether the corporation   actually intended to consummate its plans for the  accumulation.57   Moreover, if the  future   plans are   not completed, the presence  58 Reg. § 1.537—2(b).  ae) Reg. § 1.537-2(c):  55 Reg. § 1.537-1(b)(1). boa Td. 57 Reg.   §  1.587-1(b)(2).

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  of the accumulation is considered in determining the reasonableness of future accumulations.58 The “Business.” The regulations expansively define   the “business” of a corporation. The “business” includes not only the   one in which the corporation   has   previously engaged but also “any line of business which it may undertake.”59 This definition should   provide ample protection for  accumulations intended for expansion into   activities related to the  corporation’s existing businesses, and possibly may permit accumulations to  finance any line of business permitted by the corporation’s charter.® If a  corporation owns and, in effect, operates a subsidiary, the subsidiary’s business may be considered to be the business of the parent for purposes of  evaluating the parent’s reasonable business needs.®! The regulations further  provide that a subsidiary will be considered a “mere   instrumentality” of its parent if the parent owns at least 80 percent of the subsidiary’s voting  stock.62 Below the   80 percent figure, the question of attributing the  subsidiary’ business to the parent is determined   by the particular  circumstances of the case.®  Working   Capital.   The   regulations   recognize   the   need   to   accumulate  earnings   to   provide   “necessary   working   capital   for the   business.”   Working  capital   needs   vary   from   industry   to industry   and   among   enterprises   within the   same   industry,   and   the   courts   have   struggled   to   develop   standards   to  ascertain   the working   capital   requirements   of any   particular   business.®4   The  judiciary’s   efforts   have   evolved   into   the   so-called   Bardahl   formula,   named  for a 1965   Tax   Court   case   which   first employed   the   approach.®   The   formula, which   is   a   mathematician’s   delight,   attempts   to   identify   a   corporation’s  working   capital   needs   by reference   to its “operating   cycle’—a   concept   that  remains   unsettled.66   The   Bardahl   formula   is viewed   as   a   guidepost   rather than   a controlling   legal principle,§?   and   the   following   excerpt   provides   some insight   into   its nature   and   purpose:®  The   formula represents a procedure for arriving at working  capital needs by calculating the requirements of capital funds for  one “operating cycle”  of a business entity. One operating cycle is the  length of time   (usually expressed as  a percentage of a year) it takes to purchase raw   materials   inventory,   process   those raw   materials  58   Td.  59   Reg.   § 1.537—3(a).  60   See   Bittker   &   Eustice,   Federal   Income   Taxation   of Corporations   and   Shareholders  4 7.06  61   Reg.   § 1.537—3(b).  se   SCE   IG 63   Id.  64 See Cunningham, “More   Than   You   Ever Wanted to Know About the Accumulated  Earnings Tax,”   6 J.

Hence, the ultimate   percentage   which   represents   this   cycle must   speak   to  the   turnover   time   of raw   materials,   accounts   receivable,   and   any  credit   cycle.   The   time   it   takes   to   turn   over   inventory   can   be  computed   by dividing   either   the   highest   or   the   average   inventory  for the   year   by the   costs   of the   goods   sold   in that   year.   This   results  in a percentage   of a   year.   In   similar   fashion,   the   time   it takes   to  turn   over   a receivable   account   is computed   by dividing   the   highest  receivables   for the year   by the   sales   for that   year.   This   likewise   is  expressed   as   a   percentage   of   a   year.   Adding   inventory   cycle   to receivables   cycle,   one   arrives   at   a   theoretical   time   period,   again expressed   as   a percentage   of a year,   that   is required   for the   total  productive   process.  The Bardahl International case took   the additional step of  recognizing that those who supply   raw materials and labor are not paid immediately. An appropriate credit period, usually 15 or 30  days, is stated as   a percentage of a year (divided by 365 days per year), and this is subtracted   from the total of the inventory   and receivables percentages. When this ultimate percentage rate is  applied to the net operating expenses for the year, the   result  represents the expenses for one business   operating cycle * * * . To  this   are added   reasonably anticipated extraordinary   expenses during the  tax year in question * * * . The sum represents the total  requirements of the firm for liquid   assets * * * . This is contrasted against the sum of liquid   assets such as cash and   equivalents * * * and   investments   which can   be converted into cash readily if  necessary * * * in order to ascertain whether there is an excess or  shortage of available   capital * * * . Cognizance   must also be taken  of any loans unrelated to the business * * * ,  The result   of this whole process is  a figure * * * indicating how much the   subject   firm has accumulated   beyond its reasonable needs.   This, in conjunction   with its findings on   the   intent of the  parties, should   permit a factfinder to ascertain whether or not   the corporate entity has been availed of for the purpose of avoiding  Income tax by one or more of the shareholders. * *  *  Stock Redemptions.   Corporations sometimes contend that   an accumulation of earnings is necessary to create a fund for a later redemption  of   stock. In response to conflicting   results   in the   courts, Congress has  specifically provided that   the term   “reasonable   needs of the business”  encompasses   accumulations in  the   year of a shareholder’s   death or in any  subsequent year to the  extent   they are necessary to make a stock redemption  to pay   death   taxes under Section 303.69  8   IR.C.   §§  537(a)(2);   537(b)(1).

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  The cases are inconsistent as  to other types of future redemptions. Some  courts have found accumulations to redeem dissenting minority or 50 percent  shareholders to be a reasonable need of the business.”   But corporations have  encountered more difficulty when they have attempted to justify an  accumulation on the ground that reasonable business   needs include  accumulating earnings to redeem either a friendly minority shareholder”! or  a majority shareholder.72 In each case, the question is whether the  redemption satisfies a corporate purpose (e.g., preventing   continuous  deadlocks in the boardroom or, as in one old case, redeeming a shareholder’s voting stock in a newspaper publisher to prevent the   stock from   being sold to special   interests who might disrupt the paper’s editorial policies7’) as  opposed to a shareholder   purpose (e.g., funding a redemption of a retiring  shareholder   under a buy-sell agreement).74 Burden   of Proof.   Sections   533   and   534   work   together   to   provide   an  unusual   procedure   for   regulating   the   burden   of proof   if an   accumulated earnings   tax   controversy   is litigated   in the   Tax   Court.   As   we   have   seen,   an  accumulation   beyond   the   reasonable   needs   of the business   is determinative of   the   forbidden   purpose   unless   the   corporation   proves   otherwise   by   a preponderance   of   the   evidence.?>   The   regulations   provide   that   this presumption   adds   “still more   weight”   to the usual   presumption   of correctness  that   accompanies   the   Service’s   determinations   of   tax   liability.76   The  Commissioner   nonetheless   will   bear   the   burden   of proof on   the   question   of unreasonable   accumulations   unless   it has   informed   the   taxpayer,   prior   to sending   a   formal   notice   of deficiency,   that   the   proposed   notice   includes   an accumulated   earnings   tax   deficiency.77   Even   in   the   likely   case   where   the  Commissioner   provides   notice,   the   taxpayer   can   shift   the   burden   of proof  back   to   the   Commissioner   by   submitting   a   statement   setting   forth   the  grounds   on   which   it relies   to establish   that   all or   part   of its earnings   and  profits   have   not   been   permitted   to accumulate   beyond   the reasonable   needs  of   the   business.78   The   statement   must   be   filed   within   30   days   of   the  Commissioner’s   notification   under   Section   534(b).79   To   shift   the   burden   of  proof, the taxpayer’s   statement   may   not consist   merely   of vague   generalities.  It must   set forth   with   specificity   and   clarity the   grounds   on   which   it will rely  to prove   that   its accumulations   were   reasonable.®  7   See, e.g., Wilcox Manufacturing Co. v.

650   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  4,   CALCULATION   OF ACCUMULATED   TAXABLE   INCOME  Code:   §§ 535(a)—(c);   561;   562(a)—(c);   563(a),   (d); 565(a)—(d),   (f).  The   base   for the   accumulated   earnings   tax   is accumulated   taxable  income,   which   Section   535(a)   defines   as   taxable   income   of   the  corporation,   adjusted   under   Section   535(b),   less the   sum   of the   dividends  paid   deduction   and   the   accumulated   earnings   credit. Adjustments   to   Taxable   Income.   The   base   figure   for   computing accumulated   taxable   income   is the   current   year’s   taxable   income.   The accumulated   earnings   tax, however,   is directed   at real retained   economic  profits   because   they   are   a   more   accurate   measure   of the   corporation’s  capacity   to   pay   dividends.   As   a   result,   taxable   income   is adjusted   in   a manner   somewhat   similar   to   that   used   to   adjust   taxable   income   to determine   earnings   and   profits.   For   example,   to   arrive   at   accumulated  taxable   income,   taxable   income   is   reduced   by   certain   nondeductible taxes®!   and   charitable   contributions   in   excess   of   the   percentage  limitations.82   These   items   do   not   affect   taxable   income   but   nonetheless  result   in   a   decrease   in   the   corporation’s   wealth.   On   the   other   hand, certain   deductions   allowed   for income   tax   purposes   that   do not   currently  reduce   the   corporation’s   real   wealth   are   disallowed   in   computing  accumulated   taxable   income.   These   include   the   dividends   received deduction®?   and   the   net   operating   loss   deduction.84 Section   535(b) contains special   rules governing the treatment of net  capital gains and losses for purposes of determining accumulated taxable income.85   Section 535(b)(6) permits a corporation to reduce   taxable  income   by its net   capital gain for the year less attributable taxes. But for  purposes of determining net   capital gain prior   net   capital   losses are  treated as short-term capital   losses in succeeding taxable years.86 Under Section   535(b)(5)(A) and (B), a corporation can deduct the amount of a net   capital loss reduced   by the lesser   of its “nonrecaptured capital gains  deductions” or   its earnings   and profits as of the close   of the preceding year. “Nonrecaptured capital gains deductions” are generally   defined by Section   535(b)(5)(C) as the   excess of the aggregate amount allowable as  a deduction in prior years for net   capital gains over   the aggregate reductions to capital   losses for prior years. Dividends   Paid   Deduction.   Section   535(a)   logically permits a corporation to reduce accumulated taxable income   by   dividends   paid  during the   taxable year. Section   561(a)   defines   the “dividends   paid” to  81 L.R.C. § 535(b)(1).  & TR.C. § 535(b)(2), 88 1.R.C. § 535(b)(3). 84 LR.C. § 535(b)(4).  8 A separate set   of r  § 535(b)(8). 86 LR.C.   § 535(b)(6), (7).  ules   applies to   a “mere   holding or investment   company.” I.R.C.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  include   dividends8?   paid during the taxable   year and certain “consent  dividends.” Generally, distributions must be pro   rata in order to qualify for the dividends paid deduction.88 Liquidating distributions and  redemptions also may produce a deduction for dividends paid.89 Because  a corporation   frequently may not have the facts available to determine  its lability for the accumulated earnings tax, Section 563(a) provides  that dividends paid on or before the 15th day of the fourth month  following the close   of a taxable   year are considered paid in the earlier year.  Consent   Dividends.   Section   565   permits   shareholders   to   file   a consent   with   the   corporation’s   tax   return   to   include   in   income   as  dividends   amounts   which   were   not in fact distributed.   Consent   dividends  are   treated   as   if they   were   distributed   in cash   to the   shareholders   and then   contributed   back   to   the   corporation   on   the   last   day   of   the corporation’s   taxable   year.9 Accumulated   Earnings   Credit.   To   the   extent   that   a   corporation’s  earnings   are   retained   for the   reasonable   needs   of the   business,   they   are  not   within   the   ambit   of the   accumulated   earnings   tax.   To   remove   these  earnings   from   the grasp   of the tax, a corporation   is permitted   a deduction  for the   accumulated   earnings   credit   in determining   accumulated   taxable income.   The   accumulated   earnings   credit   is   equal   to   the   amount   of  current   earnings   and   profits   (less the   dividends   paid deduction)   retained  for the   reasonable   needs   of the   business   minus   the   deduction   permitted  for net   capital   gains.9!   Section   535(c)(2)   provides   that   the   credit   shall   in no   case   be less than   the   amount   by which   $250,000   ($150,000   in the case of certain   service   corporations)   exceeds   accumulated   earnings   and   profits  at the close of the preceding   taxable   year.   This   has the effect of enabling a   corporation   to   accumulate   a   minimum   of $250,000   regardless   of its business   needs.  PROBLEMS  1. Which of the following accumulations are   likely to be for the reasonable needs of the business?  87 Section   562(a) generally employs the Section   316 definition   of “dividend” for purposes  of determining the dividends   paid   deduction.   Reg. § 1.562-1(a)   provides that if a dividend is  paid in property (other than money) the amount of   the dividends paid   deduction is the  corporation’s   adjusted basis in the   property. The regulation   was   upheld in Fulman v. United  States, 434 U.S.   528,  98 S.Ct. 841 (1978).  ~ 88 T.R.C. § 562(c). Differences in dividend rights among classes   of  stock   not attributable to shareholder   waivers are permitted.  89   T.R.C.   § 562(b)(1). 90   T.R.C.   § 565(c).  91 J.R.C. § 535(c)(1). Net capital   gains are excluded   from accumulated taxable   income   by Section   535(b)(6)   but  they are part  of earnings   and profits.  If a net capital  gain  was not excluded  from   the accumulated   earnings credit it would   reduce   accumulated taxable   income twice:   once under   Section   535(b)(6)   and   again   under   Section   535(c).  22 Accumulated   earnings   and   profits   at   the   close   of the   preceding   year   are reduced   by  dividends   treated   as  paid  in  such   year   under   Section   563(a).   LR.C.   § 535(c)(4).  651

652   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  (a)   Acorporation   retains   $200,000   of earnings   and profits per year for   five   years   to   finance   a   $1,000,000   expansion   of   its manufacturing   plant.   Should   it matter   if the corporation   could  have   borrowed   80%   of the   expansion   costs?  (b)   A   corporation   which   manufactures   computer   chips accumulates   $2,000,000   in order   to acquire   an   office   building  which   is rented   to an   insurance   company   under a net   lease. (c)   Assume   Parent   Corporation   owns   all of the   outstanding   stock  of Brother   and   Sister   Corporations.   Can   Parent   accumulate  earnings   and   profits   for Brother?   Brother   for Parent?   Brother for Sister?   See   Reg.   §§ 1.537—2(c)(3),   —3(b). (d)   A   corporation   accumulates   earnings   and   profits   for potential § 531   tax   liability. (e) A corporation accumulates earnings   and profits   in order to  redeem a class   of limited and preferred stock. 2. T Corporation (a shoe manufacturer) is  a calendar year, accrual method  corporation which is not a personal   holding company and which has accumulated earnings   and profits at the end of year one of $200,000. Tis a closely held corporation   with three shareholders. In year two T has   taxable  income (all of which is ordinary   income) of $60,000. T also has   taxable income  of $60,000 in both years   three and four. There are no distributions to shareholders in any year.  (a) What tax   results to T  under §§ 11 and 531, assuming current § 11 rates   on all income in years two,   three, and four?  (b) What possible defenses may T have to the application of § 531? (c) What effect   will § 534 have on these facts?  D. THE PERSONAL   HOLDING   COMPANY TAX  1. INTRODUCTION  Code:   §§ 541,   542(a).  The   accumulated earnings tax is not   an   entirely effective vehicle to prevent the   use   of a corporation to avoid   the individual tax   rates (when they are higher  than the corporate rates) because it is not imposed unless a corporation   has accumulations that   are motivated at least   in part by  tax avoidance. Moreover, the accumulated earnings credit may shelter  substantial accumulations   from the  Section   531 tax. Partially in response  to these shortcomings   and in order to prevent certain   other   tax avoidance devices, Congress   enacted the personal   holding company tax.93  The original purpose of  the   personal   holding company tax was to  prevent   taxpayers   from   avoiding   the   higher   graduated   individual   tax  rates by   using   devices known as “incorporated   pocketbooks,”  93   H.Rep.   No.   704,   73rd   Cong.,   2d  Sess,   (1934),   reprinted   in 1939-1   C.B.   554,   562.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  eos   .   .  incorporated   talents”   and   “incorporated   properties.”   These   schemes were   structured   as   follows:  (1) Incorporated Pocketbooks. A high bracket individual would  transfer passive investments (e.g., stocks, bonds, rental  property) to   a corporation in exchange for its stock. The  corporation   then could   take advantage of the lower corporate rates and the dividends received deduction for  any   dividends that it received. The   income could be realized  at a later date at capital gain rates through a liquidation of the company or, ideally, the   stock could   be   held until the taxpayer’s   death when his heirs would take a stepped-up basis. (2)   Incorporated   Talents.   A   highly   compensated   individual,  such   as   a   movie   star,   would   form   a   wholly   owned  corporation   and   agree   to work   for the corporation   at a small  salary.   The   corporation   then would   contract   out the services of its owner-employee   for a substantial   sum,   and   the   great  bulk   of the   income   would   be   taxed   at   the   lower   corporate rates.94  (3)   Incorporated   Properties.   A   taxpayer   would   transfer   both investment   property   and   property   which   did   not   generate  income,   such   as   a   yacht   or   home,   to   a   corporation.   The  shareholder   then   would   lease   back   the   property   for   a nominal   amount,   and   the   corporation   would   attempt   to  shelter   both   the   rental   income   and   its   other   income   by  claiming   deductions   for   depreciation   and   maintenance   on the   property.%  To combat these plans,   Section   541 imposes a penalty tax of 20  percent on the “undistributed   personal   holding company income” of every  “personal   holding company.”   The   personal   holding company tax is  imposed in addition to   a corporation’s   regular income tax. To avoid overlap, personal   holding companies are not subject to the accumulated  earnings tax.96 The   remaining sections of  this chapter are limited to an  overview of   the personal   holding company tax, first examining the  definition   of a personal   holding company and   then   turning to the determination of  the tax.  2. DEFINITION OF A PERSONAL   HOLDING   COMPANY  Code: § 542(a). Skim   § 542(c).  A personal   holding company is a corporation   which satisfies a stock  ownership   requirement   and an   adjusted   ordinary gross income test.

654   TAXATION   OF   C   CORPORATIONS   PART   2  corporation   is a   personal   holding   company   is an   objective   inquiry   that  does   not   depend   on   whether   there   is a tax   avoidance   motive.  a.   STOCK   OWNERSHIP   REQUIREMENT  Code:   §§ 542(a)(2);   544. The   first leg of the   definition   of a personal   holding   company   looks   to whether   the corporation   is closely held.   The   stock ownership   requirement in Section   542(a)(2)   is satisfied   if at any   time   during   the   last   half of the  taxable   year   more   than   50   percent   in   value   of   the   corporation’s outstanding   stock   is owned,   directly or indirectly,   by or for not   more   than  five   individuals.   Not   surprisingly,   this   test   is   accompanied   by   special attribution   rules   in   Section   544(a),   under   which   stock   owned   by   a  corporation,   partnership,   estate   or   trust   is   considered   owned proportionately   by   its   shareholders,   partners   or   beneficiaries.97   An  individual   is   considered   to   own   stock   owned   by   his   family   (brothers, sisters,   spouse,   ancestors   and   lineal   descendants)   or   partners,98   as   well  as   stock   held   under   an   option   to purchase.   Section   544(b)(1)   provides  that   securities   convertible   into   stock   are   considered   stock   for purposes   of  Section   542(a)(2)   if the effect of their inclusion   is to make   the corporation  a personal   holding   company.  b.   INCOME   TEST  Code:   §§ 542(a)(1);   543. The   income test seeks to identify corporations   with a significant  amount of passive investment   income or income attributable to the  personal services of a major shareholder. Under Section 542(a)(1), at least 60 percent of a corporation’s “adjusted ordinary gross income” (AOGI)   must be “personal   holding company income” before   the corporation will be classified as   a personal   holding company. To   apply this test, one must   master   some special terminology.  Adjusted   Ordinary Gross   Income. The function of AOGI is  to provide  an accurate measuring rod against which to compare a corporation’s  passive investment   and   personal service income. Its computation begins  with the corporation’s   gross income, which is then reduced   by capital and Section 1231   gains to arrive at ordinary gross income (OGJ).199 These  gains are excluded   from gross income in order to prevent   corporations  from timing  gains   (and inflating  their income) to avoid   the income test, 101  Next, a series   of adjustments   must be made to OGI to determine  AOGI. These   adjustments also   are designed to prevent   easy avoidance of  the income test by manipulation of  the   corporation’s   gross income.   For  97 LR.C. § 544(a)(1). 9 LR.C. § 544(a)(2). 99 LR.C. § 544(a)(3). 100 I.R.C. § 543(b)(1)(A), (B). 101 S.Rep.   No.   830,   88th   Cong.,   2d  Sess.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  example, gross income includes the full amount of receipts from the  rental of property or royalties from   mineral exploration. Absent   some  adjustment mechanism, corporations could generate enough gross  income from   leveraged investments in these properties to inflate AOGI and escape the personal   holding company tax. In order to prevent this technique, AOGI includes not all gross ordinary income but   only the  corporation’s adjusted income from rents and royalties.102 This amount  includes income from rents and mineral, oil and gas   royalties only to the  extent that   the   gross income from these activities exceeds the amount  deductible for depreciation or depletion, property taxes, interest and rent.103 Since copyright royalties, royalties from films produced   by the  corporation and royalties from computer software produced   by the corporation generally require more active participation than   mineral or  oil and gas royalties, the   gross amount of royalties from copyrights,  produced films or qualifying computer software businesses is included in  AOGI.104 Interest earned   by dealers on obligations of the United States  and interest on condemnation awards, judgments and tax refunds also is  excluded   from AOGI.1% Personal   Holding   Company   Income.   The   definition   of   personal  holding   company   income   in Section   543(a)   is subject   to a web   of special  rules   and   exceptions,   making   it   one   of   the   Code’s   most   diabolical provisions.   Before   turning   to   the   details,   a   few   generalizations   are   in  order.   Incorporated   pocketbooks   and   incorporated   talents   were  Congress’s   prime   targets   when   it first enacted   and   expanded   the personal holding   company   tax.   Consistent   with   that   purpose,   passive   investment  income   and   certain   income   from   personal   service   contracts   are   the  principal   components   of   personal   holding   company   income.   But   it is  possible   for rents,   royalties,   and   other   forms   of income   that   appear   to be passive   to result from   a corporation’s   legitimate   active business   pursuits.  Section   543   attempts   to identify   the purely   passive   income   and   the types  of personal   service   income   targeted   by   the   personal   holding   company  provisions   through   the use   of various   mechanical   tests, some   of which   are examined   in more   detail   below. Passive Investment   Income Items:   In   General.   Passive investment  income items are the   principal   target of  the personal   holding company  tax. Personal   holding company income thus   includes   dividends, interest,  annuities,   royalties and rents.!96 Capital   gains and Section   1231   gains are excluded   because   they historically have   enjoyed   preferential rates at  both the   corporate   and individual levels. Dividends are defined by  reference to Section   316   and are   not reduced   by the   dividends   received deduction.   Interest   includes imputed interest under   provisions   such as  Srp   es   Se   ee   SS  102 S.Rep.

The   inclusion   of most   forms of interest   income   may   create   unexpected   difficulties   for   an   otherwise  active   corporation   which   has   sold   a   substantial   portion   of its   assets   on   ©  credit   in   a   year   when   other   receipts   are   minimal.!°7   Royalties   include  income   from   licenses   to   use   various   types   of intangible   property   (e.g.,  patents,   trademarks,   technical   know-how)!   a broad   definition   that   may  threaten   a   high   technology   company,   such   as   a   computer   software manufacturer,   that   chooses   to license   its technology   rather   than   market it   directly.   Royalties   from   natural   resources,   films,   copyrights   and  computer   software   are   treated   separately   and   are   discussed   below.  Rents. One of the major sources of complexity in Section   543 results from its attempt to draw objective lines between passive investment income   and profits from an active operating business. Nowhere is this  better   illustrated than in the   area of  rents. Rents are personal   holding  company income if they constitute less than 50 percent of the  corporation’s total gross income (after certain adjustments).19   The  underlying theory is that where rental income represents the major  activity   of the corporation, that activity is more likely to be of an   active  rather than a passive   character. A special   rule provides, however, that rents still may be characterized as personal   holding company income even when they are 50 percent or more of the corporation’s gross income if, apart from rents, more   than 10 percent of the corporation’s ordinary gross income (capital gains are excluded) is personal   holding company income. 110  Mineral, Oil and   Gas Royalties. Income from mineral, oil and gas royalties also   are singled out for special treatment. The “adjusted income”   from these   royalties constitutes personal   holding company  income unless: (1) such   adjusted income constitutes   50 percent or more  of the corporation’s AOGI, (2) certain   other forms of the corporation’s personal   holding company income do not exceed 10 percent of its OGI,  and (3) the corporation’s   trade or business   deductions,   other than salaries and   deductions specifically allowed by sections   other than Section   162 (e.g., depreciation, interest,   state taxes) exceed 15 percent of AOGI.111 Copyright Royalties. Under rules   similar to those   applicable to  mineral royalties, copyright royalties   are personal   holding company Income unless: (1) they  constitute   50 percent or more of  the  corporation’s  OGI, (2) other   personal   holding company   income after certain  adjustments, does   not exceed 10 percent of  the  corporation’s OGI,   and (3)  107   See, e.g., O'Sullivan Rubber Co. v. Commissioner, 120   F.2d   845   (2d Cir.1941),  108 Reg. § 1.543-1(b)(3). 109 LR.C. § 543(a)(2)(A),  110 I.R.C. § 543(a)(2)(B).   For   purposes of  this   10   percent test, personal   h  income is reduced   by  dividends   paid or deemed paid for  the  taxable   year. Id. 11   T.R.C. § 548(a)(3).  olding   company

Computer   Software   Royalties.   At   one   time,   a closely   held   company that   manufactured   computer   software   was   confronted   with   the   personal holding   company   tax   if it licensed   its technology   instead   of marketing   it  directly.114   Despite   the   fact   that   the   company   was   an   active   operating  business,   the   payments   received   under   the   licensing   agreements   likely constituted   personal   holding   company   income   under   Section   5438, which  includes   both   “royalties”   and   certain   “copyright   royalties”   in   the definition   of personal   holding   company   income.!15   Congress   responded   to this   problem   by   providing   that   computer   software   royalties   do   not constitute   personal   holding   company   income   if they   are   “active   business  computer   software   royalties.”116   That   term   is defined   in Section   543(d)(1)  as   royalties,   received   by a corporation   in connection   with   the licensing   of  computer   software,   which   satisfy   four   requirements   that   generally   are  designed   to   restrict   the   exception   to corporations   earning   a   substantial  portion   of their   income   and   incurring   significant   expenses   in the   active conduct   of   the   trade   or   business   of   developing,   manufacturing,   or producing   computer   software.!17  Personal   Service   Income.   The   final   major   category   of   personal  holding   company   income   is aimed   at the incorporated   talent.   Income   from contracts   to furnish   personal   services,   including   income   from   the   sale   or other   disposition   of such   contracts,   is tainted   if: (1) the   individual   who   is to   perform   the   services   is   designated   by   name   or   description   in   the contract   or can   be designated   by some   person   other   than   the corporation, and   (2) the   designated   individual   owns   (directly   or   through   attribution)  25   percent   or   more   of the   value   of the   corporation’s   stock   at   any   time  during   the   year.118  Other Items.

Bull.   169.  Advice   has   been   requested   whether,   under   the   circumstances  described   below,   a   corporation   will   be   considered   to   have   received  personal   holding company   income   within   the meaning   of section   543(a)(7) of the Internal   Revenue   Code   of 1954. B, a doctor   specializing   in a certain   area   of medical   services,   owns   80 percent   of the   outstanding   stock   of L,   a   domestic   professional   service  corporation.   B is the   only   officer   of L who   is active   in the   production   of income   for L, and   he is the   only medical   doctor   presently   employed   by L.  B   performs   medical   services   under   an   employment   contract   with   L.   L furnishes   office   quarters   and   equipment,   and   employs   a receptionist   to  assist   B. P, a patient,   solicited   the   services   of and   was   treated   by B.  Section 543(a)(7) of the Code provides, in   part, that   the term personal   holding company income includes amounts received under a  contract whereby a corporation is to furnish personal services if some  person other than the corporation   has the   right to designate, by name or  description,   the individual who is   to perform the services, or   if the  individual who is to perform the   services is designated, by name or  description, in the   contract.  In dealing   with a professional service corporation   providing   medical  services, an individual will customarily solicit and expect to receive   the services of a particular   physician, and he will usually be   treated by the  physician sought.  A physician-patient   relationship arises from   such a general  agreement of treatment.   Either   party may terminate the relationship at  will, although the physician must give   the patient reasonable notice of  his withdrawal   and may not abandon the patient until a replacement, if  necessary,   can   be   obtained. C. Morris & A. Moritz, Doctor   and   Patient  and the Law 135   (5th ed. 197 1). Moreover, if  a physician who has   entered  into a general agreement of treatment is unable to treat the  patient when his services are needed,   he may provide a qualified and competent substitute   physician to render the  services.   C. Morris & A.  Moritz,   supra,  at 138, 374-75.  Thus, when an individual solicits, and expects,   the   services   of a  particular   physician   and that physician   accepts   the   individual as   a  patient and treats him,   the   relationship of physician-patient   established  in this manner does   not  constitute a designation of  the  individual who is 119 T.R.C. § 543(a)(6).  120 LR.C.   § 543(a)(8).

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES 659  to perform the   services under a contract for personal services within the  meaning of section   543(a)(7) of the Code.  If, however, the physician or the professional service corporation  contracts with the patient that   the physician   personally will perform particular services for the   patient, and he   has no right to substitute  another physician to perform such services, there is  a designation of that physician as the individual to perform services under a contract for  personal services within the meaning of section   543(a)(7) of the Code.  The   designation   of a physician   as   an   individual   to perform   services  can   be   accomplished   by either   an   oral   or   written   contract.   See   Rev.Rul.  69-299,   1969-1   C.B.   165.  Moreover,   if L   agreed   to   perform   the   type   of services   that   are   so  unique   as   to preclude   substitution   of another   physician   to perform   such  services,   there   is also   a designation.  Accordingly,   since   in the   instant   case   there   is no   indication   that   L  has   contracted   that   B   will   personally   perform   the   services   or   that   the  services   are   so   unique   as   to preclude   substitution,   it is held   that   income  earned   by   L   from   providing   medical   service   contracts   will   not   be considered   income   from   personal   service   contracts   within   the meaning   of  section   543(a)(7)   of the   Code.  3.   TAXATION   OF   PERSONAL   HOLDING   COMPANIES  Code:   §§ 541;   545(a). Personal   holding   companies   are   subject   to a tax of 20 percent   of their undistributed   personal   holding   company   income.!21   The   key   to  understanding   the   computation   of the   personal   holding   company   tax   is  the   concept   of undistributed   personal   holding   company   income   (UPHCI).  The   definition   of   UPHCI   bears   no   relationship   to   the   definition   of  personal   holding   company   income.   As   defined   in Section   545(a),   UPHCI  is   essentially   the   corporation’s   after-tax   profits   less   a   dividends   paid  deduction.  a. ADJUSTMENTS TO TAXABLE   INCOME  Code:   § 545(b). The   personal   holding company tax is imposed on   the   corporation’s real   after-tax   profits rather   than its taxable   income.   Accordingly, in  determining the   tax   base,   certain adjustments are made to the  Corporation’s   taxable   income so that it more   nearly   resembles the  corporation’s   true economic   income.   Deductions are allowed for payments,   such as federal   taxes!”   and certain   excess   charitable  contributions,   which   reduce   the   corporation’s   real wealth   but are   not  1 ine  stoi fe   ce 121 -T.R.C. § 541. 122 T.R.C. § 545(b)(1).

An   example   is the   Section   243   dividends   received  deduction.124   Net   operating   losses   also   receive   special   treatment.}25   ~ Finally,   in   order   to   exempt   long-term   capital   gains   from   the   personal holding   company   tax,   corporations   may   eliminate   net   capital   gains   less attributable   taxes   in determining   UPHCI.!26 Another   Section   545(b)   adjustment   relates   to a specific tax avoidance scheme   mentioned   earlier.   Individuals   cannot   depreciate   their   homes, yachts,   vacation   homes   or   other   property   held   for personal   use.   In order to obtain   the   benefits   of depreciation,   individuals   would   transfer   these  assets   to a corporation   with   other   income   and   then   lease   them   back   in an  attempt   to convert   the   assets   to income-producing   status   in the   hands   of  the   corporation.   We   have   already   seen   that   the   resulting   rental   income will likely be personal   holding   company   income.   Section   545(b)(6)   attacks  this   same   scheme   from   a   different   angle.   For   purposes   of determining UPHCTI,   if the corporation   leases   its property,   the   allocable   business   and depreciation   deductions   are   limited   to   the   rental   income   from   the  property   unless   the   corporation   can   establish   that:   (1) the   rent   received  for the property   was   the highest   obtainable,   (2) the property   was   held   by  the   corporation   in the   course   of a business   for profit,   and   (3) there   either  was   a reasonable   expectation   of profit   from   the   property   or   the   property was   necessary   to the conduct   of the business.  b. DIVIDENDS PAID DEDUCTION  Code:   §§ 561;   316(b);   562(a)—(c); 563-565. Skim   § 547. The   purpose of the personal   holding company tax is  to force personal  holding companies to distribute earnings to their individual shareholders. It follows   that to the extent a personal   holding company  distributes its earnings, the   Section   541 tax should not apply. To qualify  for the dividends   paid   deduction,   distributions generally must be pro rata.!27 Under Section 561(a),   the dividends   paid deduction   equals the sum of the dividends   paid during the taxable year, consent   dividends,  and the dividend   carryover under Section 564. The   combination of these provisions make it highly   unlikely   that any well informed   personal  holding company ever will be  subject to the penalty tax.  Dividends  Paid During the   Year.

CHAPTER 14 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES  that a dividend in kind of appreciated property may only be deducted to  the extent of the corporation’s basis in the distributed property.128 This rule is at variance with the treatment of such   dividends to shareholders, for whom the “amount” of the distribution is the full fair market value of the distributed property under Section 301(b)(1)(A). But the regulation was upheld   by the Supreme Court on the general ground that T'reasury  Regulations should be sustained by the   courts whenever they have a  “reasonable basis.”129 Query whether the same   approach should be used for distributions of property that has   declined in value? Distributions   and   redemptions   treated   as   Section   301   distributions  are,   of course,   taxable   as   dividends   to   the   shareholders   to   the   extent   of  the   corporation’s   available   earnings   and   profits.   If a   corporation   is   a personal   holding   company,   however,   distributions   may   be   taxed   as dividends   even   if there   are   no   available   earnings   and   profits.   Under  Section   316(b)(2),   if a personal   holding   company   makes   distributions   in  excess   of   the   available   earnings   and   profits,   the   distributions   are nonetheless   treated   as   dividends   for   all   purposes   to   the   extent   of the corporation’s   UPHCI.   This   rule   also applies   if a corporation   is considered to   make   a   distribution   under   Section   563(b)   (dividends   paid   after   the year)   or   Section   547   (deficiency   dividends)   in   a   year   in   which   it is   a personal   holding   company.  Section   563(b)   Election.   If a corporation   elects   under   Section   563(b),  dividends   paid   or   on   before   the   15th   day   of the   fourth   month   following the   close   of a taxable   year   will be treated   as having   been   paid during   the  prior   year.   The   amount   allowed   as   a   dividend   under   Section   563(b)  cannot   exceed   either   the   corporation’s   UPHCI   for the   prior   taxable   year  or   20 percent   of the   actual   dividends   paid   during   the   prior year.13° Consent   Dividends. If   a corporation does not make actual  distributions during the relevant period, it still can   qualify for a  dividends   paid   deduction to the extent   that its shareholders   consent to  be taxed as   if they had received pro   rata distributions during the   year  and   had   immediately   made capital contributions of the same amount.131  Consent dividends are deductible   only to the extent   that all the  shareholders   consent to be taxed on a pro   rata   basis!8? and only to the  extent   that   actual   distributions would be  dividends   under Section   316(a) or 316(b). Dividend Carryover. Even if a corporation   pays no actual or consent  dividends, it  is entitled to   a current   dividend   deduction if  it has   paid  sufficient dividends in  either or both of  the   two   preceding years. Under Section   564   the amount of  this deduction is the   greater of  the   excess   of the   dividends   paid   deduction   (without   carryovers)   over   taxable   income,  i a  128   Reg.   § 1.562—1(a).  1229 Fulman v. United States, 4384 U.S.   528,   98   S.Ct.   841   (1978).  130 The   timing of  the   shareholder's   income is not   affected by the   Section   563(b)   election. 131 T.R.C. § 565(c). 182   T.R.C.   § 565(b)(1).  661

662   TAXATION   OF   C CORPORATIONS   PART   2  as   adjusted   in Section   545,   for   the   preceding   year,   or   the   excess   of the combined   dividends   paid   deduction   (without   carryovers)   for   the  preceding   two   years   over   the   total   taxable   income   (again   adjusted   under  Section   545) for the same   two   years.   Roughly   translated,   this means   that  a corporation   that   over   distributes   in prior   years   may   distribute   less   in the current   year   in determining   its exposure   to the   tax. Liquidating   Distributions.   If a corporation   is liquidating,   it still may be   a   personal   holding   company.   Indeed,   an   operating   company   may become   a personal   holding   company   during   the   process   of liquidating   if it ceases   its   operations   in   a   taxable   year   prior   to   its   final   liquidating distribution   and   has   only   passive   investment   income   in   that   terminal year.   In   order   to   avoid   penalizing   liquidating   corporations   by   denying them   a   dividends   paid   deduction   for   actual   liquidating   distributions,  Section   562(b)(2)   provides   that   if the   corporation   liquidates   within   24  months   of adopting   a   plan   of liquidation,   liquidating   distributions   to corporate   shareholders   are   treated   as   dividends   for   purposes   of   the  dividends   paid deduction   to the   extent   of the   shareholder’s   proportionate  share   of UPHCI   for   the   year   of the   distribution.   At   the   corporation’s  election,   liquidating   distributions   to noncorporate   shareholders   also   may  be   treated   as   dividends   under   Section   316(b)(2)(B)   to   the   extent   of the  shareholders’   proportionate   share   of UPHCI.   If they   are   so   treated,   the corporation   is   entitled   to   take   the   dividends   paid   deduction.   Unlike  corporate   shareholders,   however,   noncorporate   shareholders   must   treat  such   liquidating   distributions   as   dividend   income   under   Section   316(b) rather   than   capital   gain   under   Section   331. Deficiency Dividends. If a corporation is determined to be a personal holding company for a_ particular year, Section   547 permits the  corporation to reduce its personal   holding company tax base (but   not  interest or penalties) by the amount of its “deficiency   dividends.” Deficiency   dividends are defined as amounts paid   within 90 days of the determination of personal   holding company tax liability which   would  have   been eligible for the dividends   paid deduction if distributed in the  year in which Section   541 tax hability exists.133 A deficiency dividend is  allowed as of the date a claim for dividend is  filed.134  PROBLEMS  Le x Corporation is wholly owned   by A. Determine   whether X is a personal holding company under each of the  following   alternatives:  (a) X   manufactures umbrellas. In   year one, X has   $2,000,000 gross   receipts from sales, and its cost   of goods sold is $800,000.  It has no  other income or expenses   and makes no   distributions.  183 T.R.C. § 547(d)(1).  4 LR.C.   § 547(b)(1).

Dr.   K   contracts   to   work   for   the corporation   for   $150,000   per   year.

During   the   year,   the   theater   has receipts   of   $300,000   and   deductible   expenses   (depreciation  interest,   salaries   and   film   rents)   of $800,000?  (c)   Attorney   forms   Professional   Corporation   and   incorporates   his  private   practice.   During   the   year   the   corporation   earns   fees   of $300,000   and   pays   Attorney   a salary   of $150,000.  (d)   Aside   from   the   personal   holding   company   tax,   what   other  challenges   might   the   Service   assert   in parts   (a)—(c)? 3.   Iris   Securities   Company   is   wholly   owned   by   Investor.   Determine  whether   Iris is a personal   holding   company,   and if so, the amount   of the § 541 tax,   under   the   following   circumstances: (a) Iris earns a total   of $30,000 of interest and dividends in year  one. Iris also owns an apartment complex. During the past  year, it collected   rents of $100,000. Iris’s only deductions   were depreciation of $35,000, mortgage interest of $30,000, and  property taxes of $5,000. Iris makes no distributions during the year.  (b) Assume that Investor comes to you for tax advice on December  15  of year one.   If  Iris uses   the calendar year as its taxable year,  can it avoid   personal   holding company status? What if Investor comes to you in January of year   two? 4. Operating Company is owned equally by Ms.   Active and   by   X Corporation.   Operating Company has   been   engaged in   the retail   sales business.   In June of  year one, Operating Company adopts a plan to liquidate.  In December of  year one, it  sells  all  its assets for $1,000,000,   which it deposits  in a short-term   savings   account.   In June of  year   two,   after having   earned $50,000   interest   during   the   year, Operating   Company liquidates   by distributing   $525,000 to each   shareholder.   To   simplify   the   facts, disregard  the federal   tax   Operating   Company   owes   on   the   $50,000   of  interest   income.

CHAPTER   15  S CORPORATIONS*  A.   INTRODUCTION  We   have   seen   that   a   C corporation’s   net   income   is taxable   at a flat  rate   of 21   percent,!   and   those   earnings   are   taxed   again   when   distributed  as   dividends   to noncorporate   shareholders.?   Although   many   techniques  have   been   devised   to   avoid   the   impact   of the   double   tax   regime,   that  framework   nonetheless   remains   the   principal   feature   distinguishing   the taxation   of incorporated   and   unincorporated   businesses.   In comparison,  partnerships   and   limited   liability companies   are   treated   for tax purposes  as   conduits   whose   income   and   deductions   pass   through   to the   partners  or   members   as   they   are   realized,   with   the   various   items   retaining   their original   character   in the process.?   Because   income   is taxed   at the partner level,   partnership   distributions   of cash   and   property   generally   do   not produce   any   additional   tax   liability.4 In the   early   days   of our   tax   history,   taxpayers   sought   to obtain   the  state   law   benefits   of the   corporate   form   (limited   liability,   centralized  management,   etc.) without   having   to endure   the   sting   of the   double   tax. Congress   attempted   to accommodate   this   desire   over   60 years   ago   when  it   enacted   Subchapter   S,   which   allows   the   shareholders   of   a   “small business   corporation”   to   elect   to   avoid   a   corporate   level   tax   in   most situations.   The   stated   purpose   of Subchapter   S was   to permit   a business  to select its legal form   “without   the necessity   of taking into account   major differences   in tax   consequence.”> As originally adopted, Subchapter S   was a modified   corporate  scheme of taxation   rather than a partnership-like pass-through regime. This   early   version was a strange   hybrid of corporate and   partnership concepts,   laden   with   complexity. In   these formative years,   an   electing small   business   necessarily depended on   skilled lawyers   and   accountants to avoid Subchapter S’s many technical traps.   Calls for reform began with  a 1969 Treasury Department study, which in general   proposed a  liberalization of  the eligibility requirements   and the adoption of a conduit  * See   generally Eustice, Kuntz, & Bogdanski,   Federal   Income   Taxation of Subchapter   S  Corporations.  ie   Tilia Os,Sp alae 2   LR.C.   §§ 61(a)(7),   301.  3 T.R.C. § 702(a), (b).

668   TAXATION   OF   S CORPORATIONS   PART   3  approach   more   closely   conforming   to the   tax   treatment   of partnerships.® Congress   gradually   relaxed   the   eligibility   requirements   through piecemeal   legislation,   most   notably   the   Subchapter   S   Revision   Act   of 1982.7   The   1982   Act   greatly   reduced   the   tax   disparities   between  Subchapter   S corporations   and   partnerships   by replacing   the   modified   |  corporate   structure   of Subchapter   S with   a   statutory   scheme   which   is similar   but   not   identical   to   the   tax   treatment   of   partnerships   and  partners   under   Subchapter   K. That   Act   also   introduced   the   terminology  now   used   in the   Code.   Electing   small   business   corporations   are   called   “S corporations”   while   other   corporations   are   known   as   “C corporations.”8  Subsequent   legislation   further   liberalized   the   Subchapter   S  eligibility   requirements   and   eliminated   technical   traps   for corporations  seeking   to elect   and   maintain   S corporation   status.   As   a result   of these  reforms,   the   tax   differences   between   partnerships   and   S   corporations  have   narrowed,   making   operation   as   an   S   corporation   a   viable,   albeit  much   less   flexible,   alternative   for   some   closely   held   businesses.   But  significant   differences   in tax   treatment   remain   between   S corporations  and   unincorporated   businesses.   Subchapter S status   is available   only for corporations   that   satisfy   the   statutory   definition   of   “small   business  corporation”   in   Section   1361(b).   This   definition   restricts   eligibility   to corporations   with   100   or   fewer   shareholders;   prohibits   more   than   one  class of stock;   and   limits   the types   of permissible   shareholders.   Moreover,  partners’   bases   in their partnership   interests   are increased   by their   share of partnership   liabilities,9   while   debts   incurred   by   an   S corporation   to  outsiders   have   no   effect   on   the   bases   of the   corporation’s   shareholders   in their   stock.   This   difference   may   have   an   impact   upon   the   ability   of  investors   to utilize   losses   generated   by the   enterprise   and   the   treatment  of distributions.!0   Subchapter   K   also   offers   partners   more   flexibility   in  determining   their   individual   tax   results   from   partnership   operations. Partnership   allocations   of   specific   items   of   income   or   deduction   to   a particular   partner   will   be   respected   as   long   as   the   allocation   has  substantial   economic   effect,   while   shareholders   of an   § corporation   are  required   to report   a pro   rata   share   of each   corporate   item.! A pass-through tax regime for corporate entities is most attractive when the individual tax   rates are   on a relative par with   corporate tax rates. For a brief time in the late 1980s,   the top individual marginal rate  fell below the maximum rate for C corporations,   influencing many closely held businesses   requiring the corporate   form   and able to meet the  . 6 ee U.S. Treasury   Department, Technical   Explanation of Treasury   Tax   Reform  roposals:   Hearings Before   the House Comm. on Ways and Means, 91st Cong..   1 =  5275 (April  22,  1969), ae  (Buby lin Now   o72on4.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  eligibility requirements to operate as S corporations. The current tax  landscape,   however, is markedly different. The   Tax Cuts and Jobs   Act  significantly reduced the maximum corporate rate from 35 percent to the  current 21 percent flat rate. This rate reduction far outpaced the   decline in the highest individual tax   rates from 39.6 percent to 37   percent. As a result, the prospect of conducting a business through a C corporation and  retaining earnings to be taxed at lower rates has once again   gained  traction and may   make the S corporation alternative less attractive in some situations. It   was   once   thought   that   the   emergence   of   the   limited   liability  company,   with   its   far   greater   flexibility,   and   the   ease   of   electing  partnership   status   for   tax   purposes   under   the _ check-the-box  classification   regulations,   threatened   to   send   S   corporations   to   the sidelines.   Despite   these   developments   and   the   reduction   of the   corporate  income   tax   rate,   it would   be   premature   to   predict   the   demise   of the   S corporation.   Many   existing   S corporations   remain   on   the   scene   and   the Subchapter   S   corporation   tax   regime   and   governance   structure   are relatively   simple   and   familiar.   In fact,   S corporations   became   the   most common   corporate   entity   type   in   1997   and,   for taxable   years   ending   in  2018,   the   latest   for   which   data   is   available,   70.6   percent   of   all  corporations   filing   tax   returns   were   S   corporations.!2   In   2018,   the  number   of   S   corporation   returns   (5,128,058)   exceeded   the   number   of partnership   returns   (4,239,198).!8   Thus,   because   S corporations   continue  to   be   an   option   for   many   operating   businesses,   a   study   of   the  fundamentals   of   Subchapter   S   is   essential   for   a   comprehensive  understanding   of business   enterprise   taxation.   It also   is instructive   to compare   the   provisions   of Subchapters   S and   K and   to consider   which   of  these   pass-through   taxation   models   is   preferable   from   a_   policy  standpoint.!4  B. ELIGIBILITY   FOR   S CORPORATION STATUS  Code:   § 1361.  Eligibility to make a Subchapter S election is limited to   a “small business corporation,”   defined in Section   1361(b) as   a domestic  corporation!® which is not   an   “ineligible corporation”   and   which has: (1)  no more   than 100   shareholders, (2) only shareholders who are  individuals, estates, and certain   types of   trusts and   tax-exempt organizations, (3) no nonresident alien shareholders,   and (4) not more  than one class   of  stock. The   100-shareholder limit   disqualifies   publicly  traded   corporations   from S status, and the   one-class-of-stock rule   shuts  12 See   Internal Revenue Service Data   Book,   2018,   Table 3.  13   Td.  14 See   Section H of  this chapter, infra. 15 LR.C.   § 1361(b)(1).

Significantly, however,   there   is no   cap   on   the income   or asset   value   of a “small   business corporation.”   Although   most   S   corporations   conduct   relatively   small businesses   and   many   have   only   one   shareholder,   some   very   large enterprises   operate   as   S   corporations,   including   a   few   with   assets  exceeding   $100   million.16  Some   remaining   aspects   of the S corporation   eligibility requirements are   summarized   below. Ineligible-Corporations   and   Subsidiaries.   An   “ineligible   corporation”  may   not   qualify   as   a   “small   business   corporation.”!7   Certain   types   of  corporations,   such   as   banks   and   insurance   companies,   are   “ineligible” because   they   are   governed   by   other   specialized   tax   regimes.18   At   one  time, any corporation   that was   a member   of an   “affiliated   group”   also was ineligible   to   be   an   S   corporation—a   rule   that   effectively   precluded   S corporations   from   owning   80 percent   or more   of the   stock   of another   C or  S corporation.19   Under   current   law,   S corporations   may   hold   subsidiaries under   certain   conditions.   C   corporation   subsidiaries   generally   are  permitted,20   and   a   parent-subsidiary   relationship   between   two   S  corporations   also is allowed   if the   parent   elects   to treat   its offspring   asa  “qualified   subchapter   S subsidiary”   (“QSSS”),   which   generally   is defined  as   a   100   percent   owned   domestic   corporation   that   is not   an   “ineligible  corporation”   and   otherwise   would   qualify   for   S status   if all   of its   stock  were   held   by the   shareholders   of its   parent.2!   If this   QSSS   election   is  made,   the subsidiary   is disregarded   for tax purposes,   and   all of its assets,  habilities,   income,   deductions,   and   credits   are   treated   as   belonging   to its  S   parent.22   The   regulations   provide   detailed   procedures   to   govern  revocation   and   other   terminations   of a   QSSS   election.   In   general,   they  treat   a terminating   event   as   a deemed   incorporation   of a new   subsidiary  that   is governed   by general   tax   principles.?3  Number of  Shareholders. Congress has made S  corporations more widely available by gradually   increasing the number of permissible shareholders. The current 100-shareholder limit24 is nearly triple an earlier 35-shareholder cap. For purposes of  this   limit, a married couple (and their   estates) are counted as one shareholder   regardless of  their  SA: See, e.g., IRS Statistics   of Income Integrated   Business   Data (Table 1: Selected  Financial Data on Businesses: 1980-2012).  17   LR.C.   § 1861(b)(1). 18   L.R.C.   § 1361(b)(2). 9 LR.C. § 1361(b)(2)(A)   (pre-1997).  20 The   S parent, however, may not join i 1 1 1  LR.C,  § 1504(b)(6).

If  a subsidiary   was in existence   and  had a prior   tax history,   the QSSS election   triggers a deemed liquidation   of  the  subsidiary   under Sections   332   and   337 as  of  the day  before   the election is  effective.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  form of ownership.?5 If stock is jointly owned (e.g., as tenants in common or joint tenants) by other than a husband and wife, each joint owner is  considered a separate shareholder.?6 In the case   of a nominee, guardian, custodian, or agent   holding stock in a representative capacity,   the  beneficial owners of the   stock are counted toward the 100-shareholder  limit.27  In   addition   to   the   special   rule   for   spouses,   all   the   members   of a  “family”   (and   their   estates)   are   treated   as   a   single   shareholder   for purposes   of the   100-shareholder   limit.28   A family   is defined   as   the   lineal  descendants   (and   their   spouses   and   former   spouses)   of   a   common  ancestor   who   is no   more   than   six generations   removed   from   the youngest  generation   shareholder   as   of the later   of the   date   the   S election   is made,  the   earliest   date   that   a family   member   holds   stock   in the corporation,   or  October   22, 2004.29  Eligible   Shareholders.   Congress   also   has   gradually   expanded   the  eligible   S corporation   shareholder   pool.   Once   limited   to individuals   who  were   U.S.   citizens   or resident   aliens,   the permissible   shareholder   list now  also   includes   decedent’s   and   bankruptcy   estates,2°   certain   types   of trusts  discussed   in more   detail   below,?!   qualified   pension   trusts,   and   charitable organizations   that   are   exempt   from   tax   under   Section   501(c)(3).32   A corporation   still may   not   make   an S election   if any   of its shareholders   are C corporations,   partnerships,   ineligible   trusts,   or nonresident   aliens.%8  When   Subchapter   S   was   first   enacted,   trusts   were   not   eligible  shareholders,   primarily   because   of   Congress’s   desire   for   a   relatively  simple   one-tier   corporate   tax   regime   where   all beneficial   owners   were clearly identifiable.   In response   to the pleas of tax advisors   to closely held  businesses,   Congress   gradually   relented   by   permitting   various   widely  used   types   of trusts   to be S corporation   shareholders   if certain   conditions  are   met.   Under   current   law, the trusts   that   are   permissible   shareholders  include:  (1) Voting trusts,   in which case each beneficial owner is treated  as   a separate   shareholder;34  25   T.R.C.   § 1361(c)(1)(A)();   Reg.   § 1.1361-1(e)(2).  2   Reg. § 1.1361—1(e)(1).  27   Td.  28 LR.C. § 1361(c)(1)(A)Gi).   Ifa married couple is part of a family they are counted as part of a family. I.R.C. § 1361(c)(1)(B)(). 29 J.R.C. § 1361(c)(1)(B). Adopted children and foster children are treated as children by  blood. I.R.C. § 1361(c)(1)(C). A spouse is considered to be of   the same   generation as the individual to whom the spouse is married. I.R.C. § 1361(c)(1)(B) (a).  30   T.R.C.   § 1361(b)(1)(B),   (€)(3).  31. See infra   text accompanying notes   34—49. 32 T.R.C. §§  1361(b)(1)(B), (c)(6). The trade-off for tax-exempt   pension   trusts   and   Section 501(c)(3) organizations is that   their   interest   in  the S  corporation is treated as an   interest in an “unrelated   trade or business,”   and   any   net income is generally   taxable at  the  trust or corporate rates.

672   TAXATION   OF   S CORPORATIONS   PART   3  (2)   Grantor   trusts—i.e.,   domestic   trusts   treated   for   tax  purposes   as   owned   by their   grantor—provided   the   grantor is   an   individual   who   is   a   U.S.   citizen   or   resident.35   An  example   would   be the commonly   used   revocable   living trust  created   to   provide   for   continuity   of asset   management   in the   event   of the   grantor’s   disability   and   to   avoid   probate administration   on   death.   For   purposes   of   the   100-  shareholder   limit,   the   deemed   owner   of the   trust   is treated  as   the   shareholder.%6 (3)   Former   grantor   trusts   that   continue   as   testamentary trusts,   but   only   for   the   two-year   period   following   the  grantor’s   death.37   The   former   deemed   owner’s   estate   is  treated   as   the   S corporation   shareholder.38  (4) Testamentary trusts that   receive S corporation stock under  the terms of a will, but again only for the two-year period after the date of transfer of the   stock to the trust.39 The  testator’s estate continues to be  treated as the S  corporation  shareholder.4° (5) Qualified Subchapter S trusts “(QSSTs”), defined generally  as trusts all of the income of which is actually   distributed  or must be  distributed currently to one individual who is  a U.S. citizen or resident.41   A QSST may only have one current income beneficiary, who must elect QSST status and, as a result, is treated as the owner for tax purposes of  the portion of the trust consisting of the S corporation stock with   respect to which the election was made.#42 Among other things,   the QSST definition permits a Qualified Terminable Interest Property (“QTIP”) Trust,43   the most   widely   used type of estate   tax marital deduction trust created for the benefit of a surviving spouse, to hold S$ corporation stock.  (6) Electing   small business trusts (“ESBTs”), a statutory  creation   that   potentially expands the usefulness of S  corporations in estate planning for a family   business. All  the  beneficiaries of  an ESBT must be  individuals or estates  who are   eligible S   corporation   shareholders,   nonresident  aliens, or charitable   organizations   holding   contingent  *  35  I.R.C. § 1361(c)(2)(A)(i).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS   673  remainder interests.44 The beneficial   interests in an ESBT  must have been   acquired by gift or bequest, not purchase, 45  and the trust must elect ESBT status to qualify as an S  corporation shareholder.46 Each potential current  beneficiary of the trust is treated as a shareholder for purposes of the 100-shareholder limit,47 but the trust’s pro  rata share of S corporation income is taxable to the trust at  the highest individual marginal rates under rules specially  designed for this purpose.48 The significance of the ESBT  category is that it permits inter vivos and testamentary  trusts with more than one beneficiary—e.g., a “sprinkling”  trust where the  trustee has discretion to determine whether and how much income or corpus to distribute among several beneficiaries—to qualify as an S corporation   shareholder.  The   regulation   treating   a   family   as   one   shareholder   for   the   100-  shareholder   limit   explains   that   the   rule   applies   to family   members   who  own   stock   directly   as   well   as   those   who   are   shareholders   because   they are   beneficiaries   of   a QSST   or   ESBT.49  One-Class-of-Stock   Requirement.   An   S corporation   may   issue   both  stock   and   debt,   but   it may   not   have   more   than   one   class   of stock.59   The  purpose   of this   rule   is to simplify   the   allocation   of income   and   deductions  among   an   S corporation’s   shareholders   and   prevent   “special   allocations”  and   their   potential   for   income   shifting.   The   one-class-of-stock  requirement   has   spawned   many   controversies   over   its history,   but   the issuance   of final   regulations   has   resolved   the   most   contentious   issues. An S corporation   generally   is treated   as   having   one   class   of stock   if  all of its outstanding   shares   confer   identical   rights   to distributions   and  liquidation   proceeds.5!   Significantly,   differences   in voting   rights   among classes   of common   stock   are   disregarded,   permitting   an   S corporation   to issue both   voting   and   nonvoting   common   stock.5?   In determining   whether  outstanding   stock   confers   identical   rights   to distribution   and   liquidation  proceeds,   the   regulations   look   to   the   corporate   charter,   articles   of  44 L.R.C. § 1361(e)(1)(A)(), (c)(2)(B)(v). Charitable remainder trusts, however, may not be S corporation   shareholders. I.R.C. § 1361(e)(1)(B)Gii). See also Rey. Rul. 92-48, 1992-1 C.B.  301.  45   T.R.C.   § 1361(e)(1)(A)Q@)).  46 T.R.C. § 1361(e)(1)(A)(iii). Trusts that already   have made a QSST election or are wholly exempt from tax do  not   qualify as ESBTs. I.R.C. § 1361(e)(1)(B).  47 T.R.C. § 1361(c)(2)(B)(v). If there are   no potential   current income beneficiaries, then the  trust is treated as the shareholder for that   period.

Agreements   that provide   for a purchase   or redemption   of stock  at   book   value   or   at   a   price   between   book   value   and   fair   market   value satisfy   the   purchase   price   standard.57  Unless the straight   debt safe harbor applies,58 any instrument,  obligation or arrangement issued by a corporation (other than outstanding stock) is treated as   a second class   of stock if: (1) it constitutes equity under general tax  principles, and (2) a principal purpose of issuing  or entering into the instrument, obligation or arrangement is   to circumvent the distribution and liquidation rights of outstanding shares or the limitation on   eligible shareholders.59 Safe harbors   from reclassification are provided for short-term unwritten   advances to the  corporation that   do   not exceed   $10,000   and obligations   held  proportionately among the shareholders.6° The existence of various corporate instruments that   give holders the   right to acquire stock (e.g.,  call options or warrants) also may create a second class   of stock  53   Reg.   § 1.1861—1()(2)(i). 54   Reg.   § 1.1861—1(0)(2)(i).  55 Reg. § 1.1361-1()(2)(vi) Examples (3) & (4). Any distributions (actual, constructive or  deemed) that differ in timing or amount are given appropriate tax treatment.   For example, even  though an   employment agreement does not   result in a second élass   of   stock, excessive  ee paid under the agreement is not deductible.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS   675  depending upon whether the  right is substantially certain to be  exercised  by the  holder.®1  Straight Debt Safe Harbor. The interaction of the one-class-of-stock  limitation with the debt vs. equity classification   issues encountered  under Subchapter C®2 historically presented   some knotty problems for S corporations with outstanding debt. In  the formative years of Subchapter S, the Service adopted a practice of reclassifying nominal S corporation  debt owed to shareholders as a second class   of   stock, causing the  corporation to lose its S status.63 This threat has diminished considerably by a safe harbor provision in Section 1361(c)(5) under   which “straight  debt” is not treated as   a disqualifying second class   of stock. “Straight debt” is defined as any written unconditional promise to pay on demand  or on a specified date a sum certain in money if: (1) the   interest rate and payment dates are not contingent on profits, the borrower’s discretion or  similar factors; (2) the instrument is not convertible (directly or  indirectly) into   stock; and (3) the   creditor is an individual (other than a  nonresident alien), an   estate or trust that would be a qualifying shareholder in an S corporation, or  a person that is actively and regularly engaged in the business of lending money.® The fact that   an obligation is subordinated to other   debt of the corporation does not prevent it from qualifying as straight debt.®  Obligations   that   qualify   as   straight   debt   are   not   classified   as   a  second   class   of   stock   even   if they   would   be   considered   equity   under  general   tax   principles   and   they   generally   are   treated   as   debt   for   other purposes   of the   Code.®*   Thus,   interest   paid or accrued   on   straight   debt   is treated   as   such   by   the   corporation   and   the   recipient   and   does   not constitute   a   distribution   governed   by   Section   1368.67   But   if a   straight debt   instrument   bears   an   unreasonably   high   rate   of   interest,   the regulations   provide   than   an   “appropriate”   portion   may   be  recharacterized   and   treated   as   a   payment   that   is not   interest.68   If a   C  corporation   has   outstanding   debt   obligations   that   satisfy   the   straight  debt   definition   but   may   be   classified   as   equity   under   general   tax principles,   the   safe harbor   ensures   that   the obligation   will not be treated  as   a second   class   of stock   if the   C corporation   elects   to convert   to S status.  61 Reg. § 1.1361—1(/)(4)(iii). Exceptions are provided for certain call options in connection with   loans or  to employees   and   independent contractors. If the  strike   price of a  call option is at  least   90  percent of  the fair market value of  the underlying stock on the date  the  option is issued,  it  is not substantially   certain to be  exercised.   Reg. § 1.1361—1(1)(4)Gii)(B)-(C).  62 See   generally I.R.C. § 385 and   Chapter 3B,   supra. 63 The courts, however,   usually   were not   receptive to   this argument. See, e.g., Portage  Plastics   Co. v. United States,   486   F.2d   632 (7th   Cir.1973).  64   T.R.C.   § 1861(c)(5)(B). 6   Reg.   § 1.1361—1(/)(5)(i). 66 T.R.C. § 1361(c)(5)(A);   Reg. § 1.1361-1(0)(5)(iv). 67   Id. 68 Id. Such a reclassification   does   not   result   in  a  second   class   of stock.

676   TAXATION   OF   S CORPORATIONS   PART   3  The   conversion   and   change   of status   also   is not   treated   as   an   exchange  of the   debt   instrument   for stock.®9  PROBLEM  Unless   otherwise   indicated,   Z   Corporation   (“Z”’)   is   a   domestic corporation   which   has   120   shares   of voting   common   stock   outstanding.   In  each   of the   following   alternative   situations,   determine   whether Z   is eligible  to elect   S corporation   status:  (a)   Z   has   99 unrelated   individual   shareholders,   each_of   whom  —   owns   one share   of Z stock.   The   remaining 21 shares   are   owned  by   A   and   his   brother,   B,   as   joint   tenants   with   right   of  survivorship.   ~   an  (b)   Same   as   (a), above,   except   that   A   and   B are   married   and   own  ~   11   of the   21   shares   as   community   property.   The   remaining   10°  sharés   are   owned   5 by A _as her   separate   property   and 5 by_B_  as his separate   property.   iA  (c) In (b), above, assume that   the shareholders of Z elected S  Ok while sod m AS entity, corporation status. What will be the effect on Z’s election if one  year later A dies and bequeaths her interest in Z stock to F,  cme lagrbuee er ee sates A long-time friend? X  “(d)- Same as (a), above,   except that   the remaining 21 shares are held by a voting trust which has   three   beneficial owners.  (e) Same as (a), above,   except that   the remaining 21 shares are owned by a revocable living  trust created by an individual,   the  income of which is taxed to the grantor under § 671.  (f) Same as (a), above,   except   that   the remaining 21 shares are  owned by a testamentary trust under   which the surviving  spouse   has the   right to income for her life, with the remainder  passing to her children. The trust is a “qualified terminable  interest   trust”   (see § 2056(b)(7)).  (g) Assume Z has   100   individual shareholders   and   forms a  partnership   with   two other S corporations,   each of which also  have 100   individual   shareholders, for the purposes of  jointly operating a business. Z’s one-third interest in  this partnership  is  its only asset. (h) Zhas 100  shares of Class A \ voting common stock   and 50 shares _ of Class B   nonvoting common stock outstanding.   Apart from aiekee the   differences in voting   rights,   the two classes of  common Or ue vt \ Se stock have   equal rights with   regard to dividends   and liquidation   distributions. Z also has an authorized   but unissued class of nonvoting stock which   would be limited  and  preferred as to dividends.   The   Class A  common stock is owned by four  individuals   and   the  Class   B common stock is owned   by  EK and F (a married   couple) as tenants-in-common. 69 Reg.   § 1.1361—1(1)(5)(v).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS 677  (i) Same as (h), above, except that Z enters into a binding  — agreement with its shareholders to make larger annual  distributions to shareholders who bear heavier   state income (  tax burdens. The amount of the distributions is based on a worl CoG Sen  formula that will give   the shareholders equal after-tax  distributions.

678   TAXATION   OF   S CORPORATIONS   PART   3  Revocation   of Election.   An   S corporation   election   may   be   revoked   if shareholders   holding   more   than   one-half   of   the   corporation’s   shares (including   nonvoting   shares)   consent   to the   revocation.’®   The   revocation  may   specify   a prospective   effective   date.77   If a prospective   effective   date  is not   specified,   a   revocation   made   on   or   before   the   fifteenth   day   of the  third   month   of the taxable   year   is effective   on   the first day of the taxable  year   and   a revocation   made   after   that   date   is effective   on   the   first   day of the following   taxable   year.78 Termination   of Election.   Apart   from   revocation,   an   S   corporation  election   may   be   terminated   if   the   corporation   ceases   to   satisfy   the  definition   of a small   business   corporation   or,   in certain   circumstances,   if  the   corporation   earns   an   excessive   amount   of   passive   investment  income.’?9   The   first   ground   for   termination   is   easily   illustrated.  Terminating   events   include:   (1) exceeding   100   shareholders;   (2) issuance of   a   second   class   of   stock;   or   (3)   transfer   of   stock   to   an   ineligible  shareholder.   In   all those   cases,   the   corporation   will   cease   to be   a   small business   corporation   and   its S corporation   election   will   terminate   on   the day after the disqualifying   event.®°   To prevent   or cure   transfers   that   may  jeopardize   a corporation’s   S corporation   status,   the   shareholders   will   be  well   advised   at   the   outset   to   enter   into   an   agreement   restricting   stock  transfers.  The limitation on passive investment   income is more   complex. An  election to be an S   corporation will terminate if for three consecutive taxable   years the corporation’s   “passive investment   income” exceeds 25 percent of its gross   receipts and the corporation   has Subchapter   C  earnings   and profits.8!1 A termination triggered by excess passive investment   income is effective beginning on the first day of the taxable year   following the three   year   testing period.®2 It  is important to note   that the Subchapter   C earnings   and profits requirement has the effect of rendering this limitation inapplicable to a corporation that has always been an S corporation or which has been purged of its earnings   and profits.88 Passive investment   income generally is defined as gross  receipts from royalties,   rents, dividends, interest, and annuities,§4   but it  76 L.R.C. § 13862(d)(1)(B). See   Reg. § 1.1862—2(a).  ™7 LR.C. § 1862(d)(1)(D).  78 L.R.C. § 1362(d)(1)(C). If the revocation is effective   on a day other than the first day of  a taxable year (e.g., because a prospective date is selected in the middle of the year), the taxable  year will be an   “S termination year,” and the corporation will be   taxed pursuant to rules   in  Section 1362(e).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  does not include   gains on the disposition of property, or dividends  received by an S corporation   from a C corporation   subsidiary to the extent  they are attributable to earnings   and profits   of the subsidiary that are  derived from the active conduct of a trade or business.85   For purposes of  the overall   gross   receipts definition, gross receipts from sales or  exchanges of stock or securities are considered only to the extent of  gains.®6 Gross receipts on the disposition of capital   assets other than  stock or securities are taken into account only to the extent of the   excess of capital gains over   capital losses from such dispositions.87  When   an   S   corporation   election   terminates   during   the   S  corporation’s   taxable   year,   the corporation   experiences   an   “S termination year,” which   is divided   into two   short years:   an   S short year   and   a C short  year.88   Income,   gains,   losses,   deductions   and   credits   for an   S termination year   generally   may   be   allocated   between   the   two   short   years   on   a   pro  rata   basis   or   the   corporation   may   elect   to make   the   allocation   under   its normal   accounting   rules.89   The   corporation’s   tax   liability   for   the   short taxable   year   as   a   C   corporation   is   then   computed   on   an   annualized  basis.9°  Inadvertent   Terminations.   If an   S corporation   election   is terminated, the   corporation   generally   is not   eligible   to make   another   election   for five taxable   years   unless   the   Treasury   consents   to   an   earlier   election.®!  Section   1362(f)   provides   relief   if   a   termination   is   caused   by   the  corporation   ceasing   to   be   a   small   business   corporation   or   by   excessive passive   investment   income.   The   corporation   will be treated   as continuing as   an   S corporation   and   the   terminating   event   will be   disregarded   if: (1) the   Service   determines   that   the   termination   was   inadvertent,   (2)   the corporation   takes   steps   within   a reasonable   time   to rectify   the   problem,  and   (3)   the   corporation   and   its   shareholders   agree   to   make   whatever  adjustments   are   required   by   the   Service.9?   The   corporation   has   the burden   of establishing   that   under   the   relevant   facts   and   circumstances  the   Commissioner   should   determine   that   the   termination   was  inadvertent.   Under   the   regulations,   inadvertence   may   be established   by showing   that   the   terminating   event   was   not   reasonably   within   the control   of the   corporation   and   was   not   part   of a   plan   to   terminate   the  8   [R.C.   § 1362(d)(3)(C)Qv). 86   RC.   § 13862(d)(3)(B) (ai). 87   J.R.C.   § 1362(d)(3)(B)Q@).  88 .R.C. § 1362(e)(1).

Taxable   Year   of an   S Corporation.   To   preclude   S corporations   from using   fiscal   years   to achieve   a deferral   of the   shareholders’   tax   liability, S corporations   must   use   a “permitted   year,”   which   is defined   as   either   a calendar   year   or an   accounting   period   for which   the   taxpayer   establishes a business   purpose.%4   The   Service   has   ruled   that   the   business   purpose  requirement   may   be   satisfied   if   the   desired   tax   accounting   period  coincides   with   a “natural   business   year”   and   has   quantified   the concept with   the   same   25-percent   test   applicable   to partnerships   seeking   to use a natural   business   fiscal year.9*   Under   this   test,   a natural   business   year exists   if 25   percent   or   more   of the   S corporation’s   gross   receipts   for the selected   12-month   period   are   earned   in   the   last   two   months.   This   25- percent   test must   be met   in each   of the preceding   three   12-month   periods  that   correspond   to the   requested   fiscal   year.97  Section 1378 makes it clear that tax deferral for shareholders does not constitute a business purpose for a fiscal year. The legislative history also identifies several factors which generally do not support a claim of  business purpose:98  The conferees   intend that (1) the   use   of a particular   year for  regulatory or financial accounting purposes; (2) the hiring patterns of a particular   business, e.g., the fact that a firm typically   hires staff during certain times of the year; (8) the  use of a particular   year for administrative   purposes,   such as the  admission or retirement of partners or shareholders, promotion  of staff, and compensation or retirement arrangements with  staff, partners, or shareholders:   and (4) the fact that a particular business involves   the   use   of  price lists, model year, or other items that change on   an annual basis ordinarily will not be sufficient to establish   that the business   purpose   requirement for a particular   taxable   year   has   been met.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS 681  change to a fiscal year under certain   conditions, including the payment  of an   entity-level tax designed to represent the value of any tax deferral  to the shareholders that would result from the use of the fiscal year. The rules governing the fiscal year election and the required entity-level  payment are found in Sections   444 and 7519.  Section   444   permits   a newly   formed   S corporation   to elect   to use   a taxable   year   other   than   the   calendar   year   required   by   Section   1378  provided   that   the   year   elected   results   in   no   more   than   a   three-month  deferral   of income   to the shareholders.99   An   election   and the Section   7519  payment   is   not   required,   however,   for   any   S   corporation   that   has established   a   business   purpose   for   a   fiscal   year   under   Section  1378(b)(2).100  The   trade-off   for   a   Section   444   fiscal   year   election   is   that   the  corporation   must   make   a “required   payment”   under   Section   7519   for any  taxable   year   for   which   the   election   is in   effect.   The   mechanics   of the  required   payment   are   annoyingly   complex,   but   the   concept   is clear.   An electing   S corporation   must   pay   and   keep   “on deposit”   an   amount   roughly approximating   the   value   of the   tax   deferral   that   the   shareholders   would  have   achieved   from   the   use   of a   fiscal   year.   Thus,   if an   S corporation whose   shareholders   all used   calendar   years   elected   a fiscal   year   ending  September   30,   the   corporation   would   be   required   to   pay   a   tax   that  supposedly   equaled   the   tax   benefit   from   the   three   months   deferral received   by the   shareholders.!°!   Under   a de minimis   rule,   no   payment   is  required   if the   amount   due   is less   than   $500,192   and   a payment   made   in  one   year   generates   a balance   “on deposit” that may   be used in subsequent  years. 103 fy ee D  PROBLEM joo \ (tbe ie  Snowshoe, Inc.

Although an S   corporation is generally exempt  from tax,!04 it nonetheless must   determine its gross income, 195  deductions   and other tax items in order to establish   the amounts which  pass through to the shareholders.   Like a partnership, an S  corporation computes its “taxable income” in the same manner as an individual except   that   certain deductions   unique to individuals (e.g., personal exemptions,   alimony,   medical   and moving expenses) are   not allowed.106 In addition, deductions   normally available   only to corporations,   such as  the dividends   received   deduction, are not allowed,!°7   but an S  corporation  may elect   to deduct   and   amortize its organizational   expenses   under Section 248.198   Finally, a wide   variety of items must be   separately  104 For   the few   limited   exceptions, see Section F of  this chapter, infra. 105 1 Section   1366(c)   provides   that a shareholder’s pro   rata share of  the S cor  mcome 1s used to determine the   shareholder’s   gross   income.  106 T.R.C. § 13863(b)(2).  107 $.Rep.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  computed in order to preserve their special   tax character as they  passthrough to the shareholders.109 Although an § corporation is generally not a taxable entity, it is  treated as an   entity for various   purposes. For example, tax elections  affecting   the computation of items   derived from an S corporation (e.g., to  defer recognition of gain on an involuntary conversion under Section  1033) generally are made at the corporate level,119 as are the exclusions  from   discharge of indebtedness   income in Section   108 and the  accompanying rules on reduction of tax   attributes.111 Likewise, limitations on deductions (e.g., the dollar limitation under Section 179 on  expensing the cost of certain recovery   property) apply at the corporate level and often at the shareholder level as well.!!2 And like a partnership,  an S corporation is treated as an   entity for  filing tax returns and other  procedural purposes.113  Pass-Through   of Income   and   Deductions.   Once   the   S corporation’s tax   items   have   been   identified,   the   next   step is to determine   the   manner in   which   they   pass   through   to   the   shareholders.   First,   income   and deductions   are   characterized   at   the   corporate   level.1!4   Section 1366(a)(1)(A)   provides   that items   which   may   have   potentially   varying   tax consequences   to   the   individual   shareholders   must   be   separately computed.   The   most   common   of these   items   are   capital   and   Section   1231 gains   and   losses,   qualified   dividends,   interest   and   other   types   of “portfolio   income”   under   the   Section   469   passive   loss   limitations,   tax- exempt   interest,   charitable   contributions,   investment   interest   expense, foreign   taxes,   intangible   drilling   expenses   and   depletion   on   oil and   gas properties.!15   Thus,   Section   1231   gains   and   losses   do   not   fall   into   any corporate   hotchpot;   rather,   they   pass   through   and   are   aggregated   with each   shareholder’s   other   Section   1231   gains   and   losses   in   order   to  determine   their   ultimate   character.   All   the   nonseparately   stated   items  are   aggregated   and   the   resulting   lump   sum   passes   through   as   ordinary  income   or loss.  In determining its taxable   income, an S corporation is not entitled to  any   charitable   deduction.   Rather,   corporate   charitable   contributions pass  through to the shareholders   without   regard to the   10 percent of taxable 109 T.R.C. §§ 1363(b)(1);   1366(a)(1)(A).  10   [T.R.C.   § 1363(c)(1).  111 T.R.C. § 108(d)(7). Under this   rule, discharge of indebtedness   income may be excluded  from gross income if the S  corporation is bankrupt or insolvent   even if the shareholders are not.  In  contrast, if  all  or part of a partnership debt is cancelled,   the discharge of indebtedness   income is allocated to the partners who   must individually determine if an   exclusion is available.

Allocation   and   Timing.   The   shareholders   of an   S corporation   take into   account   their   respective   pro   rata   shares   of income,   deductions   and  other   separately   stated   items   on   a pro   rata,   per   share   daily basis.118   For  this   purpose,   “pro   rata”   means   in   proportion   to   each   shareholder’s  ownership   of stock.   Unlike   partnerships   and   LLCs,   S corporations   have no   flexibility   to   make   special   allocations   by   agreement.   As   for   timing, these   items   are   reported   in the   shareholder’s   taxable   year   in which   the  corporation’s   taxable   year   ends.119   For   example,   if an   S corporation   with a natural   business   year   uses   a fiscal   year   ending   January   31,   2021,   the  shareholders   will report   the respective   pass-through   items   on   their   2021 calendar   year   tax returns,   thus   achieving   a healthy   deferral   of any   gains  or   an   unfortunate   delay   in   recognizing   any   losses.   A   deceased shareholder’s   Subchapter   S items   are   allocated   on   a daily basis   between  the   shareholder’s   final   income   tax   return   and   the   initial   return   of the  decedent’s   estate.120 Treatment of a Family Group.   To guard against   easy assignments of income, if a “member of the family” of an S   corporation shareholder  (defined to include a spouse,   ancestors, and lineal descendants)   performs services for or furnishes capital to the corporation   without receiving  reasonable compensation, the Service is authorized to reallocate tax items to properly reflect the value of the   services or capital.121 The   IRS may invoke this power even if the provider of services or capital does not  own any stock of the corporation   but is merely related to  a shareholder. Basis Adjustments.   S corporation shareholders increase the basis of  their stock by their respective   shares of income items   (including tax- exempt income!22) and   reduce basis   (but  not below zero) by their   pro   rata  u6   T.R.C.   § 170(b)(2)(A).

The   2017   Act   replaced   those graduated rates with a single corporate income tax   rate   of  21   percent. 128  During the gestation   period of  the 2017 Act,   legislators who favored tax relief   for business   income   became   concerned   about the prospect of  providing a significant   rate reduction for public companies   and other C  tm, Corporations to the   exclusion of “small   businesses,” a loosely   defined  category   that   includes many enterprises   conducted in  the form of  “pass-  through” entities such as S   corporations   and   partnerships.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS 687  as 37 percent for individual   owners. Congress enacted Section 199A to level the playing field for the many taxpayers utilizing a pass-through entity to conduct their businesses.  At its most basic level, Section 199A provides an income tax  deduction to individuals, trusts and estates equal to 20 percent of the “qualified business   income”   generated   through a sole proprietorship,  partnership, LLC, S corporation, trust, or estate.129 When fully available,  the deduction effectively lowers the tax   rate applicable to such income from 37 to 29.6 percent (80 percent of 37 percent) for the highest income taxpayers. Although the Section 199A deduction is not allowed in  computing adjusted gross income,!89 it nonetheless is available to all taxpayers regardless of whether they itemize deductions or claim the  standard deduction.1!31  Despite   its fairly   straightforward   purpose,   Section   199A   contains   a complex   web   of   defined   terms,   limitations,   anti-abuse   rules,   and  industry-specific   provisions.   Much   of this   complexity   is designed   to deny or   limit   the   deduction   for high-income   taxpayers   who   conduct   either:   (1) service-oriented   businesses,   or   (2) other   businesses   which   do   not   have  sufficiently   large   employee   payrolls   or   a   mix   of lower   payrolls   and   a  significant   investment   in depreciable   real   estate   and   equipment. In keeping   with   the   “fundamentals”   approach,   the   text   below   offers a general   description   of this   daunting   statute’s   framework   and   addresses its application   in a few   typical   situations.  Qualified   Business   Income   Defined.   The   first   step   under   Section 199A   is to   determine   the   “qualified   business   income”   (“QBI”)   of each   of the taxpayer’s   qualified   trades   or businesses.!82   QBI   is the net amount   of  qualified   items   of income,   gain,   deduction   and   loss   that   are   effectively  connected   with   the   conduct   of a   qualified   trade   or   business   within   the  United   States   and   which   are   included   or allowed   in determining   taxable income   for the   taxable   year.133  QBI must be  derived   from a qualified   “trade or business,” a term that  is not defined by either   the   statute or the   legislative history of Section 199A. The regulations fill the gap by providing that   “trade or business”  should be defined by its meaning under Section 162, excluding the  trade  1229 Unless   Congress   extends   Section   199A, the deduction is scheduled to terminate for  taxable   years beginning after 2025. I.R.C. § 199A(Q). ~ 130 [.R.C. § 62(a). Thus, the  Section 199A deduction   has no  effect on  other deductions   which are subject to limitations based on adjusted gross income. See, e.g., § 170(b)   (percentage  limitations on   the  charitable   deduction); § 213(a)   (limitation   on deduction for medical   expenses).  131   T.R.C.   § 63(b)(3).  132 The   deduction   technically is based on a taxpayer’s   qualified   business   income   amount,  which also includes   qualified   dividends   from real   estate investment trusts   (including REIT  mutual funds)   and   qualified   publicly   traded   partnership   income. LR.C.   § 199A(a),   (b)(1), (e)(8)  & (4). Special   rules   also   apply to certain   agricultural   and   horticultural   cooperatives.   I.R.C. §  199A(g).   Those   aspects   of  Section   199A are   not   discussed   here.  133   T.R.C.   § 199A(c)(1),   (3)(A).

688  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  or business of providing services as an employee.134 This cross reference requires an analysis based on the   vast body of case law and administrative guidance interpreting the term for purposes of the  ordinary   and   necessary   business expense deduction. 185  If a   taxpayer   is   actively   engaged   in   an   activity   and   has a   profit motive,   it is usually   not very   difficult   to achieve   trade   or business   status under   the   Section   162   standard.   The   major   definitional   question  requiring   clarification   is whether   a taxpayer’s   rental   real   estate   activity  can   be   a   qualified   trade   or   business.   The   Service   declined   to   deem   all  rental   real   estate   activity   to be   a trade   or   business   or   establish   a bright  line   test,   but   it has   provided   a   safe   harbor   in   the   form   of a   proposed  revenue   procedure.!386   Under   this   guidance,   a   rental   trade   or   business enterprise   will   be treated   as   a trade   or   business   if at least   250   hours   of services   are   performed   annually   with   respect   to   the   business   by   the  owner   or   others,   such   as   employees   and   independent   contractors.   The  types   of service   that   count   toward   the   250-hour   requirement   include maintenance,   repairs,   collection   of rent,   payment   of expenses,   providing  services   to tenants,   and   efforts   to rent   the property.   The   safe harbor   also  requires   the   taxpayer   to maintain   contemporaneous   separate   books   and records   and   bank   accounts   for   the   business.   Activities   specifically excluded   from   the   safe   harbor   are   triple   net   leases   (where   the   lease requires   the   tenant   to   pay   all   real   estate   taxes,   maintenance,   and  insurance),   and   rented   property   that   is used   in part   as   a residence   (such  as   a vacation   home).   If an   enterprise   fails   to satisfy   the   requirements   of  the   safe harbor,   it still may   qualify   as   a trade   or business   if it otherwise  meets   the   more   general   requirements   in the   regulations. Consistent   with the intention to limit the deduction to operating income, the   definition of QBI excludes a broad   range of items that  generally are derived from investment activities—including, among other   things,   capital gains or losses, dividends, and interest   (other than interest properly allocated to a trade or business).137   Similarly,  184 Reg. § 1.199A—1(b)(14). The regulations   include a special   rule providing that,   solely for purposes of Section 199A, the   rental or licensing of tangible or intangible   property to  a related trade or business is treated as a “trade or business” if the   rental or licensing activity and the related business are commonly controlled (i.e., the same   owner or group of owners   must   own 50 percent or more of both the   rental property   and the   related   business)   even if the   activity does not rise to the level   of a Section   162   trade or business. ae See, e.g., Higgins Vv. Commissioner, 312   U.S. 212   (1941) (whether a trade or business exists 1s a factual determination); Commissioner v. Groetzinger,   480 U.S.   23   (1967)   (a  trade or  business   must be   regular   and   continuous, pursued full time, and not be a sporadic activity or  mere hobby).  186 See   Notice   2019-07,   2019-09   LR.B.   740   (providing   form of proposed   revenue procedure).  eI   EG § 199A(c)(3)(B).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  deductions   and losses attributable to these items are not taken into  account in determining QBI.138  Section 199A fails to address one type of income frequently encountered in a business setting: Section 1231   gains and losses. Most  Section   1231   gains and losses are derived from sales or exchanges of assets used in a trade or business, which suggests   they   should be  included in QBI.   But the Section   1231 characterization process may  result in items being   characterized as capital gains and losses, which are explicitly excluded   from the   definitions of QBI. The regulations resolve this statutory ambiguity   by falling back on the characterization process  employed by Section 1231. If the taxpayer’s Section   1231   gains exceed  Section   1231 losses so that all those   gains and losses are characterized as long-term capital gains and losses, they are excluded   from the  definition of QBI.189   Alternatively, if the taxpayer’s Section   1231   gains  and losses are characterized as ordinary rather than capital, they are included in QBI, assuming the   other statutory requirements are  satisfied.  Treatment   of Income   from   Services.   The   most   significant   exclusion from   the   definition   of   QBI   relates   to   compensation   income.   Because performing   services   as   an   employee   is   not   a   trade   or   business   for  purposes   of Section   199A,   wages   received   by an   employee   are   not   QBI.149  QBI   also   does   not include   reasonable   compensation   paid to a taxpayer   for services   rendered   to   a   qualified   trade   or   business.!41   The   exclusion   of  “reasonable   compensation”   from   QBI   was   intended   to   signal   that  amounts   paid   to   a   shareholder-employee   of   an   S   corporation   could include   amounts   that   are   not formally   designated   as compensation,   if the  corporation   fails   to   pay   its   shareholder-employee   reasonable  compensation   for   services.142   In   contrast,   income   earned   by   a   sole  proprietor   or   an   independent   contractor   generally   may   qualify   as   QBI.  Thus,   Section   199A   does   not   exclude   all income   from   labor   or   services  from   QBI.   Instead,   the   rules   initially   distinguish   between   income   from  labor   or   services   based   on   whether   the   taxpayer   has   the   legal   status   of  being   an   “employee.”   In   so   doing,   the   statute   ensures   that   income  generated   from   services   provided   by   an   employee   is   fully   taxed   at  ordinary   income   tax   rates.  To illustrate these   distinctions, assume Alice conducts a business  that provides pet care   services for individuals who   work during the   day.  2   138   T.R.C.   § 199A(c)(3)(B)(vii).  139 See   Reg. § 1.199A—3(b)(2)(ii)(A)   (excluding all capital   gains and losses, and   “including any   item   treated as one   of such   items   under   any   other   provision of  the   Code”).  140   T.R.C.   § 199A(d)(1)(B). 141   TRC.   § 199A(c)(4)(A). 142 Preamble to Proposed   Section   199A   Regulations, REG—107892-18, Explanation   of Provisions, at 37-38   (Aug.   8,  2018), 2018-35 I.R.B.   353. The   Service   has   indicated   that   this  recharacterization   approach is limited to the  S corporation   context. The final regulations   under Section   199A   describe   this   exclusion   from   QBI as “reasonable   compensation   received   by a  shareholder   from   an S corporation.”   Reg.   §  1.199A—3(b)(2)(Gi)(H).  689

690 TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  Because she is not an employee, Alice’s entire income from her sole proprietorship qualifies as QBI, even though the bulk of that income is  generated by her personal services. If Alice’s business grows and she hires Brady as an employee to help service her expanding   customer base, the salary Alice pays to Brady will not be QBI. Does the difference in how ~  Alice and Brady are treated under Section 199A make sense? To be sure, many sole proprietors are exposed to   a large degree of entrepreneurial risk and their businesses may involve a significant investment of capital. But the   distinctions drawn in the   definition of QBI do not focus on those factors. Instead, the   statute generally   operates in an “all   or nothing”  fashion, based on the taxpayer’s status as an employee.  For   pass-through   entities,   the   rules   regarding   income   from   labor   or  services   differ   depending   on   whether   the   entity   is an   S corporation   or   a  partnership   or   LLC.   Because   an S   corporation   is treated   as   an   entity separate   from   its   shareholders,   an   S   corporation   shareholder   who  performs   service   for the   corporation   is generally   treated   as   an   employee  for   tax   purposes.   Accordingly,   QBI   does   not   include   reasonable  compensation   paid   to   the _ shareholder-employee   or   amounts  recharacterized   as   such,!43   but   a   shareholder’s   pro   rata   share   of an   S corporation’s   net business   profits   generally   will qualify for the 20 percent  deduction.  Determining the Section 199A Deduction. Once the QBI from each of the taxpayer’s qualified trades or businesses is determined, the taxpayer multiplies the QBI from   each   such trade or business by 20 percent and  the Section 199A deduction generally   equals the sum of those separate calculations.144 Various limitations   apply, both when calculating the  deductible amount for each   trade or business and the total allowable Section 199A deduction. Overall,   the Section 199A deduction may not  exceed 20 percent of the   excess of the taxpayer’s   taxable income (determined   without   regard to the Section 199A deduction), reduced   by net  capital  gain.!45 This   limitation   typically will apply  only when the bulk  of an   individual’s taxable income consists of QBI. If, in a given year, the  sum of the taxpayer’s QBI calculations is negative,   the taxpayer has a loss   for the   year from the combined qualified   trades or businesses that will carry   over to the   next   year when it will be   treated as a loss from a qualified   trade or business. 146  To illustrate a straightforward application of Section   199A, assume  A, a single taxpayer who does   not itemize   deductions,   practices law as   a  solo practitioner. Over the   course of   the   year,   A’s   practice generates  $140,000 of legal   fees and   $2,000 of  interest income   from   her   business  143, T:R.C. § 199A(c)(4)(A); see Rev.   Rul. 74—44,   1974-1 C.B.   287.  144 TRC.   § 199A(a)(1), (b)(1)—-(2)(A).  145 T.R.C. § 199A(a)(2), (e)(1). Net capital   gain   generally   consists   of net   lon i  , ')(2), -term tal  gains   (including   collectibles   gains   and   unrecaptured section   1250   gains)   less Bs  meee,  capital   losses   (see I.R.C. §  1222(1 1)), plus qualified   dividends.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS 691  deposits. A incurs $40,000 of deductible expenses attributable to her  practice, and she has no other   sources of income. In this   case, A is  engaged in a qualified trade or business under Section 199A, as she is  not providing services in an employee capacity. While her net income  from the  practice totals $102,000, only $100,000 constitutes QBI because  the $2,000 of interest income is excluded   from the definition.147 A’s taxable income   (computed without the Section 199A deduction) is  $90,000   ($102,000 minus a $12,000   standard deduction) and she has no  net capital gain.!48 Accordingly, A may deduct 20 percent of the lesser of (1) her $100,000 of QBI from the law practice or (2) the $90,000 of taxable income   amount. Thus, A’s Section 199A deduction is $18,000 (20 percent  of $90,000), reducing her final taxable income to $72,000. Note that if A  were an associate in a law firm and her wages as an employee were  $100,000, she would not be entitled to any   deduction under Section   199A.  Limitations   for   High-Income   Taxpayers.   The   basic   application   of Section   199A   becomes   considerably   more   complex   once   a   taxpayer  reaches   certain   taxable   income   thresholds.   Those   thresholds— determined   without   reference   to   the   deduction   otherwise   provided   by  Section   199A—are   $157,500   for   a   single   taxpayer   and   $315,000   for married   taxpayers   filing   jointly   (with   each   figure   being   indexed   for  inflation   after   2018).   Once   these   thresholds   are   reached,   Section   199A  imposes   two   additional   independent   limitations.   First,   the   statute  excludes   certain   specified   service-predominant   activities   from   the  definition   of a qualified   trade   or business.   Second,   the   statute   imposes   a  cap   on   the   amount   otherwise   deductible   under   Section   199A   for a trade or   business,   determined   by reference   to   a percentage   of the   W-2   wages paid   by the   business   (i.e., wages   paid to its employees)   or,   alternatively, by reference   to a lesser   percentage   of W-2   wages   paid   and   the cost   of the depreciable   property   used   by   the   business   in   the   production   of   QBI.  These   limitations,   addressed   in   more   detail   below,   are   fully   phased   in when   taxable   income   reaches   $50,000   above   the   threshold   amount   for single   taxpayers   ($210,700   in   2019)   and   $100,000   above   the   threshold  amount   for   married   taxpayers   filing jointly   ($421,400   in   2019).   Within  the phase-in   range,   the limitations   are   each   applied based   on the ratio by  which   the   taxable   income   of the   taxpayer   over   the   threshold   amount  bears   to $50,000   for single   taxpayers,   or   $100,000   for married   taxpayers  filing jointly.149   For purposes   of simplicity,   the discussion   below   will refer to the limitations   as applied in their fully phased-in   form   to “high-income taxpayers.” Limitation for   Specified   Service   Trades or Businesses.   For   high-  income   taxpayers,   Section 199A   excludes   any “specified   service   trade or 147. The IRS’s   position is that   interest income   earned on working capital, reserves, and similar   funds is not QBI   because it  is not   allocable to   a trade or business.   Reg. §  1.199A— 3(b)(2)(ii)(C);   see   I.R.C. § 199A(c)(3)(B) (Gu).  148 The   example   disregards   inflation   adjustments to  the   standard   deduction.  49   LR.C. § 199A(b)(3)(B), (d)(3)B).

692  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  business” (‘SSTB”)   from the   definition of a qualified trade or business. 1°°  An SSTB for this purpose includes any trade or business involving the  performance of services in the fields of health,   law, accounting,   actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services,  brokerage services, and any trade or business the principal asset of which ~ is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners.1!°1  Notably, engineers and architects are excluded   from the list of affected  trades or businesses,   while investment managers and traders in  securities are singled out for inclusion in the SSTB category.152  As   explained   in the   legislative   history   of the   2017   Act,   the   taxable  income   thresholds   at   which   the   exclusion   for   an   SSTB   begin   to   apply  were   intended   by   Congress   “to   deter   high-income   taxpayers   from attempting   to convert   wages   or other   compensation   for personal   services to income   eligible   for   the   20   percent   deduction   under   the   provision.” 153  The   exclusion,   however,   applies   without   regard   to   the   taxpayer’s  subjective   motivation.   Returning   to   the   basic   example   above,   if   A were  married   and   filed a joint return   with   her husband   B who   earned   $350,000  in salary   as   an   employee,   A’s   law   practice   would   no   longer   constitute   a  qualified   trade   or business   for purposes   of Section   199A.154  The catch-all provision in the   definition of SSTB—that is, any trade or business the principal asset of which is the reputation or   skill of its  employees or owners—garnered considerable attention within the tax  community, as   a significant amount of income of small businesses in particular can be   traced to the human capital of   their owners or  employees.   The “reputation or   skill” category therefore was potentially broad in  scope. The Service, however, has   signaled that it does not intend  to pursue an expansive interpretation of that aspect of the   statute. Noting that   the clause was   intended to encompass “a narrow set” of  trades or businesses not otherwise specifically enumerated in the  statute, the regulations limit   this category to trades or businesses   generating the  following   three   types of income: (1) endorsement fees;   (2) fees  attributable to licensing an individual’s image, likeness, name, etc.; and  (3) appearance fees.155 Note that   these   categories are largely predicated  on   the reputation of  the individual generating the fee income as opposed to the individual’s skill in a particular field alone.  150 L.R.C. § 199A(d)(1)(A), (3).  yah   Tae area (incorporating,   with   modifications, the   definition under I.R.C.  402(e)(3)(A)). The regulations define each of these fields   in meticul detai  MVeeeOtE ae 1culous detail. See   Reg.  152 T.R.C. § 199A(d)(2).  153 H.R.   Rep.   No. 415-466,   115th   Cong., 1st Sess. 222 (2017).  164 Given the loss   of  the   Section 199A   deduction for A in this   setting,   the   couple   would want  to explore   the  prospect of  filing separate   returns. The   threshold amounts for applying   the limitations   on high-income   taxpayers   under   Section   199A are   the same for  single   individuals  and for married   individuals filing separately.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS 693  If a particular   trade or business constitutes an SSTB within the  meaning of Section 199A(d)(1)(A) and the taxpayer is subject to this  limitation in determining QBI, none of the tax items from the business  may be considered in determining QBI whether or not the taxpayer  actually   participates in the   service activity. Given this blanket  prohibition,   the Service has articulated a de minimis rule for businesses  that generate only a fraction of income from specified service activities. A trade or business is not treated as an SSTB for purposes of Section  199A(d)(1)(A) if the business   has gross   receipts of $25 million or less and  less than 10 percent of its gross receipts is attributable to the  performance of services in one of the   statutorily designated fields or  activities. 156  The   denial   of a Section   199A   deduction   for income   generated   through  an   SSTB   for   high-income   taxpayers   creates   a   powerful   incentive   for  businesses   to   segregate   proscribed   service   activities   from   other   sources of income.   The   Service   is well   aware   of this incentive   and   has   responded with   an   anti-abuse   rule.   Under   the   Section   199A   regulations,   if a trade or business   provides   property   or   services   to an   SSTB   and   the   two   trades or   businesses   share   50   percent   or   more   common   ownership   (directly   or  by way   of attribution),   that   portion   of the trade   or business   providing   the property   or   service   to   the   50   percent   or   more   SSTB   is   treated   as   a separate   SSTB   as   to the   related   parties.157   To   illustrate   this   basic   anti- abuse   rule,   assume   a   doctor   owns   an   office   building   that   she   leases  exclusively   to   her   medical   practice.   Because   the   entire   building   is  provided   to   a   commonly   controlled   SSTB   (her   medical   practice),   the  leasing   arrangement   is also   treated   as   an   SSTB.   The   anti-abuse   rule  eliminates   the   incentive   the   doctor   has   to   separate   the   rental   income  from   her professional   services   in order   to obtain   a Section   199A   deduction with   respect   to   the   rental   income.   However,   if only   half of the   building were   leased   to   the   practice   with   the   other   half   being   leased   to   an unrelated   party,   the   leasing   operation   would   not be considered   an   SSTB  in its entirety.   Rather,   only the half of the rental   income   derived   from   the medical   practice   would   be   treated   as   generated   from   an   SSTB, preventing   its inclusion   in QBI.  Limitations Based on W-2   Wages   and   Unadjusted Basis in Qualified  Property.   In addition to limitations on   the range of activities that will constitute a qualified   trade or business, high-income   taxpayers face a separate   limitation on   the amount that   can   be deducted   under Section  199A.   For high-income taxpayers, the   deductible amount for any ‘qualified   trade or business is limited to the   greater of: (1) 50   percent of  the “W-2   wages”   with  respect to the qualified   trade or business, or  (2) the sum of  25  percent of  those   “W-2   wages” plus 2.5 percent of  the unadjusted  156 Reg. § 1.199A—5(c)(1)(i). If the gross   receipts   of  the  trade or business  exceed   $25   million, the   de  minimis safe harbor   applies   only if  less than   5  percent of gross   receipts   are attributable to otherwise   specified   service   activities. Reg. § 1.199A—5(c)(1)Gi). .  157 Reg.   §  1.199A—5(c)(2)().   The   attribution  rules   of  Section   267(b)   and   Section   707(b)   are applied   for this  purpose.   Reg.   §  1.199A—5(c)(2)(aii).

694 TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  basis immediately after acquisition of all “qualified property” used in the  trade or business. 158  The   scope   of W-2   wages   for purposes   of this   limitation   includes   the  total   amount   of wages   subject   to income   tax   withholding,   amounts   paid   |  into   qualified   retirement   accounts   (such   as   Section   401(k)   plans),   and certain   other   forms   of deferred   compensation   paid to the employees   of the business.159   For labor-intensive   businesses,   50 percent   of W-2   wages   paid  by   the   business   likely   will   serve   as   the   relevant   cap   on   the   amount  deductible   from   that   trade   or   business.   On   the   other   hand,   for   capital-  intensive   businesses   such   as real estate   ventures,   the alternate   cap   likely  will be higher.   This   limitation   starts   with   25   percent   of W-2   wages   paid by the   trade   or   business   and   adds   2.5   percent   of the   unadjusted   basis (immediately   after acquisition)   of “qualified property.”   Qualified   property encompasses   depreciable   tangible   property—real   or   personal—held   by  and   available   for use   in a qualified   trade   or   business   at the   close   of the  taxable   year,   which   is   used   in   the   production   of   qualified   business  income,   and   for   which   the   depreciable   period   of the   property   has   not  ended   before   the   close   of the   taxable   year.169   The   “depreciable   period”   of  property   for purposes   of Section   199A   ends   upon   the   later   of (a) 10 years  after   the   date   the   property   is placed   in service,   or   (b) the   last   day   of the last   full   year   in the   applicable   recovery   period   that   would   apply   to   the property   under   Section   168   (determined   without   regard   to   the  alternative   depreciation   system   of Section   168(g)).161  Apportionment Rules. Section 199A is applied at the shareholder  level  in the case   of businesses   operated as S corporations. 162 Accordingly, all the tax items of the business, together   with the W-2   wages   and the  unadjusted basis in qualified   property, must be   allocated among the shareholders.   Section 199A provides special   rules for this purpose. An § corporation is required to report   these items to its shareholders on a Schedule K-1, and must identify any trade or business that is an SSTB.163  Each S corporation   shareholder takes into account   only  that  person’s “allocable share” of each   item of income, gain, deduction   and loss from  the  qualified   trade or business.164 The allocable share of a shareholder in an S  corporation is based on pro-rata   stock ownership.   With respect to determining the   cap   applicable to  a taxpayer’s   deduction   under Section  199A,   those amounts will be determined   by reference to the shareholder’s  158 T.R.C. § 199A(b)(2)(B).  159 T.R.C. § 199A(b)(4).  160 T.R.C. § 199A(b)(6)(A).  161 J.R.C. § 199A(b)(6)(B).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  allocable share of the W-2 wages and unadjusted basis of qualified  property in the trade or business.165  Example. The example below illustrates the operation of Section 199A in a situation implicating the limitations on high-income taxpayers.  C, a single taxpayer, is a 25 percent shareholder of an S corporation  that operates a restaurant. C’s pro   rata share of net operating income  from the corporation totals $100,000 for the year. C also has $200,000 of  taxable income from sources unrelated to the business,   subjecting him to the high-income limitations imposed by Section   199A. The S corporation  pays its employees $120,000 in wages during the taxable year. The  corporation leases   the building in which the restaurant is located, but it  owns equipment and furnishings having a $400,000 unadjusted basis  and a recovery period of ten years under Section 168. The corporation  expensed the cost of the equipment and furnishings under Section 168(k) when it placed them into service two years ago.  C’s   deduction   under   Section   199A   is equal   to   the   lesser   of:   (1) 20 percent   of   C’s   allocable   share   of   qualified   income   from   the   trade   or business   (note   that   it is not   a specified   service   trade   or   business),   or   (2) the   greater   of: (a) 50   percent   of the   C’s   allocable   share   of the   W-2   wages paid by the   S corporation   or (b) 25 percent   of C’s allocable   share   of the W-  2 wages   paid   by the   corporation   plus   2.5   percent   of the   unadjusted   basis  of qualified   property   used   in the   corporation’s   trade   or business.   C’s pro  rata   share   of all tax   items   from   the   business   is based   on   his   25   percent stock   ownership   and   thus   the starting   point for calculating   C’s deduction  under   Section   199A   is 20   percent   of $100,000,   or   $20,000.   However,   this  amount   is limited   to the greater   of the following   two   amounts:   50 percent of C’s   $30,000   share   of W-2   wages   paid by the S corporation   ($15,000)   or 25   percent   of C’s   $30,000   share   of W-2   wages   ($7,500)   plus   2.5 percent   of  C’s   $100,000   share   of the   unadjusted   basis   of qualified   property   held   by  the corporation   ($2,500),   for a total of $10,000.   Accordingly,   C’s deduction under   Section   199A   is   capped   at   $15,000,   the   higher   of   these   two  amounts.  PROBLEM  Alice is  a world famous chef who operates Chez   Panache (“Chez”), a  restaurant   structured as an S corporation. She is the sole shareholder. In the current year, Chez   generates $2.5   million of  gross   receipts and   incurs   $1 million of deductible   operating   expenses. In   addition,   the corporation   pays  Alice a salary of $200,000   and   $400,000 in wages to other employees.   Chez’s net income is thus   $900,000, all of which passes through to  Alice, who has no  income   from   other   sources. Assume that   the   corporation   does   not own   any  “qualified   property”   within   the meaning of § 199A(b)(6). (a) Consider   whether Alice is entitled to  a §  199A   deduction   with  respect to her  income   from   Chez’s   business.  165 T.R.C.   §  199A(f)(1)(A) (aii).  695

IN GENERAL  Section   1866(d)   limits   the   amount   of losses   or   deductions   that   may  pass   through   to a shareholder   to the   sum   of the   shareholder’s   adjusted basis   in   the   stock   plus   the   adjusted   basis   in   any   indebtedness   of the corporation   to   the   shareholder.   Losses   disallowed   because   of   an inadequate   basis   may   be   carried   forward   indefinitely   and   treated   as   a loss in any   subsequent   year   in which   the shareholder   has a basis in either  stock   or   debt.166   A special   rule   also   provides   that   if a shareholder’s   stock is transferred   under   Section   1041   to a spouse   or   former   spouse   incident to   a   divorce,   any   suspended   loss   or   deduction   may   be   carried   forward  indefinitely by the transferee-spouse.167   As illustrated   by the Harris   case, which   follows   this   Note,   one   of the   most   litigated   issues   to   arise   under  Subchapter   S has   involved   the   determination   of a shareholder’s   basis   in S corporation   stock   and   debt   for   purposes   of applying   the   general   loss limitation   rules   in Section   1366(d).  Losses that pass through to a shareholder of an S corporation also may be restricted by the at-risk limitations in Section 465,   the passive  activity loss limitations in Section 469, and the Section 461(J) limitation  on excess business losses   of noncorporate taxpayers.168 The at-risk   rules are applied on an   activity-by-activity basis, except that activities  constituting a trade or business   generally are aggregated if the taxpayer  actively participates in the management of the trade or business   and at least 65 percent of the losses   are allocable to persons actively engaged in  the management of the   trade or business.169 The passive activity loss  limitations cast a wider net and may delay an   investor's   ability to deduct legitimate   start-up losses passing through   from a new business   operating  as an S  corporation   unless the  investor also materially   participates in the activity.!70 Finally, S  corporation losses   that   survive after application of  Sections   465 and 469 are subject to the  Section 461(/) limitation on  excess  business losses   of noncorporate   taxpayers. An “excess business loss” is  generally   defined as a net loss from all of  the taxpayer’s   trade or business  activities   in excess of $250,000, or $500,000 in the   case   of a joint  166 L.R.C. §§  1366(d)(2)(A);   1366(a)(1). 167 .R.C.   § 1366(d)(2)(B).  168 These   limitations   apply on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis rather th  corporate level.

BASIS OF S CORPORATION DEBT TO   A SHAREHOLDER  For purposes of the Section   1366(d) loss limitations, the regulations  provide   general guidance on how to determine the   basis of an S corporation’s indebtedness to its shareholders. Shareholders only  obtain basis in S corporation debt if it is “bona fide,” a determination made  under general tax principles and   based on all the facts and circumstances.174 Relevant factors under the extensive case law include evidence of intent to make a loan (e.g., proper documentation and  adherence to a payment schedule), objective indicia   of indebtedness,   and  economic reality (e.g., whether a third party   lender would loan money under similar circumstances). These general principles are given further signs of life through   examples applying the bona fide indebtedness test to situations where there is  a loan directly from a shareholder to an S corporation; a back-to-back loan arrangement where one S corporation  makes a loan to a shareholder   and the shareholder then makes a loan to a different S corporation; and a loan restructuring where an individual  who is the sole shareholder of two S corporations receives the loan of one  corporation to the other in a distribution.175  A different   but frequently   litigated issue   is whether   an   S corporation shareholder   obtains   basis   credit   as   a result   of guaranteeing   a debt   of the  corporation.   That   issue   is addressed   in the   Harris   case,   below,   and   the  Note   that   follows   the case.  Harris   v.

698 TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  fifteen to twenty years.! Shortly before this time, Taxpayers had contacted John   Smith (Smith), a real estate loan officer with Hibernia National Bank (Hibernia), to discuss the   possibility of obtaining financing for the impending acquisition. Smith orally committed to lend |  Taxpayers   $700,000.  Subsequently,   to   shield   themselves   from   the   potential   adverse publicity   that could follow from   the purchase   of the pornographic   theater, as   well   as   to limit   their   personal   liability   and   enhance   their   chances   of qualifying   for   industrial   revenue   bonds   to   finance   the   theater’s renovation,   in   July   1982   Taxpayers   formed   Harmar   (Harmar),   a  Louisiana   corporation,   which   elected   to be taxed   pursuant   to Subchapter  S   of the   Internal   Revenue   Code,   to   purchase   and   operate   the   subject property.   Harris   and   Martin   each   initially   contributed   $1,000   to   the  corporation,   receiving   its stock   in return,   and   each   also   loaned   Harmar  $47,500   to satisfy   operating   expenses.   Harris   and   Martin   were   the   sole  shareholders   of Harmar,   each   owning   half of its stock.  The   purchase   of the   theater   closed   on   November   1, 1982,   and   the theater   was   conveyed   to   Harmar   on   that   date.   Hibernia   furnished   the  $700,000   necessary   to   close   the   transaction.   In   borrowing   the   funds  necessary   to   acquire   the   subject   property,   Harmar   executed   two  promissory   notes   payable   to   Hibernia   for   $350,000   each,   each   dated  November   1,   1982.   One   of   these   notes   was   secured   by   a   $50,322.09  Hibernia   certificate   of deposit   in Harris’   name   and   another   $304,972.49  certificate   of deposit   in the name   of his wholly-owned   corporation,   Harris Mortgage   Corporation.   Harmar   secured   the   other   note,   in   accordance  with   its collateral   pledge   agreement,   by its   $3,000,000   note   (which   was  unfunded   apart   from   the   $700,000)   and   its   collateral   mortgage   on   the  theater,   each   executed   by   Harmar   in   favor   of   Hibernia   and   dated  November   1, 1982.   Under   the   terms   of the   collateral   pledge   agreement  executed   by Harmar   in reference   to   the   $3,000,000   note   and   mortgage,  the   mortgage   secured   “not   only”   Harmar’s   $350,000   note   to   Hibernia, “but   also   any   and   every   other   debts,   liabilities   and   obligations”   (other  than   consumer   credit   debt)   of Harmar   to   Hibernia   whether   “due   or   to become   due, or whether   such   debts,   liabilities   and   obligations”   of Harmar  “are   now   existing   or   will   arise   in   the   future.”   Thus,   the   collateral  mortgage   secured   the   full   $700,000   loan   from   Hibernia.   Additionally,  Taxpayers   each   executed   personal   continuing   guarantees   of   Harmar  indebtedness   in   the   amount   of   $700,000   in   favor   of   Hibernia.   Smith  testified in his deposition   that the transaction   was   structured   so that half the loan,   as represented   by one   of the $350,000   notes,   would   be primarily  secured   by the   certificates   of deposit   and   the   other   half,   represented   by  As part   of  the contract, Taxpayers deposited   with   the seller $32,500, all of which   was  to be applied to the purchase price.   In the  event Taxpayers   were   unable to procure   the loan, the  purchase   contract   called   for  their   deposit to be  refunded.  2 ; Smith   asserted in   his deposition   that   he   did   not know the   purpose of  the borrowed  funds in excess   of  the purchase price,   but   he   surmised   that   the money   was   intended for  improvements to the theater.   No   written   loan commitment   was   ever   issued.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  the other $350,000 note, primarily by the mortgage on the property  purchased, with the entire amount also secured by Taxpayers’ individual  guarantees.  On its income tax return for the year ending December 31, 1982, Harmar reported a net operating loss of $104,013. Pursuant to [the predecessor of Section 1366], Taxpayers each claimed half of the loss as  a deduction on   their 1982   individual returns,® concluding that their bases  in Harmar were in fact greater than Harmar’s net operating loss  for that  year and that they therefore were entitled to deduct the entire loss on  their personal returns. On audit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  found to the contrary and determined that Harris and Martin each had  a basis of $1,000 in his Harmar stock and an adjusted basis in Harmar’s  indebtedness to each of them as shareholders of $47,500. Pursuant to  I.R.C.   [§ 1366(d)], the IRS limited Taxpayers’ deductions of the   net operating loss to what it considered to be their bases in Harmar, $48,500  each. The IRS’s disallowance of a portion of the deductions   claimed by  Taxpayers® resulted in additional tax liability, including interest, for Martin of $3,150.58 and for Harris of $1,280. Taxpayers paid the tax in dispute and now appeal the district court’s summary judgment dismissing their suit   for refund.  Discussion  Taxpayers   contend   on   appeal   that   in   determining   the   deduction  allowable   for Harmar’s   net   operating   loss, the   IRS   should   have   included in Taxpayers’   bases   in their   Harmar   stock   the full value   of the   $700,000 Hibernia   loan   they   guaranteed.   I.R.C.   [§ 1366]   permits   a   Subchapter   S  shareholder   to deduct   from   his personal   return   a proportionate   share   of his   corporation’s   net   operating   loss   to the   extent   that   the   loss   does   not exceed   the   sum   of the   adjusted   basis   of his   Subchapter   S corporation  stock   and   any   corporate   indebtedness   to him.   See   section   [1366(d)(1)].   To  arrive   at   their   basis   figure,   Taxpayers   seek   to recast   the   transaction   in  question.   They in essence   urge   that we   disregard   the form   of the Hibernia  loan—one   from   Hibernia   to   Harmar—in   favor   of   what   Taxpayers  consider   as   the   substance   of   the   transaction—a   $700,000   loan   from  Hibernia   to   them,   the   $700,000   proceeds   of which   they   then   equally  contributed   to Harmar’s   capital   account.   As   evidence   of their view   of the substance   of the transaction,   Taxpayers   point to the deposition   testimony  of Smith   indicating   that   Hibernia   looked   primarily   to Taxpayers,   rather  than   to Harmar,   for repayment   of the loan,   and   they call attention   to the $700,000   guarantees   they   each   provided   Hibernia   as   well   as   the $355,294.58   in certificates   of deposit   that   Harris   pledged   to Hibernia   as part   of the   November   1, 1982   loan   transaction.  In its summary   judgment   memorandum, the   district   court   declared  that Brown v. Commissioner,   706   F.2d   755   (6th   Cir.1983),   was   “on all  5 Harris   and   Martin   claimed   deductions for Harmar’s loss   of $52,006   and   $52,007,  respectively.   ats He  6 The   IRS   disallowed   $4,506   of Harris’   deduction   and   $4,507   of  Martin’s.  699

700___‘Taxavion or§ConPoraTions ___SESSEBEDS  fours”   with   the instant   case   and   therefore   resolved   it. In Brown,   the   Sixth  Circuit   rejected   shareholders’   substance   over   form   argument   in   ruling  that   the   shareholders’   guarantees   of   loans   to   their   Subchapter   S  corporation   could   not   increase   their   bases   in   their   stock   in   the corporation   unless   the   shareholders   made   an   economic   outlay   by  satisfying   at least   a portion   of the   guaranteed   debt.   Id.   at   757.   Without such   an   outlay,   the Brown   court   concluded   that   “ ‘the substance   matched  the form’   ” of the transaction   before   it. Id. at 756.   The   reasoning   of Brown  was   followed   by the   Fourth   Circuit   in Estate   of Leavitt   v.   Commissioner,  875   F.2d   420   (4th   Cir.1989),   aff'g,   90   T.C.   206   (1988).   There,   the   court,  affirming   the   en   banc   Tax   Court,   held   that   shareholder   guarantees   of a  loan   to a Subchapter   S corporation   did   not   increase   shareholders’   stock basis   because   such   guarantees   had   not   “cost”   shareholders   anything   and  thus   did not   constitute   an   economic   outlay.   Leavitt,   875   F.2d   at 422   &   n.  9.7 In reaching   this conclusion,   the Fourth   Circuit   affirmed   as not clearly  erroneous   a finding   of the   Tax   Court   that   the   loan,   in form   as   well   as   in substance,   was   made   to the corporation   rather   than   to the shareholders.® Id.   at   424.   The   court   rejected   appellants’   suggestion   that   it employ   the  debt/equity   principles   espoused   in   Plantation   Patterns,   Inc.   v.  Commissioner,   462   F.2d   712   (5th   Cir.1972),   in determining   whether   the  shareholders   had   actually   made   an   economic   outlay,?   instead   choosing   to  employ   a   debt/equity   analysis   only   after   making   a   finding   that   an  economic   outlay   had   occurred.   Leavitt,   875   F.2d   at 427.   The   Leavitt   court  reasoned   that   the   legislative   history   of section   [1366]   limiting   the   basis  of a Subchapter   S shareholder   to his corporate   investment   or outlay could not be circumvented   through   the use   of debt/equity   principles.   Id. at 426  &   n.   16.   See   generally   Bogdanski,   Shareholder   Guarantees,   Interest  Deductions,   and   S Corporation   Stock   Basis:   The   Problems   with   Putnam, 13 J.Corp.Tax’n   264,   268-89   (1986). Taxpayers press this Court to follow   the contrary   holding of Selfe v.  United States, 778   F.2d   769   (11th   Cir.1985). There, the Eleventh Circuit  ruled   that a shareholder’s guaranty of a Subchapter   S corporation loan  could result   in   an increase in equity or debt   basis even though the  7 In reasoning that   the shareholders   had not increased their   stock bases as a result   of  their guarantees, the   court turned to LR.C. § 1012, which defines   basis of property as its cost.  Id. at 422 n. 9. Cost of property, in turn, is defined in the Treasury   Regulations as the “amount  paid for such   property in cash or other   property.”   26   C.F.R. § 1.1012—1(a).  8 The court noted that   the   loan in question   had   been made by the bank directly to the  corporation, the loan payments were made by the corporation directly to the bank,   and neither the corporation nor   the shareholders   reported the payments as constructive   dividends. Id.  Under Leavitt,   the presumption is that   the form will control and that presumption will not  be surmounted absent the shareholder’s   satisfying   the higher   standard applicable to   a  taxpayer’s   seeking to disavow the form   he   selected and recast a transaction.   See   Bowers, Building Up an S Shareholder’s   Basis through   Loans   and Acquisiti : eee g   cquisitions, J. Tax’n   S Corp.,   Fall  ° In Plantation   Patterns, this Court   considered   whether a Subchapter   C   corporation  could  deduct interest payments   made on its debt   and   whether its shareholders   had   resulting dividend income. The   Court,   using a debt/equity   analysis,   affirmed a Tax   Court   finding   that a corporation's   interest payments on debentures   were   constructive   dividends   and   could   not   be  deducted as  interest   payments. Id.  at 723-24, *  *  *

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  shareholder   had not satisfied any portion of the   obligation. Selfe, 778 F.2d at 775. The court remanded the case to the district court for it to  employ debt/equity principles in determining if the loan in question was  in substance one to the shareholder rather than to the corporation. Id.  The courts have   uniformly ruled that a shareholder must make an  economic outlay to increase his Subchapter S corporation stock basis.  Taxpayers assert   that if we look beyond the form of the transaction at  what they contend is its substance—a loan from   Hibernia to them, which  in turn they   contributed to Harmar as capital—we must find that a  $700,000 outlay occurred and that their stock bases therefore  correspondingly increased. They contend that use of debt/equity principles will lead us to such a conclusion. Ordinarily,   taxpayers   are   bound   by the   form   of the   transaction   they have   chosen;   taxpayers   may   not   in hindsight   recast   the   transaction   as one   that   they   might   have   made   in order   to obtain   tax   advantages.   * * * The   IRS,   however,   often   may   disregard   form   and   recharacterize   a transaction   by looking   to its substance.   Higgins   v.   Smith,   308   U.S.   473, 60   S.Ct.   355,   357,   84 L.Ed.   406   (1940).   The   Tax   Court   has   recognized   an exception   to   the   rule   that   a   taxpayer   may   not   question   a   transaction’s  form   in   cases   such   as   this   one   in   which   the   shareholder   argues   that  guaranteed   corporate   debt   should   be   recast   as   an   equity   investment   on the   shareholder’s   part.   Blum   v.   Commissioner,   59 T.C.   486,   440   (1972).  In   this   case   we   find   that   the   transaction   as   structured   did   not   lack  adequate   substance   or reality   and   that   an   economic   outlay justifying   the  basis   claimed   by Taxpayers   never   occurred.  The   summary   judgment   evidence   reflects   that   the   parties   to   this transaction   intended   that   the   Hibernia   loan   be   one   to   the   corporation.  Each   of the   two   $350,000   promissory   notes   was   executed   by and   only   in  the   name   of Harmar.   The   notes   have   been   renewed   and   remain   in the same   form,   namely   notes   payable   to Hibernia   in which   the   sole   maker   is  Harmar.   Hibernia,   an   independent   party,   in   substance   earmarked   the  loan proceeds   for use   in purchasing   the subject property   to which   Harmar  took   title,   Harmar   contemporaneously   giving   Hibernia   a   mortgage   to  secure   Harmar’s   debt   to Hibernia.   The   bank   sent   interest   due   notices   to Harmar,   and   all note   payments   were   made   by checks   to Hibernia   drawn  on   Harmar’s   corporate   account.   Harmar’s   books   and   records   for all years  through   the   year   ended   December   31,   1985,   prepared   by   its   certified  public   accountant,   reflect   the   $700,000   loan   simply   as an   indebtedness   of  Harmar   to Hibernia.   They   do not   in any   way   account   for or reflect   any   of  the   $700,000   as   a capital   contribution   or   loan   by Taxpayers   to Harmar,  although   they   do   reflect   the   $1,000   capital   contribution   each   Taxpayer  made   and   Harmar’s   indebtedness   to   Taxpayers   for   the   various   cash  advances   Taxpayers   made   to it. The   Harmar   financial   statements   for the year   ended   December   31,   1986,   are   the   first   to   show   any   contributed  capital   attributable   to   the   Hibernia   loan.   Further,   Hibernia’s   records  showed   Harmar   as the “borrower”   in respect   to the   $700,000   loan   and   the  701

--- Page 772 ---

702  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  renewals of it. Harmar’s 1982 tax return, which covered August 15 through December 31, 1982, indicates   that Harmar deducted   $12,506 in  interest expenses. Because only the Hibernia loan generated such  expenses for that period, it is reasonably inferable   that   the deduction  corresponded to that loan. The 1982 Harmar return showed no — distribution to Taxpayers, as it should have if the $700,000   Hibernia loan  on which Harmar paid interest was a loan to the Taxpayers. Further, the  return shows the only capital contributed as $2,000 and the only loan  from stockholders as $68,000,   but shows other indebtedness of $675,000.  In short, Harmar’s 1982 income tax return is flatly inconsistent   with Taxpayers’ present position. Moreover, there is no indication that  Taxpayers treated the loan as a personal one on   their individual   returns  by reporting Harmar’s interest payments to Hibernia as constructive  dividend   income. In sum, the parties’ treatment of the transaction, from  the time it was   entered into and for years thereafter, has been   wholly  consistent with its unambiguous documentation and inconsistent   with  the way in which Taxpayers   now seek to recast it. Hibernia   was clearly an independent third   party, and the real and   bona fide, separate existence of Harmar is not challenged. The parties did what they intended to do, and the transaction as structured did   not   lack adequate reality or substance.  Moreover, if the transaction is  to be “recast,” it is by no means clear  that it should be recast in the form   sought by  Taxpayers, namely as   a cash loan to them from   Hibernia followed by their payment of the cash to  Harmar as  a contribution to its capital, and Harmar’s then   using the cash  to purchase the building. Such recasting   does not account for Hibernia’s mortgage on the  building.   In any event, if the transaction is to be recast,  why should it not be recast as   a loan by  Hibernia to Taxpayers, with the  Taxpayers using the funds to themselves   purchase the   building,   giving  Hibernia a mortgage on the building to secure their debt to it, and then transferring the   building,   subject to the mortgage, to Harmar as a contribution to capital? Presumably in that   situation Taxpayers’ bases in  their Harmar stock would be reduced   by the amount of the   debt secured  by the mortgage   under I.R.C. § 358(d). See Wiebusch v. Commissioner, 59   T.C.   777,   affd   per curiam “on   the   basis of the opinion of the Tax Court,” Wiebusch v. Commissioner, 487   F.2d   515 (8th   Cir.1973).15 While section   358(d) likely does   not affect stockholder basis in the   debt of the Subchapter   S  corporation to the   stockholder, Taxpayers   have not sought to recast   the transaction as   a loan by  Hibernia to them followed by their loan of  the proceeds to Harmar; indeed   even after Harmar’s   books   were  rearranged starting   with   the   year ending December 31, 1986,   the   books  8 See also Megaard,   No Stock   Basis for Shareholder   Guarantee of S Corporation   Debt  ile J.Corp.Tax’n   340 (1989). Megaard explains   that   “[ujnder   Section   358(d),   the assumption by  a corporation of its shareholder’s   debt is treated as money received which   reduces the  shareholder’s   basis   in   the   stock.” Id.   at   349.   Cf. id. at 350   (“Having the   corporation’s   assets  encumbered   by the  shareholder’s   personal   debt   runs   the  risk of a basis  reduction   under   Section  358   should   the  Service   argue   that the  transaction   was a purchase   by the  shareholder of  the *  * * assets   followed   by a contribution   of  the   assets   to  the   corporation   subject   to  the   debt.”).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS 703  do not show any indebtedness in this respect of Harmar to Taxpayers and  do continue to show Harmar as owing the money in question to Hibernia.  There is simply no evidence of Harmar indebtedness to Taxpayers in  respect to these funds.  Taxpayers’   guarantees and Harris’ pledge of  certificates   of deposit do not undermine the  intent of the  parties   that Harmar be the borrower in this transaction. It certainly is not difficult to fathom that a careful  lender to a new, small, closely held corporation   such as Harmar would  seek personal guarantees from all of its shareholders. See Bogdanski,  supra, at 269. Moreover, the wholly unperformed guarantees do not satisfy the requirement that an economic outlay   be made before a corresponding increase in basis   can occur. See   generally Underwood, 535  F.2d at 312. In   the same light, Harris’ pledge to Hibernia of some $355,000 in   certificates of deposit of   his (and   Harris Mortgage Corporation) does not provide   such an   outlay.16 We   conclude   that   the   transaction   must   be   treated   as   it purports   to  be   and   as   the   parties   treated   it—namely   as   a   loan   by   Hibernia   to Harmar,   all   payments   on   which   through   the   relevant   time   have   been  made   by Harmar   to Hibernia.   For   any   funds   or   other   assets   Taxpayers  have   actually   provided   to   Harmar   as   loans   or   contributions,   Taxpayers are,   of course,   entitled   to basis   additions   as of the time   such   contributions or   loans   were   furnished   by them   to Harmar,   but   they   are   not   entitled   to  a   1982   basis   addition   for   Hibernia’s   1982   $700,000   loan   to   Harmar,  notwithstanding   that   it was   also   secured   by   Taxpayers’   execution   of  guarantees   and   Harris’   pledge   to   Hibernia   of his   and   Harris   Mortgage  Corporation’s   certificates   of deposit   in   the   total   face   amount   of some  $355,000.  Conclusion  There   was no genuine dispute as to any   material fact necessary to sustain the Government’s summary judgment motion. The district  court’s judgment is correct and it is therefore  Affirmed.  NOTE  In  Harris,   the   Fifth   Circuit   joined   several   other circuits!”* and the Tax Court!77 in holding that   the guarantee of   an S corporation’s   loan by its shareholders may not   be   treated as an   additional investment in   the  16 Taxpayers   would   have us, in effect, convert this pledge to Hibernia into a $700,000 cash  contribution made to Harmar by  Taxpayers equally. But that   did not happen. Taxpayers do  not contend that   the  certificates   of  deposit   were   contributed to Harmar’s capital.  176 See, e.g., Brown v. Commissioner, 706   F.2d   755   (6th   Cir.1983);   Estate of Leavitt   v. Commissioner, 875   F.2d   420   (4th Cir.1989), cert. denied,   493   U.S. 958,  110 S.Ct. 376   (1989);   Uri v.

704   TAXATION   OF   S CORPORATIONS   PART   3  corporation   which   will   increase   the   shareholders’   bases   for purposes   of the  loss limitation   rule   in Section   1366(d).   In conflict   with   this   line   of authority is the   Eleventh   Circuit’s   decision   in Selfe   v.   United   States.178   In   Selfe,   the court   reasoned   that   debt-equity   principles   under   Subchapter   C   were applicable   in determining   whether   a shareholder-guaranteed   debt   should   be   ~  characterized   as   a   capital   contribution.   In   remanding   the   case   for   a  determination   of whether   the   shareholder’s   guarantee   amounted   to   either  an   equity   investment   or   a   shareholder   loan   to   the   corporation,   the   court  directed   the   district   court   to apply   the   principles   of Plantation   Patterns,   a  Subchapter   C case   discussed   in Harris.   Despite   the   seeming   conflict   among  the   circuits,   the   Supreme   Court   has   resisted   the   temptation   to   add   this  fascinating   tax   issue   to its docket.179  The   regulations   now   confirm   the   majority   rule   as   articulated   in Harris.  They   provide   that   a shareholder   does   not   obtain   basis   credit   in indebtedness  of an   S corporation   merely   by   guaranteeing   a   loan,   or   acting   as   a   surety,  accommodation   party,   or in some   similar   capacity   relating   to a loan.   But   ifa  shareholder   is   called   upon   to   make   a   payment   on   the   corporation’s  indebtedness   as   a   result   of a   guaranty   or   similar   arrangement,   then   the  shareholder   may   increase   the   basis   of indebtedness   to   the   extent   of the amount   of the payment. !80  c. SUBCHAPTER S PRECONTRIBUTION LOSSES  AND SECTION 362(e)(2)  Code: § 362(e)(2). The rules for allocating and   characterizing gains and losses that are inherent in property   contributed to a partnership (“precontribution   gains and losses”) are one of the principal   features of the Subchapter K partnership tax regime. Under Section 704(c)(1)(A), precontribution gains and losses generally must be taxed to the contributing partner, and  Section   724 prevents   partners   from   gaining a tax advantage   by  converting   precontribution   ordinary income into capital gain and precontribution capital loss into ordinary loss. Other provisions   buttress  these rules by   preventing shifting of precontribution gains and losses through   partnership distributions and dispositions of partnership interests.181   In  short, Subchapter K has an array of provisions designed  to ensure that a partner who contributes   property   with a precontribution  gain will be  taxed on that gain and that precontribution losses may not  be  shifted to other partners. 182  Subchapter   S is relatively primitive compared to   its Subchapter K cousin in the treatment of precontribution   gains and losses. Under Section   1377, precontribution   gains and losses   are taxed like any   other  178 778   F.2d   769   (11th   Cir.1985).  179 The   Cour t denied the   taxpayer's iti i   i e Estat Oj L petition   for certiorari in th (23 Leavitt case,  180 Reg. § 1.1366—2(a)(2)(ii).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  gain or loss under a_ per-share, per-day allocation method.183  Precontribution gains and losses in an S corporation are thus   routinely  shifted to other shareholders. Congress decided to attack various schemes   by taxpayers to  duplicate losses by way of transactions   involving corporations.   Section  362(e)(2) was one of the provisions enacted to curb   those   abuses. That  section provides that if   a shareholder transfers property with an aggregate built-in loss to a corporation in a Section   351   transaction, the  corporation’s basis in the property must be reduced to the fair market  value of such property.184 If more   than one asset is contributed, the  basis  reduction is allocated among the property in proportion to their respective built-in   losses immediately before   the   transaction.185 As an  alternative to reducing the property’s basis, the shareholder   and the  corporation may elect to reduce the   basis of the   stock   that was received for the property to the stock’s fair market value immediately after the  transfer. 186  Section   362(e)(2)   potentially   will defer   or limit precontribution   losses  in   an   S   corporation,   sometimes   in   a   very   unusual   way.   For   example,  assume   that   an   individual   decides   to   form   an   S   corporation   by  contributing   property   with   a $20,000   basis   and   $12,000   fair market   value for all of the corporation’s   stock in a Section   351   exchange.   Under   Section  362(e)(2),   the   property’s   basis   will   be   reduced   to   $12,000   and   the precontribution   loss   in   the   property   will   disappear.   If the   corporation  were   to   sell   the   property   for   $12,000,   there   would   be   no   gain   or   loss recognized   by   the   corporation.   The   shareholder’s   basis   in   the   stock,  however,   would   still be   $20,000   so   the   loss   would   remain   in the   shares.  The   timing   of the   loss, however,   would   be deferred   until   the shareholder  either   liquidates   the   corporation   or sells the   stock.   Alternatively,   assume that   the   shareholder   and   the   corporation   elect   to reduce   the   basis   of the  shareholder’s   stock   to   $12,000.   In that   case,   the   basis   of the   property   in  the   corporation   would   remain   at $20,000.   If the   corporation   were   to sell the property,   it would   recognize   its $8,000   loss, which   would   pass   through to the   shareholder.   The   shareholder’s   stock   basis   would   then   be reduced  by the loss   down   to $4,000,   putting   the   shareholder   in a position   where   a  sale   of the   stock   for   its   $12,000   fair   market   value   would   result   in   an  $8,000   gain.   Over   time,   the   shareholder   would   report   an   $8,000   loss   and  an   $8,000   gain, the net result being that the loss essentially   disappeared.  Finally,   assume   that   the   shareholder   also   contributed   property   with   a  $10,000   built-in   gain to the S corporation   at the same   time   as the transfer  of the   property   with   the   built-in   loss.   In that   case,   no   reduction   in   the  basis   of the   loss   property   or   the   stock   would   be   required   under   Section 188 The   regulations   hold   out   the   possibility   of attacking   plans to   alter   the   character of precontribution   gains   and losses   in  an S  corporation.   See   Reg. § 1.1366—1(b)(2) & (8).  184   T.R.C.   § 362(e)(2)(A). 185 T.R.C. § 362(e)(2)(B). 186 T.R.C.   §  362(e)(2)(C).  705

706  Daeeaatt  iA   \   [it  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  362(e)(2) because the two   properties that were   transferred did not have  an aggregate built-in loss.  It   is   hard   to   believe   that   Congress   considered   the   effects   on Subchapter   S when   it enacted   Section   362(e)(2).   That   section   now   lurks   | as   a trap   for those   who   either   receive   poor   advice   or   are   not   initiated   in the   ways   of Subchapters   C   and   S.   Until   Congress   fixes   this   problem,  taxpayers   planning   a new   venture   involving   property   with   a built-in   loss  will   be   well   advised   to   consider   structuring   the   venture   as   a   limited liability   company   or   partnership   governed   by   Subchapter   K.  Alternatively,   another   strategy   for preserving   a built-in   loss   in property  would   be   to   offer   to   make   the   property   available   to   an   S   corporation  through   a leasing   arrangement.

SALE OF S CORPORATION   STOCK  Code: § 1(h).  The tax consequences of a sale  of S  corporation stock are determined  by regulations promulgated   under the “look-through” rules   of Section 1(h).  In   general, S  corporation stock is treated as   a capital   asset   that gives rise   to capital   gain or loss   on sale. Unlike the more   complex  approach   taken   by   Subchapter K to the   sale   of a partnership interest  Subchapter   S historically   has not required selling shareholders to  characterize a portion   of their gain or  loss   on a stock   sale by  reference to  the   types of   assets (e.g., ordinary   income   property)   held by the  corporation at  the   time   of  the sale. When   Congress   enacted   the   Section 1(h)   capital   gains   rate   regime,   however, it authorized   the   Service   to

--- Page 777 ---

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS   7107  prescribe appropriate regulations to apply the various maximum capital gains rates to the sale   of interests in pass-through entities. 187  The Section 1(h) regulations   apply a partial   capital gains “look-  through” rule for sales and exchanges of interests in an S corporation.188  Shareholders who sell S corporation stock held for more than one year  may recognize collectibles gain (taxable at a maximum rate   of 28 percent)  and residual capital gain, which is generally taxable at a maximum rate  of 20   percent,189 The selling shareholder’s share of  collectibles gain is defined as the amount of the net collectibles gain (but  not net collectibles  loss) that would be   allocated to that shareholder if the S corporation  transferred all of its collectibles in a fully taxable transaction  immediately before the transfer of the stock.19° The selling shareholder’s  residual capital gain is the amount of long-term capital gain or loss that the shareholder   would recognize on the sale   of the   stock (“pre-look- through capital gain or loss”) minus the shareholder’s share of collectibles   gain.191 The   look-through rules do not extend to other  corporate assets, such as inventory or depreciable equipment, that would generate   ordinary   income, or to real estate   that would   produce unrecaptured (i.e., 25-percent) Section 1250   gain on a corporate-level sale. In   contrast, on the sale   of a partnership interest, the portion of consideration received by a partner that is attributable to ordinary  income assets is taxed to the selling partner as ordinary income.!92 What  is the   policy   justification for this more limited “pick and choose” look-  through   approach for S corporations? The   regulations   illustrate   these   rules   with   the   following   example.1%  Assume   that   X,   Inc.,   which   always   has   been   an   S   corporation   and   is  owned   equally   by individuals   A, B, and   C, invests   in antiques.   After   they  were   purchased,   the antiques   appreciated   in value   by $300.   A owned   one-  third   of the   X   stock   and   has   held   the   stock   for   more   than   one   year.   A’s adjusted   basis   in the X stock   is $100.   If A were   to sell all of the X stock   to  T for   $150,   A would   recognize   $50   of pre-look-through   long-term   capital  gain.   If X   were   to   sell   all of the   antiques   in a fully taxable   transaction  immediately   before   the   transfer   to   T,   A   would   be   allocated   $100   of  collectibles   gain   on   account   of the   sale.   Therefore,   A will recognize   $100 of collectibles   gain on   account   of the collectibles   held by X. The   difference  between   A’s   pre-look-through   capital   gain   or   loss   ($50)   and   the  collectibles   gain   ($100)   is A’s   residual   long-term   capital   gain   or   loss   on  187   T.R.C.   § 1(h)(9).  =   188   Reg.   § 1.1(h)-1.  189 Reg. § 1.1(h)-1(a).   In   limited   situations (e.g., where a transaction is governed   by provisions of Subchapter   C that  treat gain on a sale or redemption of stock as  ordinary   income),  shareholders also may recognize   ordinary   income on a sale  of their S  corporation stock.   See, e.g.,  L.R.C. §§  304,   306. Pe  190 Reg. § 1.1(h)—1(b)(2)(a1). A shareholder’s   share of collectibles gain is limited to the  amount attributable to the  portion of  the stock  transferred   that  was   held for more   than  one   year.  191   Reg.   § 1.1(h)—1(c).  192   T.R.C.   § 741.  193   Reg.   § 1.1(h)-1(f)   Example   4.

DISTRIBUTIONS   TO   SHAREHOLDERS  Code:   §§ 311(b);   1868;   1371(a)(1),   (c), (e); Skim   § 301(a),   (b) &   (d). S Corporations   Without   Earnings   and Profits.   If an   S corporation   has no   accumulated   earnings   and   profits,   distributions   to   shareholders   are  treated   as   a tax-free   return   of capital   which   is first   applied   to reduce   the  shareholder’s   stock   basis.194   Any   distribution   in excess   of basis   is treated as   gain from   the   sale or exchange   of property—capital   gain if the   stock   is  a capital   asset.19   Virtually   all S corporations   formed   after   1982   do   not  generate   earnings   and   profits!96   and   are   governed   by this   simple   regime. This   basic   taxing   pattern   for distributions   by S corporations   also   governs  any   distribution   of property   to which   Section   301(c)   would   apply.197   Thus, the   tax   consequences   of   transactions   characterized   as   Section   301  distributions   by   other   Code   provisions,   such   as   Sections   302  (redemptions)   and   305   (stock   dividends),   are   determined   under   Section  1368.  S   Corporations   with   Earnings   and   Profits.   S   corporations   with earnings   and   profits   present   more   challenging   problems   because   of the need   to harmonize   the   Subchapter S rules   with   the   corporation’s   prior   C  history.   Distributions   by a C corporation   to its shareholders   are   taxable  as   dividends   to the   extent   of the   corporation’s   current   and   accumulated  earnings   and   profits.198   Some   S   corporations   may   have   accumulated  earnings   and   profits   attributable   to prior years   when   they were   governed by Subchapter   C.   In   addition,   an   S corporation   may   have   inherited   the  earnings   and   profits   of   another   company   in   a   corporate   acquisition  subject to Section   381.   In all these   cases,   the undistributed   earnings   have  not   been   taxed   at   the   shareholder   level   and   represent   an   irresistible  temptation   for a tax-free   bailout.   There   is no   free   lunch,   however,   and   it  thus   becomes   necessary   to identify   those   distributions   which   should   be  taxed   at the shareholder   level because   they   are   made   out   of accumulated  earnings   and   profits.  Congress devised a new tax concept—the   “accumulated   adjustments  account” (“AAA”)—to serve as the reference   point for determining the source of distributions by an S  corporation   with accumulated earnings and profits. The AAA represents the post-1982   undistributed net income  of   the   corporation. It begins at   zero and is increased   and   decreased annually in a manner similar to the adjustment of   the   basis   in a  194   T.R.C.   § 1868(b)(1). 195   E.R.C.   § 1368(b)(2).  ip TRIC. § 1371(¢)(1).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  shareholder’s stock.199 Any distribution by an S corporation with  accumulated earnings   and profits is treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent it does not exceed the AAA.200 A distribution in excess of the  AAA is treated as a dividend to the extent of accumulated earnings   and  profits,2°! and any portion of the distribution still remaining after both  the AAA and accumulated earnings   and profits are exhausied is treated  first as a recovery of basis and then as gain from the sale of property.202  One might reasonably ask at this point: what is the purpose of this  statutory scheme? The   answer is more   straightforward   than it first  appears. The function of the AAA is to identify  the source of distributions by those few S corporations with accumulated earnings   and profits. It  permits the corporation to make a tax-free distribution of the net income  recognized   during its S corporation era which already   was taxed at the shareholder level. Only after these previously   taxed earnings are  exhausted will a distribution   be considered as emanating from  accumulated earnings   and profits.23  Distributions   of Appreciated   Property.   At   the   shareholder   level,   the  Section   1368   distribution   rules   make   no   distinction   between distributions   of cash   and   other   property.   At the corporate   level, however,  an   S   corporation   that   distributes   appreciated   property   (other   than   its  own   obligations)   recognizes   gain   in the   same   manner   as   if the   property  had   been   sold to the shareholder   at its fair market   value.2%   This   familiar  rule,   borrowed   from   Subchapter   C,   applies   to   liquidating   and nonliquidating   distributions   of property   by an   S corporation.2%   The   gain  is not   taxed   to   the   corporation   but,   like   other   corporate-level   income,   it  199   T.R.C.   § 1368(e)(1)(A);   Reg.   § 1.1368—2.   Unlike   a shareholder's   basis,   however,   the AAA is not   increased   by tax-exempt   income   items   and   is not   decreased   for expenses   related   to tax-  exempt   income.   The   Section   199A   deduction   for qualified   business   income   also   has   no   effect   on  the   AAA.   Reg.   § 1.199A-1(e)(1).   The   adjustments   also   may   result   in   a   negative   AAA.   Reg.  § 1.1368—-2(a)(3)(ii).   In   addition,   no   adjustment   is made   for   federal   taxes   attributable   to   any taxable   year   in which   the corporation   was   a C corporation.   Id.  200 T.R.C. § 1368(c)(1). Except to the extent provided in regulations, the AAA is allocated  proportionately among distributions if the  distributions exceed the AAA. See Reg. § 1. 1368—2(b),  (c).  201   T.R.C.   § 1368(c)(2).  202 T.R.C. § 1368(c)(2), (3). For   additional details about the AAA, see Reg. § 1.1368-2.  203 In lieu of these rules, an S corporation may elect, with   the consent of all shareholders  who have received   distributions during the   year, to treat distributions as   a dividend to the  extent of accumulated earnings   and profits.   I.R.C. § 1368(e)(3); Reg.   § 1.1368-1(f)(2). There  normally is little incentive to make this  election. One possible  motivation   would be to enable the  corporation to sweep its Subchapter   C earnings   and profits account clean and thus   avoid   the  corporate level   tax and possible termination of S  corporation status that would result  from the  co-existence of Subchapter   C earnings   and profits and excessive passive  investment   income. See LR.C. § 1375. A similar   election is provided   during a pest-termination transition   period.   I.R.C.  § 1371(e)(2). gre  204 T.R.C. § 311(b).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS   TAU  What are the tax consequences to Nancy,   Opal and P Corporation in the  following alternative situations.  (a) On November 1, P distributes $5,000 to Nancy and $5,000 to  Opal.  (b) Same as (a), above,   except that P distributes $10,000 to Nancy  and   $10,000 to Opal.  (c) What difference would it make in (a), above, if P also received  $4,000 of tax-exempt interest during the year and distributed  $2,000 of the   interest to Nancy and $2,000 to Opal?  (d)   During   the current   year   P makes   no   distributions.   On   January  1 of next   year   Nancy   sells   her   P stock   to Rose   for $6,000.   If P breaks   even   on   its operations   next   year,   what   will be the result  to Rose   if P distributes   $6,000   to each   of its shareholders   next  February   15?  (e)   During   the   current   year   P makes   no   distributions.   Nancy   and  Opal   revoke   P’s   Subchapter S   election   effective   January   1 of next   year.   Assume   P   Co.   has   $5,000   of earnings   and   profits  next   year.   What   results   to   Nancy   and   Opal   if P   distributes  $7,000   to each   of them   on   August   1 of next   year?  F.   TAXATION   OF   THE   S CORPORATION  Code:   §§ 1363;   1374;   1375.  The   major   benefit   of   a Subchapter S election   is the elimination   of tax  at the corporate   level.   But   this immunity   from   tax is not absolute.   As part of its continuing   mission   to patrol   abuse,   Congress   has   provided   that   in certain   limited   situations   an   S corporation   may   be   subject   to tax   under Section   1374   on   certain   built-in   gains   inherent   in corporate   property   and under   Section   1375   on   a portion   of its passive   investment   income. Tax on Certain Built-in Gains:   Section 1374. When Congress  repealed the General Utilities doctrine, it recognized that   the  shareholders of a C corporation might elect S  corporation status in order to avoid the corporate-level tax imposed   under the new statutory scheme.2°8   For example, assume Liquidating Co. is a C corporation,   holds  highly   appreciated assets, and is owned   by  shareholders A and B, who  also would realize   large   taxable   gains if they sell their   stock or liquidate  the company. If A and   B cause Liquidating Co. to sell   its assets and  liquidate, or   to distribute its assets   in complete liquidation, Liquidating  Co. will be  taxed on its gains   and A and B also  will be  taxed on   their  stock gains.209 If Liquidating Co.   qualified as   a “small   business   corporation,” A and   B could elect S  corporation   status   in order to reduce   the   double-tax  burden on   the   sale or liquidation. The   company then   could sell  its assets  and   the   gains   would   pass   through to A   and   B, whose stock   bases   would  oe SS ee   ee  208 See   Chapters   4D,   5E   and   7B2,   supra. 209 See   LR.C.   §§ 331;   336;   1001(a).

712  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  be correspondingly increased. The effect of the S corporation/liquidation  strategy would be to avoid the full impact of the double tax.  Section   1374   blocks   this opportunity   by taxing   an   S corporation   that has   a “net   recognized   built-in   gain”   at any   time   within   five   years   of the  effective   date   of its S corporation   election.?1©   At the outset,   two   important  limitations   on   this   tax   should   be noted.   First,   Section   1374   applies   only  if the   corporation’s   S   election   was   made   after   December   31,   1986.21!  Second,   it does   not apply to a corporation   that   always   has   been   subject   to Subchapter   S.?12  In general,   Section   1374   is designed   to tax   an   S corporation   on   the  net   gain that   accrued   while   it was   subject   to Subchapter   C if that   gain is  subsequently   recognized   on   sales,   distributions   and   other   dispositions   of property   within a five-year   “recognition   period”   beginning   with   the   first  taxable   year   in   which   the   corporation   was   an   S   corporation.   For   this  purpose,   any   gain   recognized   during   the   recognition   period,   including  income   from   “ripe”   items   such   as   cash-basis   accounts   receivable   or  Section   453   installment   obligations,   is a “recognized   built-in   gain” unless  the   corporation   establishes   either   that   it did   not   hold   the   asset   at   the beginning   of its first   S taxable   year   or   the   recognized   gain   exceeds   the  gain inherent   in the asset   at that time.?!3   Conversely,   any   loss recognized  during   the recognition   period,   including   deductible   items   attributable   to the   corporation’s   pre-S   life, is a   “recognized   built-in   loss”   to   the   extent that   the   S corporation   establishes   that   it held   the   asset   at the beginning  of its first   S year   and   the   loss   does   not   exceed   the   loss   inherent   in   the  asset   at that   time.?!4   Since   the   taxpayer   has   the   burden   of proof   under  these   definitions,   a C corporation   making   an S   election   should   obtain   an independent   appraisal   of   its   assets   to   establish   their   value   on   the relevant   date   in order   to avoid   being   taxed   on   gain   arising   under   the   S  regime   and   to   benefit   from   the   losses   that   accrued   during   the corporation’s   C years.  The Section 1374 tax is computed by applying the highest rate applicable to C corporations   (currently   the   21 percent flat rate) to the S corporation’s “net recognized built-in   gain,” which is defined as the  corporation’s   taxable income computed by taking into account   only recognized built-in gains and losses but   limited to the   corporation’s  “  210 -T.R.C. § 1374(a), (d)(7)(A). The “recognition   period”   was   temporarily   reduced   from ten  to seven   years and   then to  five years beginning in 2009   and permanently reduced to  five years  for taxable   years beginning in 2015. LR.C. § 1374(d)(7)(B), (C). The five-year time  period   applies  separately to any asset transferred   from a C to an S  corporation where the S  corporation   takes a carryover basis, such as in a tax-free reorganization. Id. See I.R.C. § 1374(d)(8). 11 Tax   Reform Act of  1986,   P.L.   No. 99-514,   99th   Cong.,   2d Sess. § 633(b)   (1986). 212 ‘TRC. § 1874(c)(1).   This exemption   may not   apply, however, if the S  corporation   had a  “predecessor”   that  was a C corporation. Id. This   could   occur,   for example,   where a C  corporation  was   acquired   by the S  corporation in a tax-free   reorganization.  718 L.R.C. § 1374(d)(3),   (5)(A). 214 1.R.C. §  1374(d)(4),   (5)(B).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS   713  taxable income computed generally as if it were a C corporation.?15 The  purpose of the taxable income limitation is to ensure that Section 1374  does not   tax the corporation on more income than it actually realizes during the taxable year. To   prevent   taxpayers from avoiding the tax by  manipulating the timing of post-conversion losses, Section   1374(d)(2)(B)  provides that any net recognized built-in gains not taxed because of the  taxable income limitation are carried forward   and treated as recognized  built-in gain in succeeding years in the recognition period.   Finally, the amount of  net recognized built-in gain taken into account for any taxable  year may not exceed the net unrealized built-in gain at the time the  corporation became an S corporation reduced by any net recognized built- in gains which were subject to Section 1374 in prior taxable years.?16 The   Section   1374   tax   easily   could   be   avoided   if it applied   only   to built-in   gains   recognized   on   the   disposition   of assets   that   were   held   by the S corporation   at the beginning   of its first S taxable   year.   For example,  assume   that   a   C   corporation   converting   to   S   status   holds   an   asset (Oldacre)   with   a   built-in   gain   which   it   subsequently   exchanges   for  property   of   like   kind   (Newacre)   in   a   Section   1031   nonrecognition transaction.   The   gain   inherent   in   Oldacre   is   preserved   in   Newacre’s  exchanged   basis   under   Section   1031(d).   If the   corporation   disposes   of  Newacre   within   five   years   after   switching   to S status,   the   Section   1374  tax   should   apply   to the   built-in   “C   gain”   even   though   Newacre   was   not  held   on   the   first   day   that   the   corporation   was   subject   to   Subchapter   S.  Section   1374(d)(6)   ensures   this   result   by providing   that   an   asset   taking  an   exchanged   basis   from   another   asset   held   by   the   corporation   at   the  time   it converted   to S status   shall   be   treated   as   having   been   held   as   of  the   beginning   of the   corporation’s   first S year.   In the   above   example,   the  built-in   gain   inherent   in Oldacre   on   the conversion   from   C to S status   is  recognized   under   Section   1374   if the   corporation   disposes   of Newacre   at  a gain   during   the   recognition   period.  Section   1374(d)(8)   is   another   testament   to   Congress’s   protective  attitude   toward   the   double   tax.   It ensures   that   built-in   gain   in   assets  acquired   by   an   S   corporation   from   a   C   corporation   in   a   tax-free  reorganization   does   not   escape   a   corporate   level   tax.   For   this   purpose, the   recognition   period   commences   as   of the   date   the   asset   is acquired  rather   than   on   the   beginning   of the   first   taxable   year   for   which   the corporation   was   an S corporation.?17  25   T.R.C. § 1374(b)(1), (d)(2). Taxable   income, as defined in Section 63(a), 18 modified by  disregarding certain deductions (e.g., the dividends   received   deduction)   and net operating losses. LR.C.   §§  1374(d)(2)(A)Gi);   1375(b)(1)(B). Net   operating loss and capital loss  carryforwards   from prior   years as   a C   corporation are taken into account in computing the  amount subject to tax under   Section   1374.   LR.C. § 1374(b)(2).  216 T.R.C. § 1874(c)(2), (d)(1). 217 J.R.C. § 1374(d)(8).   See   Section G of  this chapter, infra,   for   an overview of  the   tax  consequences   when an   S   corporation is   the   acquiring or target   corporation in   a tax-free reorganization.

714  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3 Tax advisors began to plot strategies to reduce the impact of Section 1374 soon after it was enacted. For example, it was suggested that the  tax might be avoided if an S corporation sold an   asset with built-in gain  during the recognition   period on the installment method but delayed  receipt of any payments (and   thus any   recognized gain) until   after the recognition   period had expired.?!8 Not surprisingly, the Service has expressed its displeasure with this gambit. The regulations   provide that the built-in gain rules will continue to apply to income recognized under the installment method during taxable   years ending after the expiration of the recognition period. The gain, when recognized, will be   subject to  tax under Section 1374.219  Tax   on   Passive   Investment   Income.   When   it widened   the   gates   to  Subchapter   S,   Congress   became   concerned   that   a   C   corporation   with  earnings   and   profits   might   make   an S election   and   redeploy   substantial amounts   in   liquid   assets   yielding   passive   investment   income   such   as dividends   and   interest.   Left   unchecked,   this   strategy   would   enable   a profitable   C corporation   to move   to the   single-tax   regime   of Subchapter S and pass   through   the investment   income   to its shareholders,   who   might delay,   perhaps   forever,   paying   any   shareholder-level   tax   on   the  Subchapter   C earnings   and   profits.   This   plan   had   particular   allure   when  a   C   corporation   sold   all   of   its   operating   assets   and   was   seeking   an alternative   to   the   shareholder-level   tax   that   would   be   imposed   under Section   331   on   a distribution   of the   proceeds   in complete   liquidation.220 The   Code includes two weapons to foil the Subchapter S/passive income ploy. As discussed earlier, an S   corporation   with accumulated  earnings   and profits from its prior life as a C corporation will lose its § status if it has   passive investment   income that exceeds 25 percent of its  gross   receipts for three consecutive   taxable years.22!   In   addition, even before its S status is terminated, the corporation will be   subject to   a corporate-level tax under Section 1375. The tax, which equals 21 percent  of the corporation’s   “excess   net passive   income,” is imposed if an S corporation   has earnings   and profits from a taxable   year prior to its S election and   more   than 25 percent of the corporation’s gross   receipts for the taxable   year consist   of “passive investment income.”222 For purposes of the   Section   1375 tax, “passive investment   income” is  defined as gross   receipts from royalties,   rents, dividends, interest, and annuities.??3 Gains on   the   disposition of property,   interest earned on  obligations acquired   from the   sale   of inventory,   the   gross   receipts of  certain lending   and   finance   institutions, and   dividends   received   from aG  18 See, e.g., Taggart, “Emerging   Tax Issues in Corporate Acquisiti ‘“  Per ass p quisitions,” 44 Tax L. Rev.  219 Reg. § 1.1874—4(h)(1).   For   the  relationship of this  rule to oth 1  eh Ae ane er aspects of Section   1374,  #20 See Chapter 8B1,   supra.  SY LR.C.  § 1362(d)(3).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  corporation   subsidiary that are derived from the active conduct of a trade or business, are not passive investment income.224 To   prevent easy  manipulation of the gross   receipts test, only the   excess of gains over  losses from dispositions of capital   assets   (other than stock and securities) is included in overall   gross receipts, and gross receipts from the sales or  exchanges of stock or securities are taken into account only to the extent  of gains.?25 The term “stock or securities” is interpreted expansively   and includes stock rights, warrants,   debentures,   partnership interests, and  “certificates of interest” in profit-sharing arrangements.226  The   computation   of the   Section   1375   tax is a technician’s   dream   (and  a   student’s   nightmare?).   The   base   for the   Section   1375   tax,   “excess   net passive   income,”   is a percentage   of the corporation’s   “net passive   income,’  which   is generally   equal   to   passive   investment income   less   deductions  directly   connected   with   the   production   of such   income.227   To   arrive   at excess   net   passive   income,   net   passive   income   is multiplied   by a   ratio, which   has   a numerator   equal   to the   excess   of passive   investment   income over   25 percent   of gross   receipts   for the year,   and   a denominator   equal   to passive   investment   income   for   the   year.228   There   is   one   final   caveat: excess   net passive   income   cannot   exceed   the corporation’s   taxable   income for   the   year   computed   with   the   special   changes   described   in   Section  1374(d)(4).229  An   example   may   help   control   the   pollution.   Assume   that   X  Corporation   made   a   Subchapter   S   election   last   year   and   will   have  accumulated   earnings   and   profits   from   prior   C corporation   operations   at  the   end   of its current   taxable   year,   in which   X has   $50,000   of income   from  its   regular   business   operations   and   $35,000   of business   deductions.   X  also   receives   $15,000   of interest   income   and   $10,000   of dividends   and  incurs   $5,000   of   expenses   directly   related   to   the   production   of   the investment   income.  Is X subject to the Section   1375 tax? The corporation will have  Subchapter   C earnings   and profits at the close   of its taxable   year and  more   than 25 percent of its gross   receipts are passive investment   income ($25,000 out of $75,000 of   gross receipts), so the   tax is potentially  applicable. X’s   net passive income is $20,000   ($25,000 of passive  investment   income less directly connected expenses), and it will have  $5,000 of   excess   net passive income ($20,000 of   net passive income multiplied by a ratio having   $6,250 as the numerator ($25,000 of passive  investment   income   reduced   by 25 percent of  gross   receipts) and   $25,000  as   the denominator (passive investment income)).   Since   excess   net  passive   income does   not exceed X’s taxable income as determined   under  224 T.R.C. § 1362(d)(3)(C)(ii)—(Gv). 225 T.R.C. §§  1375(b)(3);   1362(d)(3)(B);   1222(9).  226 See   Reg. § 1.1362—2(c)(4)(i)(B)(3).  227   T.R.C.   § 1875(b)(2). 228 T.R.C. § 1875(b)(1)(A). 229   T.R.C.   § 1875(b)(1)(B).  715

716  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  Section 1374(d)(4),   the corporation’s tax liability will be $1,050 ($5,000 x  21   percent).  Section   1375(d)   offers   one   avenue   for   relief   from   the   Section   1375  tax.   The   tax   may   be   waived   if the   S   corporation   establishes   to   the satisfaction   of the   Service   that   it determined,   in good   faith,   that   it had  no   earnings   and   profits   at   the   close   of   a   taxable   year   and,   within   a  reasonable   period   after   discovering   earnings   and   profits,   they   were distributed.   The   addition   of an   “anti-blunder”   provision   to this   complex  area   is   a   welcome   sign   and   one   hopes   the   Service   is   merciful   in   its  administration   of Section   1375(d).  Congress   also   considered   the   interaction   of Sections   1374   and   1375 with   the   provisions   taxing   the   shareholders   of an   S   corporation.   Any Section   1374   tax is treated   as a loss (characterized   according   to the built- in   gain   subject   to   tax)   sustained   by   the   S corporation   which   will   pass  through   to the shareholders,   and   each   item   of passive   investment   income  is reduced   by its proportionate   share   of the   Section   1375   tax.230 It is important   to keep   the   application   of Sections   1374   and   1375   in  perspective.   A new   corporation   making   a Subchapter S election   generally  does   not   have   to be   concerned   with   either   provision.   Section   1374(c)(1)  will   protect   the   corporation   from   the   Section   1374   tax   and,   since   the  corporation’s   activities   will not   generate   earnings   and   profits,231   Section  1375   cannot   apply   to the corporation.   Therefore,   Sections   1374   and   1375  normally   will not   play a role in deciding   whether   to utilize   a partnership  or   an   S corporation   for a new   venture.  Additional   considerations come into play if   a C corporation is considering a move to   a single   tax regime. An operating C corporation  must consider the impact of Sections 1374 and 1375 on a possible Subchapter S election. Weighed against   these penalty   provisions is the  fact that a shift from C corporation to partnership status requires a  liquidation of the corporation, which may result in significant current corporate and   shareholder tax liability.282 The immediate tax cost of  converting to   a partnership or limited   lability company   may be  significant enough to tip the balance in favor of a Subchapter S election  and force an accommodation with   Sections   1374   and 1375, if planning cannot   successfully   eliminate their impact.  PROBLEMS   "  1. Built-in Corporation (“B”) was   formed in 2011 as   a C corporation. The shareholders of B elected S  corporation   status   effective as of J  anuary 1, 2016, when it had no Subchapter   C  earnings   and profits and the   following assets:  230 LR.C. § 1366(£)(2), (8). ae   1LR.C.-§   1871 (64). 282 See   I.R.C.   §§  331,   336,   1001.

(b)   Same   as   (a), above,   except   that   B’s taxable   income   for 2019   if  it were   not   an   S corporation   would   be   $20,000.  (c)   Same   as   (a), above,   except   that   B   also   sells   the   machinery   for  $40,000   in   2020,   when   it   would   have   substantial   taxable  income   if it were   not   an   S corporation. (d)   B trades   the   building   for an   apartment   building   in a tax-free  § 1031   exchange   and   then   sells   the   apartment   building   for  $50,000   in   2019,   when   it   would   have   substantial   taxable  income   if it were   not   an   S corporation.

The   San   Diego Bay Boat   Storage   and   Marina   Corporation (“Bay”) was  formed in 2014 as a C  corporation   and  has substantial accumulated   earnings  and profits. Bay’s   business consists   of  three primary activities. About one-  third  of  Bay’s  gross   receipts   are derived   from   marine service and repair work conducted   by its two   mechanics.   Another   one-third   of  Bay’s total   receipts  come   from   the rental   of  berths to boat   owners.   Berthing fees  vary   depending  upon   the   size of the particular   boat. A  boat   owner   renting a berth   from   Bay  must   pay   a  separate   charge   to  have   Bay’s   employees   launch or  haul   out   his

718  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  boat.   However,   if given   advance   notice,   Bay   employees   will   fuel   an   owner’s  boat,   charging   only for the   fuel.   The   remainder   of Bay’s   receipts   come   from  dry   storage   of boats.   Owners   pay   $500   per   month   for   dry   storage   in   Bay’s warehouse   where   a Bay employee   is on   duty 24 hours   a day. For this fee, Bay  employees   will   launch,   fuel   (with   a   charge   for   fuel)   and   haul   out   the   boat  whenever   requested   by the   owner.   Bay’s   mechanics   also   will perform a free  engine   analysis   every   other   year   for owners   of power   boats   in dry storage. Bay is considering   the possibility   of making   a Subchapter   S election   and  has requested   your   advice   concerning   any   problems   which   it may have.   What  difference   would   it make   if Bay   were   a newly   formed   corporation?  G.   COORDINATION   WITH   OTHER   INCOME   TAX  PROVISIONS 1.   SUBCHAPTER   C233  Code:   §§ 1871;   1372. It   is   important   to   remember   that   an   S   corporation   is   still   a  corporation   for   many   tax   purposes.   It is organized   in the   same   manner  as other   corporations,   and   it may   engage   in most   of the transactions   and experience   the   corporate   adjustments   encountered   throughout   this   text.  After   incorporating   or   escaping   from   Subchapter   C, S corporations   may make   nonliquidating   distributions   of   property   or   stock,   engage   in redemptions,   or   acquire   other   businesses   in   either   taxable   or   tax-free  transactions.   They   may   sell   their   assets   and   liquidate,   be   acquired   by  another   corporation,   or divide   up   into   two   or more   separate   corporations.  The   tax   consequences   of these   and   other   events   in an   § corporation’s   life cycle   are   determined   by   a   patchwork   quilt   of   Code   sections   pieced together   from   Subchapters   C   and   S.   The   resulting   product   provides   a  challenging   opportunity   to   study   the   uneasy   relationship   between   a double   tax   regime   and   a pass-through   scheme.  Section   1371(a)   begins the statutory snake   dance   with the deceptively   simple   general rule that the provisions of Subchapter   C apply to an S corporation   and its shareholders.   This broad admonition is  subject to two   related   exceptions. First, any   provision in the Code specifically applicable to S  corporations   naturally will apply. Second, if the provisions of Subchapter   C are “inconsistent   with” Subchapter S,  the S rules are controlling.   Reliable   authority is sparse on precisely how Congress   intended to harmonize the   rules, but   the   Service   gradually   has  offered guidance.   The details   are best   raised in   the   context of specific transactions.  Formation of a Corporation. All  the basic   rules   studied in connection  with   the   formation of a C   corporation   apply to newly   formed   § 233 See   generally McMahon   &   Simmons,   “When Subchapter   S  Meet :  ie eee pter   eets Subchapter C,” 67

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  corporations.?84 Shareholders who comprise the founding 80 percent or  more “control” group do not recognize gain or loss on the transfer of  property to the corporation if the requirements of Section 351(a) are met,  but realized gain is recognized to the extent the shareholder receives  boot? or if the transferred liabilities exceed the shareholder’s basis for  the transferred property.236 Shareholders   determine their basis in stock,  debt   obligations and other   boot received under Section 358. The  corporation takes a transferred basis in any   contributed assets under  Section 362(a). Organizational   expenditures may be deducted and  amortized if the corporation elects to do so under Section 248, and the  benefit of the deductions passes through to the shareholders.  Several   other   formation   issues,   most   relating   to the “small   business  corporation   requirements,”   are   unique   to   S corporations.   To   qualify   for  the   S election,   the   corporation   must   be   mindful   of the   100-shareholder  limit   and   the   prohibition   against   certain   types   of   shareholders   (e.g., nonresident   aliens,   partnerships).   As   for   capital   structure,   an   S corporation   is   limited   to   one   class   of   stock   and   thus   may   not   issue preferred   stock,   but   it is free   to   issue   debt,   preferably   in   a   form   that  qualifies   for the   straight   debt   safe   harbor.?37   Unlike   a corporation   facing  the   double   tax,   an   S corporation   has   no   particular   incentive   to issue   pro  rata   debt   to its shareholders.?38  S Corporations   as   Shareholders.   At one   time,   an   S corporation   in its capacity   as   a   shareholder   of   another   corporation   was   treated   as   an  individual   for purposes   of Subchapter   C. The   purpose   of this   rule   was   to ensure   that   an   S   corporation   would   not   qualify   for   the   Section   243  dividends   received   deduction,   which   is   designed   to   prevent   double  taxation   at the corporate   level and   thus   should   not be available   to a pass- through   entity.239   As   drafted,   however,   the   rule   had a   ripple   effect   on other   transactions,   leading   Congress   to   repeal   it   and   clarify   the   tax consequences   of   many   of   the   transactions   discussed   below.   The  legislative   history   includes   a   reminder   that   S   corporations,   like individuals,   may   not   claim   a   dividends   received   deduction   or   treat   any  item   of income   or deduction   in a manner   inconsistent   with   the treatment accorded   to individual   taxpayers.?4°  Distributions and   Liquidating Sales. As   discussed earlier,?4!  Subchapter   S  generally preempts   Subchapter   C in determining the   tax  consequences of nonliquidating distributions.   Section   1368 specifically  234 See   generally Chapter 2, supra.  235 LR.C. § 351(b). 236 T.R.C. § 357(¢). 237 T.R.C. § 1361(c)(5).  238 For   the advantages   and   disadvantages of issuing   debt in  the S  corporation setting,   see  Eustice, Kuntz   &  Bogdanski,   Federal   Income   Taxation of S Corporations   § 6.03[1].  239 See, e.g., S.Rep.   No.   640,   97th   Cong.,   9d   Sess.   15, reprinted in 1982-2 C.B.   718, 724— 725.   240 See   H.R.   Rep.   No.   104-737,   104th   Cong.,   2d  Sess.   56  (1996). 241 See   Section   E  of this  chapter,   supra.  719

--- Page 790 ---

720  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  provides that it shall apply to any distribution to which Section 301(c)  otherwise would apply. This means that Section 1368 is the reference point not only for routine nonliquidating distributions   but also other transactions, such as dividend-equivalent redemptions and taxable stock distributions, which are classified under Subchapter   C as distributions  to which Section   301 applies.242 We have seen   that an S corporation recognizes   gain under Section 311(b) on a distribution of appreciated  property but, unless   Section 1374 applies, that gain is not taxed at the  corporate level. Instead, the gain   passes through to the shareholders, who may increase their stock basis by their respective shares of the gain.  In   the   case   of   liquidating   distributions   and   sales,   Subchapter   C  reassumes   center   stage.   Liquidating   distributions   generally   trigger recognition   of gain   or   loss   to an   S corporation   under   Section   336   in the same   manner   as if the corporation   were   subject   to Subchapter   C. Sales   of  assets   pursuant   to   a   plan   of complete   liquidation   also   are   taxable.   In  either   case,   however,   these   gains   will   pass   through   to the   shareholders and   be   subject   to   a   single   shareholder-level   tax   unless   Section   1374 intercedes.   An   S   corporation   also   may   make   a   liquidating   sale   on   the  installment   method.   Under   certain   conditions,   these   installment  obligations   may   be   distributed   without   triggering   corporate-level   gain  (unless   Section   1374   applies),   and   the   shareholders   may   use   the  installment   method   to   report   the   gain.248   The   character   of   the  shareholder’s   gain   in   this   situation   is   not   determined   by   reference   to  their   stock,   which   ordinarily   would   be   a   capital   asset,   but   rather   “in  accordance   with   the   principles   of   Section   1366(d)”244—i.e.,   as   if the corporate-level   gain   on   the   sale   of the   asset   had   been   passed   through   to  the   shareholders.245 Subchapter   C also governs the shareholder-level consequences of a  complete liquidation. An S corporation shareholder treats distributions in complete liquidation as in full payment in exchange for the  stock under Section 331. Although liquidating   distributions and sales   result   in only  one level   of  tax to an S  corporation   and its shareholders,?46   variations  between the shareholder’s stock   basis and the corporation’s   basis in its assets may have an impact on   the character of the shareholder’s   gain or  loss. For example, assume A owns all of the   stock of   S, Inc. (an S  corporation   with no  prior C history) and   has a $2,000 basis in her S stock.  242 See, e.g., I.R.C. §§ 302(d):   305(b). Section   306 is unlikely to apply in the S setting,  however,   because an S corporation may not   issue preferred stock.  ae See RAGS 453B(h).   To qualify for corporate-level   nonrecognition, the S  corporation  must distribute   the   obligation in complete liquidation.   In  addition,   the   obligations must result  from   sales of assets   (other than nonbulk sales   of inventory)   during the 12-month period following   the adoption of  the  liquidation   plan. See L.R.C. § 453(h).  244 T.R.C. § 4538B(h).  __ >45 Thus, if the installment sale would   have   given rise   to ordinary   income,   that   character will pass through to the shareholders   when they collect the  installment   obligations.  246 This is because the   corporate-level   gain   on a liquidating   distribution or   sale   results   in  upward basis adjustments to the  shareholder’s   stock   under   Section   1367. A  double   tax would   be  imposed,   however, if Section   1374   applies.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS   721  Assume S   owns one ordinary income asset which has a $10,000 fair  market value and a $1,000   adjusted basis. If S sells the asset, it will  recognize   $9,000 of ordinary income. The gain   passes through to A, and her stock   basis is increased by $9,000, to $11,000, under Section 1367.  When S liquidates and distributes $10,000 cash to A, she recognizes a $1,000 long-term capital loss. Alternatively, if the ordinary income asset had a $2,000 basis, S  would recognize   $8,000 of ordinary income on its  sale which   would pass through to A, increasing her stock  basis to $10,000.  When S liquidates and distributes $10,000 cash to A, she would recognize  no additional   gain or  loss.  Taxable   Acquisitions   of   S   Corporations.   An   acquisition   of   an   S  corporation   may   be   structured   as   either   a   purchase   of stock   from   the  shareholders   or   a purchase   of assets   from   the   corporation.   The   method  chosen   affects   not   only the amount,   character   and   timing   of gain but   also  may   have   an   impact   on   the   tax   status   of the   S corporation   and   perhaps  even   the   acquiring   party   if it also   is an   S corporation.  An   asset   acquisition   often   is preferable   because   the   purchaser   will  obtain   a   cost   basis   in   the   S   corporation’s   assets   at   the   cost   of only   a  shareholder-level   tax.247   For   example,   assume   P, Inc.   wishes   to   acquire  T,   Inc.   (an   S   corporation   with   no   prior   C   history).   If P   purchases   T’s assets,   any   gain   or   loss   recognized   by T on   the   sale   will pass   through   to  its   shareholders,   and   P   will   obtain   a   cost   basis   in   the   assets.   T’s  shareholders   will increase   their   stock basis   by any   gain recognized   on the  sale under   Section   1367, thus   avoiding   a second   tax on the same   economic gain when   T liquidates.  If   P is a C corporation   and   purchases a controlling   interest   in the   T  stock,   the   T shareholders   recognize   gain   or loss   on   the   sale,   and   P takes  a cost basis   in the stock it acquires.   T’s S election   will terminate,   however,  because   an   S   corporation   is not   permitted   to   have   any   C   corporation  shareholders.248   If   P does   not   make   a Section   338   election,   T retains   its historic   bases   in its   assets,   and   as   a new   C   corporation   it will   face   the  prospect   of a corporate-level   tax on any built-in   gain. If   P makes   a Section 338 election   to obtain   a cost basis in T’s assets,   T—which   loses its S status on   the   acquisition—must   pay   an   immediate   corporate-level   tax   as   a result   of the   deemed   asset   sale,   which   is rarely   a good   outcome.?49   If P  and   T jointly   make   a Section   338(h)(10)   election,   the   regulations   provide  that   old T (still considered   an S corporation   at this point) recognizes   gain  247 Once again, this assumes that  the corporation   has no built-in gains  that would be taxed  under Section   1374.   In  contrast, a taxable   acquisition of  assets from a C corporation   generates  tax at both   the  corporate   and   shareholder levels if the target  liquidates.   See Chapter 8B,  supra.  248 T.R.C. §§ 1362(d)(2);   1361(b)(1)(B).   After   1996,   two or more   S  corporations may have a  parent-subsidiary   relationship in which case they are treated as one S   corporation for tax  purposes. I.R.C. § 1361(b)(8).  249 ‘'T’s S election terminates   when   P  acquires T’s   stock, and its short C year   includes   the  day of  the   terminating event.   Thus,   the   gain   on   the deemed asset   sale must be  reported on a one-day   return for   old   T’s   “short C year.”   See   I.R.C.   §§  1362(e)(1)(B);   338(a)(1).   The   economic  burden of  the   corporate-level   tax is borne   by P  unless it  is reflected in the   price   paid for  the  stock.

722  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  or loss on the deemed sale of its assets and then is deemed to have distributed   those assets in complete liquidation.25° The gain or loss on the deemed asset sale passes through to T’s shareholders,   with resulting  basis adjustments to their T stock. Those adjustments then may be taken into account in determining the shareholders’   gain or loss under Section 331 on the deemed complete liquidation of old T.251  The   regulations   under   Section   336(e)   offer   treatment   essentially  equivalent   to   a   Section   338(h)(10)   election   when   S   corporation shareholders   make   a qualified   stock   disposition,   which   basically   is a sale, exchange   or   distribution   within   a   12-month   period   of an   80   percent   or more   controlling   interest.   A   Section   336(e)   election   is   available   for  dispositions   of stock   that   do not   qualify   under   Section   338(h)(10),   such   as  sales   to noncorporate   buyers   or   a combination   of sales   and   distributions. If a Section   336(e)   election   is made   in connection   with   a stock   sale,   the   S  corporation   target   is deemed   to sell its assets   to   a new   corporation   while  still   an   S corporation;   the   shareholders   take   their   pro   rata   share   of the  gains   and   losses   into   account   and   adjust   their   stock   basis;   and   the   old target   S corporation   is deemed   to make a distribution   to its shareholders  and   go out   of business.252  The benefit of either a Section   338(h)(10) or Section 336(e)   election is that a stock sale will be taxed as if it were a sale   of the S corporation’s assets. Whether that tax treatment is beneficial to the parties requires  careful analysis of several   variables, including the tax character of those  assets. For example, a deemed asset sale may not be   desirable if it gives  rise   to a significant amount of ordinary income such as when the  corporation’s assets are weighted   towards inventory,   receivables, and property triggering recapture of depreciation or amortization. By  comparison, the “look-through” rules   on a sale   of S  corporation stock   do  not extend to ordinary income property253 and thus the   entire gain ona stock sale may qualify for the lower capital gains rates. Taxable   Acquisitions   by S Corporations. When the purchasing corporation (“P”) is an S corporation,   the primary concern   usually is the preservation of  P’s S status. If P   purchases the   assets of T, the mix of  consideration   used in the transaction must be tailored to the S corporation eligibility requirements.   P thus   should   avoid using its own  stock or hybrid debt in order to avoid running afoul   of the   100- shareholder limit or the prohibition   against having   more   than one   class  of stock.254  When an S corporation   acquires   the   stock   of  T, the   acquisition will  not necessarily result   in a loss   of  the acquiring   corporation’s   S status because   S  corporations may have   controlled C  corporation   subsidiaries.  0 See   Reg. § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(3)(i): —1(d)(4)(a). 251 See   Reg. § 1.338(h)(10)—1(d)(5)(@). 52 Reg.   §§  1.336—2(b)(1)@)—(iii),   —2(h)(8) Example 2. 253 See   Section   D4 of this  chapter,   supra.  254 See   generally   L.R.C. § 1361(b).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS   723  In addition, an acquiring S corporation is eligible to make a Section   338  election, which will trigger immediate recognition of all T’s gains and  losses. Finally, if an S corporation acquires 80 percent or more of T’s stock  and liquidates T, the liquidation will be tax free to both corporations  under Sections   332 and 337. Following that hquidation, however, any of  T’s built-in gains   while it was a C corporation may later be subject to tax under Section 1374 upon a subsequent disposition.255 Tax-Free   Reorganizations.   An   S corporation   may   be either   the target or   the   acquiring   corporation   in   a   tax-free   acquisitive   reorganization. Looking   first   to   situations   where   an S   corporation   is the   target,   it will lose   its   S   status   if it remains   in   existence   as   an   80   percent   or   more subsidiary   following   a tax-free   acquisition   of its stock   by a C corporation in   a   Type   B   reorganization   or   reverse   triangular   merger.   If   an   S  corporation-target’s   assets   are   acquired   in   a   merger   or   Type   C  reorganization,   the   transaction   may   proceed   on   a tax-free   basis,   and   the  target   will   terminate   its   existence   as   a   result   of   the   merger   or   the  liquidation   that   must   follow   a Type   C reorganization. If   an   S   corporation   is   the   acquiring   corporation   in   a   tax-free reorganization,   it   will   issue   new   stock   to   the   target   shareholders.  Whatever   form   of acquisition   is used,   care   must   be   exercised   to   avoid termination   of the   election   by   exceeding   the   100-shareholder   limit   or  inheriting   an   ineligible   shareholder.   Now   that   S corporations   may   have subsidiaries,   a   Type   B   stock-for-stock   acquisition,   once   impossible  without   losing   S   status,   is   now   a   feasible   alternative.   Similarly,  acquisition   of   the   assets   of   a   C   corporation   in   a   Type   A   or   C  reorganization   should   not   adversely   affect   the   acquirer’s   S election,   but the   earnings   and   profits   from   the   target’s   C years   could   jeopardize   the acquiring   corporation’s   S status   or   subject   it to the   Section   1375   tax   if it has   substantial   passive   investment   income.256   Moreover,   an   S  corporation   that   is   the   acquiring   corporation   in   a   Type   A   or   C  reorganization   or   a   forward   triangular   merger   will   inherit   the   target’s  tax   attributes,   including   its earnings   and   profits,   under   Section   381,   and  its   accumulated   adjustments   account   if the   target   is an   S corporation with   a   prior   C   history.257   Finally,   any   assets   acquired   from   a   C  corporation   in   a   tax-free   reorganization   trigger   a   new   five-year  recognition   period   for   purposes   of   the   Section   1374   tax   on   built-in gains.?58  Corporate Divisions. An S corporation may divide itself into separate  corporations in a transaction that is tax-free at both   the   corporate   and  shareholder levels if  all the requirements of Section   355 are   met. Even  when S corporations   were not permitted to have subsidiaries,   the  Service was   tolerant   in  this   area, ignoring   the   transitory   nature of a subsidiary 255 As to  built-in   gains,   see   I.R.C. § 1374(d)(8);   Reg. § 1.1374-8.  256 T.R.C.   §§  1362(b)(3);   1375. 257 For   rules   on AAA carryovers,   see   Reg.   §  1.1368-2(d)(2).  258   T.R.C.   § 1874(d)(8).

NET   INVESTMENT   INCOME   TAX  Section   1411,   which   applies   to   individuals,   estates   and   trusts,  imposes   a 3.8 percent   tax   on   the   lesser   of the   taxpayer’s   “net   investment income”   or   adjusted   gross   income   (with   some   specialized   modifications) in excess   of certain   high-income   thresholds   ($250,000   for   married   filing jointly   taxpayers   and   $200,000   for   single   and   unmarried   head   of household   filers).261   “Net   investment   income”   is   generally   interest,  dividends,   annuities,   royalties,   and   income   from   Section   469   passive  activities   (i.e., trade   or business   activities   in which   the taxpayer   does   not materially   participate).262   S   corporations   pass   through   net   investment income   items   and   related   expenses   to their   shareholders.   Shareholders who   are   active   in   the   business   (i.e.,   who   “materially   participate”   in   a trade   or   business   activity)   are   not   subject   to the   net   investment   income  tax   on   their   pro   rata   share   of the   S corporation’s   business   income.   As   we  will   see   shortly,   that   same   income   also   may   escape   federal   employment  taxes,   263  Dispositions of S corporation stock raise additional issues under the  net investment   income tax.   If the selling shareholder does not materially  participate in any activities   of the business, the transaction is classified as  a disposition of an   interest in a passive activity and the capital gain or loss is included in net investment income.264 If the seller materially participates in one or more of the corporation’s business activities,  proposed regulations   require a complex   look-through   approach   under which each   separate trade or business activity is deemed to have   been sold for its fair market value. The shareholder’s pro   rata shares of gains  and losses from the hypothetical sales   of material   participation activities are excluded in determining the shareholder’s net investment income.265  3. STATE   AND   LOCAL   TAXES  The tax laws of most states with an income tax recognize a federal S corporation election and treat S  corporations as pass-through entities.  269 See, e.g., G.C.M.   39678 (1987).  oe For   other issues, such as how to divide up the accumulated   adjustments account, see  Eustice, Kuntz   & Bogdanski,   supra note   238, at 4 12.10.  26S   RCs   1411(a)(1).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  But there are exceptions and other   potential complications   caused by a  lack of uniformity at the state level. For example,   S corporations  organized in California must pay the greater of the $800 minimum franchise tax or 1.5 percent of net income. Other states impose   modest business privilege or minimum taxes on S corporations even if they have no   net income. Some states (e.g., New York and New Jersey) may require a separate S election to be filed. A few   taxing jurisdictions (e.g., New  Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, the District of Columbia, and New York  City) treat an S corporation as   a separate taxable entity. S corporations with multi-state connections also may confront other issues, such as the  need to apportion their income among the states in which they   conduct  business activities and   withhold   income taxes on income allocable to nonresident shareholders.  PROBLEMS 1.   Hi-Flying   Co.   is an   aggressive   growth   company   which   was   formed   as   a C   corporation   many   years   ago   to   develop   new   innovative   technology.   Hi- Flying   has   been   successful   and   expects   to   receive   inquiries   concerning possible   taxable   and   tax-free   takeovers   in   the   next   few   years.   Can   Hi-  Flying’s   shareholders   improve   their   tax   situation   in   a   future   takeover   by  making   an S   election?   In   general,   if Hi-Flying   makes   an S   election,   would  you   advise   a   potential   corporate   purchaser   desiring   a   cost   basis   in   Hi- Flying’s   assets   to structure   its acquisition   as   a purchase   of stock   or   assets? 2.   Target   Corporation   (“T”)   is   a   C   corporation   which   has   substantially  appreciated   assets   and   is   a   takeover   candidate   being   pursued   by   several  suitors.   Purchasing   Corporation   (“P”)   has   a   Subchapter   S election   in effect  and   is considering   making a bid for T. Consider   the   tax   consequences   of the following   acquisition   offers   by P:  (a)   P will   offer   to purchase   T’s   stock   for cash   or   a combination   of  cash   and P notes. (b)   P will acquire   T in a Type C reorganization.  H.   COMPENSATION   ISSUES  S  corporation   shareholders commonly serve as  officers, directors and  employees of their corporation.   Individuals   with this multiple status   can choose whether to withdraw cash as compensation for their   services or  as a shareholder distribution. Salary payments are deductible by the  corporation as   a business   expense (with   the   benefit   of  the deduction  passing   through to the   shareholders),   and are includible in   the  employee’s gross   income.   These   “wages” also   are subject to federal employment taxes imposed on both   the employer   and the employee.).76  Under the   social   security component of   the   Federal   Insurance Contributions   Act   (known as FICA),   the  tax is 12.4   percent of wages   paid  up to  an   indexed   cap   ($132,900 for 2019)   and is  split equally   between the  266 Wages   also   may   be subject   to  state   and   local employment taxes.  725

726  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  employer and the employee. The additional Medicare tax is 2.9 percent of all wages (so there is no   cap),   also split equally between   employer and  employee.267 For wages over certain high-income thresholds ($250,000  for married taxpayers who file a joint return, $200,000 for unmarried and  head of household filers), the Medicare tax   rate   on the employee’s share  of the  excess is increased to 3.8 percent.268 Under a parallel system, self-  employed taxpayers are subject to a 12.4 percent tax on   their self- employment income up to the indexed cap and a 2.9 percent Medicare tax  on all their self-employment   income (3.8 percent for earnings over   the  high-income thresholds).?®9 S corporation   shareholders   generally   are   not   subject   to employment  taxes   on   amounts   that   are   not   received   as   “wages,”   such   as   distributions,  and   a shareholder’s   pro   rata   share   of the   corporation’s   business   income  is not   taxed   as   self-employment   income.   By   contrast,   general   partners and   members   of LLCs   who   are   active   in their   firm’s   business   are   subject  to   self-employment   tax   on   their   distributive   share   of trade   or   business  income.   “Guaranteed”   payments   for services   rendered   to or   on   behalf   of a   partnership   or   LLC   also   are   generally   treated   as   income   from   self-  employment.27°  Because the payment of salaries to shareholders usually results in a tax “wash” in the case   of a profitable corporation (the compensation  deduction   reduces the operating income that passes through to the  shareholders), the income tax consequences of salaries and distributions may be identical.271 It is the escalating employment tax base and the  disparate treatment of S corporations and   partnerships that have  influenced some service providers to form   S corporations to avoid the uncapped   Medicare tax by foregoing much or even all of  their   salaries  and instead withdrawing cash through   shareholder distributions.  To illustrate, assume that Consultant is a single taxpayer who has $500,000 of   net earnings   from her consulting practice and no other earned   income. If she conducts her business as a sole proprietor,   her self-  employment tax will be 12.4 percent of self-employment   income up to the applicable cap,   2.9 percent on the first $200,000 of self-employment income   and 3.8 percent on the $300,000 of self-employment   income that exceeds the $200,000   high-income threshold for single taxpayers. Assume, alternatively,   that Consultant   incorporates   her   practice and  elects S  corporation status and the corporation nets   the same $500,000,  all attributable to Consultant’s services, pays Consultant a salary of  $200,000,   and either   retains   the $300,000   balance or distributes it to  267‘ 1.R.C. §§ 3101;   3111;   3121. The   employee portion is collected through   withholding   from wages. I.R.C. § 3102.  268 T.R.C. §§  3101(b)(2); 3121(b). 269 T.R.C. § 1401.

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  Consultant as a dividend. If this arrangement is respected, Consultant  saves the $11,400 of Medicare tax (3.8 percent of $300,000) that would  have   been owed on the last $300,000 of her earnings not paid out as  wages. This   strategy   became   known   as the “John   Edwards   loophole”   after it was   revealed   during   the   2004   Presidential   election   campaign   that   Vice  Presidential   candidate   and   former   Senator   John   Edwards   had   conducted  his lucrative   law   practice   as   an   S corporation,   paying   himself   a relatively modest   salary and withdrawing   many   millions   more   as distributions.   The maneuver   also   was   utilized   by   former   House   Speaker   Newt   Gingrich, who   conducted   his   consulting   and   public   speaking   businesses   through   S  corporations   that   in   2010   paid   him   $444,000   in   wages   out   of roughly  $2.84   million   of total   net   earnings,   saving   $69,000   in Medicare   taxes.272  Anecdotal   evidence   suggests   that   these   are   not   isolated   examples   and  may   explain   why   over   60   percent   of   S   corporations   have   only   one  shareholder.?73  The   Radtke   case,   below,   is   one   court’s   hostile   reaction   to   this  maneuver   in an   extreme   fact   pattern.  Joseph   Radtke,   S.C.   v.   United   States  United   States   District   Court,   Eastern   District   of Wisconsin,   1989.  712   F.Supp.   143,   affirmed   895   F.2d   1196   (7th   Cir.1990).  ORDER  a TERENCE   T. EVANS,   DISTRICT   JUDGE.  CU   oS  FACTS None   of the facts   are   disputed. Joseph   Radtke received his law   degree   from Marquette University  in 1978. The   Radtke corporation   was   incorporated in 1979 to provide  legal   services in Milwaukee. Mr. Radtke is the firm’s   sole incorporator,  director, and shareholder. In  1982, he also served as the unpaid president  and treasurer of  the  corporation,   while his wife Joyce  was the unpaid   and nominal vice-president   and secretary. The   corporation is an   electing small   business   corporation,   otherwise known as   a subchapter   S corporation.   This means that it  is not taxed at the corporate level. All  corporate   income is taxed to the shareholder, whether or not   the income is distributed.  In   1982,   Mr.   Radtke   was the   only   full-time employee of   the corporation,   though it employed a few   other   persons on a piece-meal   and  part-time basis. Under an employment contract   executed   between   Mr.  272 This   information   was   revealed when   Senator   Edwards   and   Speaker   Gingrich   made their   tax  returns   available to the public   during their   unsuccessful   Presidential   campaigns.  273 The   most   recent   available   data is  for   2012.   See   IRS   Statistics   of  Income,   Returns   of  Active   Corporations,   Form   1120S   for  Tax   Year   2012,   Table 6.  727

728  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  Radtke and his corporation in 1980, he  received “an annual base salary,  to be determined   by its board of directors, but in   no event shall such  annual salary be less than   $0 per year * * * . Employee’s original annual  base salary shall be $0.” This base salary of $0 continued through 1982,  a year in which Mr. Radtke devoted all of   his working time to representing the corporation’s clients.  Mr.   Radtke   received   $18,225   in   dividends   from   the   corporation   in  1982.   Whenever   he   needed   money,   and   whenever   the   corporation   was  showing   a profit—that   is, when   there   was   money   in its bank   account— he would   do what   was   necessary   under   Wisconsin   corporate   law   to have  the   board   declare   a   dividend,   and   he   would   write   a   corporate   check   to  himself. Mr.   Radtke   paid   personal   income   tax   on   the   dividends   in   1982.   The Radtke   corporation   also declared   the $18,225   on its form   1120S,   the small business   corporation   income   tax   return.   But   the   corporation   did   not   file  a   federal   employment   tax   form   (Form   941)   or   a   federal   unemployment  tax   form   (Form   940).   In   other   words,   it did   not   deduct   a   portion   of the $18,225   for   Social   Security   (FICA)   and   unemployment   compensation  (FUTA).   The   IRS   subsequently   assessed   deficiencies   as   well   as   interest and   penalties.   The   Radtke   corporation   paid   the   full   amount   that   IRS  demanded   under   FUTA—$366.44—and   it also   paid   $593.75   toward   the assessed   FICA   taxes,   interest,   and   penalties.   Then   the   corporation   sued here   after   a fruitless   claim   for refunds.  DISCUSSION  KR *  The   Radtke corporation acknowledges that wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes, but it argues that   the Internal Revenue Code nowhere treats a shareholder-employee’s dividends as wages for the  purpose of employment taxes. The   government, on the other hand, contends that   “since Joseph   Radtke   performed substantial services for  Joseph   Radtke, S.C., and did   not   receive reasonable compensation for  such services   other than ‘dividends’,   the   ‘dividends’ constitute   ‘wages’  subject to federal employment taxes.” The government does not   allege  that   the Radtke corporation is  a fiction that somehow failed to comply  with Wisconsin statutes governing corporations. The   Federal   Insurance   Contributions   Act   defines “wages” as   “all  remuneration for employment,” with   various   exceptions that are   not relevant to   this dispute.   26   U.S.C. § 3121(a).   Similarly,   the Federal  Unemployment Tax   Act   defines “wages” as   “all remuneration for  employment,” with   certain   exceptions   that are   not   relevant.   26   U.S.C. § 3306(b). (Dividends are   not   specifically excepted in   either act, and  “remuneration” is not   defined.)   Mr.   Radtke   was   clearly   an “employee” of the Radtke   corporation, as the   plaintiff   concedes.   See   26   U.S.C. §§  3121(d)   and   3306(i).   Likewise,   his work for   the   enterprise   was  obviously   “employment.”   See   26 U.S.C.   §§ 3121(b)   and   3306(c).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  According to the Radtke corporation, not all “income” can be characterized as “wages.” I agree. See Royster Company v. United States,  479   F.2d 387, 390 (4th Cir.1978) (free lunches did not constitute “wages”  subject to FICA and FUTA); Central Illinois Public   Service Co. v. United  States, 485 U.S. 21, 25, 98 S.Ct. 9179919, 155. L.ied-2d #82.01978)  (reimbursement for lunches not “wages” subject to withholding tax; Court says in  dicta that dividends are not wages).  At   the   same   time,   however,   I   am   not   moved   by   the   Radtke  corporation’s   connected   argument   that   “dividends”   cannot   be   “wages.”  Courts   reviewing   tax   questions   are   obligated   to look at the substance,   not the form, of the transactions   at issue.   Transactions   between   a closely held corporation   and   its principals,   who   may   have   multiple   relationships   with the   corporation,   are   subject   to   particularly   careful   scrutiny.   Whether  dividends   represent   a distribution   of profits   or instead   are   compensation  for employment   is a matter   to be determined   in view   of all the   evidence. In   the   circumstances   of   this   case—where   the   corporation’s   only director   had   the   corporation   pay   himself,   the   only   significant   employee, no   salary   for   substantial   services—I   believe   that   Mr.   Radtke’s “dividends”   were   in fact “wages”   subject   to FICA   and   FUTA   taxation.   His “dividends”   functioned   as   remuneration   for employment. It   seems   only   logical   that   a   corporation   is   required   to   pay employment   taxes   when   it   employs   an   employee.   See   Automated Typesetting,   Inc.   v.   United   States,   527   F.Supp.   515,   519   (K.D.Wis.1981)  (corporation   liable   for   employment   taxes   on   payments   to   officers   who  performed   more   than   nominal   services   for corporation);   C.D.   Ulrich,   Ltd.  v. United   States,   692   F.Supp.   1053,   1055   (D.Minn.1988)   (discussing   case law   defining   who   is   an   “employee”;   court   refuses   to   enjoin   IRS   from  collecting   employment   taxes   from   S corporation   that   paid   dividends   but  no   salary   to sole   shareholder   and   director,   a certified   public   accountant who   worked   for   the   firm).   See   also   Rev.   Rul.   73-361,   1973-2   C.B.   331  (stockholder-officer   who   performed   substantial   services   for S corporation is “employee,”   and   his salary is subject to FICA   and   FUTA   tax); Rev.   Rul.  71-86,   1971-1   C.B.   285   (president   and   sole   stockholder   of corporation   1s  “employee”   whose   salary   is subject   to employment   taxes,   even   though   he alone   fixes   his salary   and   determines   his duties). An   employer should not   be permitted to evade FICA and FUTA by  characterizing all of   an employee’s   remuneration as something other  than   “wages.” Cf. Greenlee v. United States, 87-1   U.S.T.C.   Para. 9306  corporation’s interest-free   loans to  sole shareholder   constituted   “wages” for FICA and FUTA where loans   were made at shareholder’s   discretion  and   he performed substantial   services for corporation).   This is simply the  flip   side   of  those   instances in which   corporations   attempt to disguise profit   distributions as salaries   for whatever tax   benefits   that may  produce.   See, e.g., Miles-Conley Co. v. Commissioner,   173  F.2d   958, 960—  61   (4th   Cir.1949)   (corporation   could   not   deduct   from its gross   income excessive   salary   paid  to  president   and   sole  stockholder).  729

730  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  Accordingly, the   plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is  DENIED, and the defendant's motion for summary judgment is  GRANTED. The plaintiff is ORDERED to pay the remaining deficiency  on its 1982 FICA taxes along   with the assessed interest, penalties, and  fees.  NOTE  Subsequent   Case   Law   Developments.   In accord   with   Radtke   are   Fred   R.  Esser,   P.C.   v.   United   States,274   Dunn   &   Clark,   P.A.   v.   Commissioner,?75  Spicer Accounting   Inc. v. United   States,27°   Veterinary   Surgical   Consultants,  P.C.   v.   Commissioner,?77   David   E. Watson,   P.C.   v. United   States?78,   and   Nu-  Look   Design,   Inc. v. Commissioner.279   A contrary   result   was   reached   in Davis v. United   States,28°   where   the court   declined   to recharacterize   S corporation  distributions   as   taxable   wages.   Davis   is distinguishable,   however,   because the   shareholders   performed   only   minor   services   on   behalf   of   the   S  corporation. IRS   Enforcement.   The   S corporation   employment   tax avoidance   strategy  has   presented   enforcement   challenges   for the   IRS.   Even   if the   Service   spots the   issue,   it must   engage   in a fact   intensive   analysis   to determine   whether an   S corporation   owner-employee   has   been   paid   “reasonable   compensation.”  Many   abuse   cases   appear   to go undetected. Proposed Legislation. Proposals   have   been   introduced to curb or  eliminate the Medicare tax avoidance strategy   but Congress has yet to act.  The goal is to place S corporations on a level playing field with partnerships and LLCs and curb gaming of the system   by service providers to S corporations. The most recent   version of a proposal was advanced   by the Obama administration   and   would   have subjected S  corporation shareholders who materially participate in professional service businesses (e.g., law, accounting, health,   consulting,   architecture, performing arts, athletics) to  self-employment tax   on   their   entire share of an S corporation’s active  business   income. Owners   who do not materially   participate also would   have been taxable   but   only on   an amount equal to reasonable compensation, if any, for services they   provided to the   business.281 A more refined approach  was   taken by  former Ways and Means   Committee   chairman   Dave Camp in his Tax   Reform Act of 2014. The Camp proposal also would   have   extended  the self-employment tax to S  corporation   business income   passing   through  to shareholders who materially   participate but,   in recognition   that some business income may be a return on   capital rather than labor, it would  274 750  F.Supp. 421  (D.Ariz.1990).  275 57   F.3d   1076 (9th   Cir.1995). 276 918   F.2d   90   (9th   Cir.1990).

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  provide a nonlabor income deduction” generally   equal to 30 percent of net  business income.?82 Fringe Benefits. Fringe benefits paid by an S corporation to its shareholder-employees also are subject to special treatment. Section 1372  provides that an S corporation shall be  treated as a partnership for purposes  of employee fringe benefits, and any shareholder owning either more than  two   percent of the corporation’s outstanding stock or more than two   percent  of the total voting power of all stock will be treated as a partner. As a result,  an S corporation seldom can provide benefits, such as   a medical reimbursement plan or group-term life insurance, which are deductible by the corporation and excludable   from gross income of its shareholder-  employees.?83  I.   TAX   POLICY   ISSUES:   SUBCHAPTER   K   VS.  SUBCHAPTER   S284  The   check-the-box   elective   classification   regime   discussed   in Chapter   1 made   it easier   for virtually   any   closely held business   to obtain  pass-through   taxation   treatment.   This   has   resurrected   the longstanding  debate   on   the   most   desirable   structure   for   a   pass-through   system.   The excerpt   below,   from   a   study   by   the   Joint   Committee   on   Taxation,  compares   the   tax   treatment   of   partnerships   and   §S corporations   and surveys   the   competing   views   on   the   need   to   retain   two   different   pass- through   regimes.  Joint   Committee   on   Taxation,   Review   of Selected  Entity   Classification   and   Partnership   Tax   Issues  (JCS-6-97) 23-25 (April 8, 1997).  Need   for multiple   sets   of rules for pass-through   entities  [The   issuance of final check-the-box classification regulations raises  a set of issues regarding] whether there is a continuing   need in the   tax law for parallel pass-through   systems for general   business activities.# Although S  corporations   (and their shareholders)   generally are treated similarly to partnerships   (and their partners),   significant   differences  exist, some of which favor S  corporations   while   others   favor partnerships.  For example, the items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit   of a  partnership   generally are taken into account   by a partner   pursuant to  282 For a detailed   description, see Joint Comm. on Taxation,   Technical   Explanation of  the  Tax   Reform Act of 2014: Title I-Tax Reform for Individuals   79-85   (JCX-12-14, Feb.   26,  2014). 283 For   special   rules   relating to health   insurance, see   I.R.C. § 162(J)(1), (5), and Rev.   Rul.  91-26,   1991-1 C.B.   184.  284 See   generally   Eustice, “Subchapter   S Corporations   and   Partnerships: A Search for the  Pass Through   Paradigm   (Some   Preliminary   Proposals),”   39 Tax L. Rev. 345   (1984); Schwidetzky,   “Integrating   Subchapters   K  and   S—Just   Do It,” 62  Tax   Lawyer 749   (2009).  42 Eliminating   the two-tier   corporate   tax  system,   perhaps   through   some   form   of  corporate  integration,   could   also minimize   the  need for  multiple   sets of rules   for pass-through entities,   but  is beyond   the scope   of this   discussion.  731

732  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  the partnership agreement (or in accordance with the partners’ interest in the partnership if the agreement does not provide for an   allocation) so  long as such allocation has substantial economic effect.42 Because of the  one-class-of-stock rule for S corporations (sec. 1361(b)(1)(D)),   the items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit   of an S corporation cannot be separately allocated to a particular shareholder, but are taken into account by all the shareholders on a per-share, per-day basis. Thus, partnerships generally are considered to be a more flexible vehicle for purposes of allocating particular entity-level items to investors. Another   important   difference   making   partnerships   more   flexible than   S corporations   is the   treatment   of entity-level   debt,   for purposes   of the   owner’s   basis   in   his   interest.   A   partner   includes   partnership-level  debt   in   the   basis   of his   interest   (sec.   752),   whereas   an   S   corporation shareholder   does   not   (sec.   1367).   The   amount   of   the   partner’s   or   S  corporation   shareholder’s   basis   in his   interest   serves   as   a   limit   on   the amount   of losses   that can   be passed   through   (secs.   704(d),   1366(d)),   which makes   increases   in basis   for entity-level   debt   important. The   sale of stock in an   S corporation   generally   results   in capital   gain  or loss to the selling shareholder.   The   sale of an   interest   in a partnership  also   generally   gives   rise to capital   gain   or   loss, but   gives   rise to ordinary income   to   the   selling   partner   to   the   extent   attributable   to   unrealized receivables   and certain   inventory   items   (sec.   751). The distribution of appreciated   property by an S corporation to a shareholder (as a dividend, in redemption of shares, or in liquidation) is  treated as  a taxable sale  of such property. Any gain is allocated to all the  shareholders on a per-share, per day basis and increases the  shareholder’s   adjusted   bases in  their shares. The distributee shareholder  then   reduces his basis by the amount of the   distribution (i.e., fair market  value of the distributed   property) and takes a fair market value basis in  the   property. By contrast,   the   distribution of appreciated   property by a  partnership to  a partner   generally is not treated as a taxable sale   of the  property (sec. 731).  An existing C corporation may elect to be  treated as anS§ corporation on a tax-free   basis, subject to certain   special rules. Converting   C corporations are subject to corporate-level tax   on   the recapture of LIFO benefits,44   on certain built-in gains   recognized   within a 10-year   period  after conversion,4® and on certain   passive investment   income   earned  43 Sections 704(a) and (b). The   determination of whether an   allocation has   substantial  economic effect is complex (Treas.   Reg. sec. 1.704—1(b)(2)).  44 Section   1363(d).  45 Section   1374, For a discussion of how section   1374   allows   the conversion of By   (6)  corporation to S  corporation to be treated more   favorably   than the  liquidation of a C corporation  into a sole proprietorship or a partnership,   despite  the economic   equivalence of  the  transactions  see,  letter to Chairman   Dan   Rostenkowski   from   Ronald A. Pearlman,   Chief of  Staff  of  the jane Committee on Taxation, recommending several   simplification   proposals,   reprinted in  Committee on Ways   and   Means,   Written   Proposals on Tax   Simplification (WMCP 101-27), May  25,   1990, p.   24.   In   his   1995   and   1997   budget   messages to the   Congress,   President   Chaton  recommended that   section   1374   be   repealed for C   corporations   above a   certain   size. [Later

CHAPTER 15 S CORPORATIONS  while the corporation retains its former C corporate earnings and  profits.46 The conversion of a C corporation to a partnership (or sole proprietorship) is treated as a liquidation of the entity, taxable to both  the corporation and its shareholders. The   rules   of subchapter   C generally   apply   to   an   S corporation   and  its shareholders.   Thus,   for example,   an   S corporation   may   merge   into   a  C   corporation   (or   vice   versa)   on   a   tax-free   basis.   Similar   rules   do   not  apply   to combinations   of C corporations   and   partnerships. Individual   partners   treated   as   general   partners   generally   are subject   to self-employment   tax on   their   distributive   shares   of partnership  income.   Shareholders   of   an   S   corporation   are   not   subject   to   self-  employment   tax   on   S corporation   earnings,   but   are   subject   to payroll   tax to the   extent   they receive   salaries   or wages   from   the corporation. Partnerships,   LLCs   treated   as partnerships,   and   S corporations   may be treated   differently   for State   income   or franchise   tax   purposes. Continuing   utility   of S corporations  If an   LLC   can   provide   limited   liability   to   all   owners   and   achieve  pass-through   status   as   a   partnership   under   the   check-the-box  regulations   (or under   the   Service’s   prior   revenue   rulings   on   LLCs),   the  need   for   S corporations   could   be   questioned.   Particularly   in light   of the  growing   use   of LLCs,   it could   be   argued   that   the   great   flexibility   of the partnership   tax rules   outweigh   the principal   advantage   of S corporations: relative   simplicity.   Thus,   it is argued   that   the   rules   for   S corporations  could   be repealed   without   detriment   to taxpayers.47 Others   say   the continued   existence   of subchapter   S is worthwhile.   A corporate   charter   is a prerequisite   imposed   by regulators   for some   trades or businesses   (e.g., for depository   institutions   or to hold   certain   licenses),  and   LLCs   may   not   meet   such   regulatory   requirements.   Moreover,   the  corporate   form   is a   familiar,   time-tested   format,   while   the   LLC   form   is  new   and   unfamiliar   (particularly   where   a business   undertakes   interstate  commerce).   Subchapter   S supporters   further   point   out   that   the   rules   of  subchapter   S are   much   simpler   than   the rules   of subchapter   K.48   Others point   to   specific   advantages   of subchapter   S   over   the   partnership   tax rules   (primarily   the   ability   to   convert   from   C   to   S   corporation   status  proposals made by the Clinton administration   would   have   repealed Section   1374 for C-to-S  conversions of corporations   with a value of more   than   $5 million at the time of conversion   and  4reated the transaction as   a taxable   liquidation of  the C corporation   followed by a contribution  of  the assets to an S  corporation   by the  recipient   shareholders.

Schwidetzky, “Is   It Time to Give   the S Corporation a Proper Burial?”   15 Virginia  Tax   Review 591   (1996). 48 However, it must be   pointed out   that   partners of a partnership   may opt for  a simple,  subchapter-S like structure if they so  desire.   It could   be  said that the  check-the-box   regulations expand the   appeal of subchapter S,  because   prior to those   regulations,   only  entities   structured as corporations for  State   law   purposes   could   elect S corporation   status, whereas   now, a  State- law   partnership or LLC can   be   classified   as   a corporation   for  tax   purposes   and elect S  status (provided   applicable   requirements   are   met).  733

734  TAXATION OF S CORPORATIONS PART 3  generally without current corporate tax   on appreciation, and the availability of tax-free reorganization rules for business combinations  and reorganizations). At least   until LLC interests are as easily issued in  capital markets as traditional corporate stock, the S corporation may  continue to be an   attractive   vehicle in which to start a business, if it is  anticipated that it will later go  public. Finally, any repeal of subchapter S would require rules providing for the treatment of existing S  corporations.?9  Whether   or   not   it is advisable   to retain   both   the   partnership   rules and   the   S corporation   rules,   some   argue   that   the   complexity   of either  regime   is excessive   for small   businesses,   and   a new,   much   simpler   pass- through   system   should   be   provided   for   small   businesses   that   would   be  consistent   with   the   new   simplicity   for   choice   of entity   under   the   check- the-box   regulations.®°   A significant   question,   under   such   an   approach,   is  the   definition   of a small   business,   which   could   depend   on   the   number   of  owners,   the   value   of the   entity’s   assets,   the   amount   of its   gross   or   net  income   (if any),   or   some   combination   of these   or   other   factors.   Related  questions   involve   the   treatment   of businesses   that   grow   (or fluctuate   in  size),   crossing   the   definitional   line,   and   the   treatment   of tax   attributes imported   from   a more   complex   tax regime.   Weighing   of simplicity   against accuracy   of income   measurement   and   allocation   would   be   a   factor   in designing   a simpler   regime.  Others would argue that there is nothing   inherently complex in the application of the partnership tax   rules to most small business transactions. Small   businesses   today can achieve the effect of a simplified  partnership   regime for most common business arrangements. Mandating  the  use of specific rules for small business would   deny them the flexibility  of present   law partnership rules and, it could   be  argued, would represent a competitive disadvantage relative to larger businesses.  NOTE  The debate on how pass-through entities should be   taxed comes   and  goes, with   recurring themes   and timeless arguments.   The latest burst of  energy   was in 2013, when the House Ways and Means   Committee released a provocative   discussion draft with   two   reform options.285 The less ambitious Option 1 would make a handful of specific changes to the S  corporation rules,  such as reducing the bite   of the   Section   1375 tax on   excessive   passive  investment   income,   extending the time to make an § election, ameliorating  49 See, for example, the letter   of July 25, 1995, from Leslie B. Samuels,   Assistant  Treasury   Secretary   (Tax Policy) to Senator   Orrin   Hatch,   suggesting possible   legislative proposals to allow S   corporations to elect partnership status or   to apply the check-the-box regulations to S corporations. ee   American   Law Institute, Federal   Income   Tax   Project—Taxation of Pass-Through  Entities, Memorandum No.   2 96-105 (Sept.   2, 1996)   (G.

Two of the Option 1 proposals—to make   permanent the  reduction of the Section 1374 recognition   period to  five years and to limit a  shareholder’s downward basis adjustment resulting from an S corporation’s charitable   contribution of appreciated property to the adjusted basis of that  property—were enacted into law in late 2015. The S corporation provisions  in Option 1 were intended to encourage more C corporations to elect S status and provide greater flexibility to current S corporations in  their day-to-day  operations. Option 1 also included a list of far more controversial changes to  the tax treatment of partnerships   and partners in Subchapter K. The   more   radical   Option   2 would   overhaul   the   current   Subchapter   K  and   S regimes   by replacing   them   with   a uniform   set of rules   available   to most  privately   held   business   entities.   Subchapter   S would   no   longer   exist,   and   a less   flexible   and   somewhat   more   user-friendly   Subchapter   K would   remain  and   apply   to any   legal form   of closely held   business   entity   if its owners   elect pass-through   tax   treatment.   Among   the   many   changes   affecting   electing corporations   would   be elimination   of the   one-class-of-stock   and   shareholder eligibility   restrictions;   allowing   entity   debt   to be included   in a shareholder’s  basis;   and   permitting   limited   types   of special   allocations   by agreement   of the  entity’s   owners. In 2014,   then   House   Ways   and   Means   Committee   chairman   Dave   Camp followed   up   with   his   sweeping   discussion   draft   of The   Tax   Reform   Act   of 2014.286   The   provisions   affecting   pass-through   entities   were   largely   drawn from   Option   1 of the   2013   proposals,   reflecting   a more   incremental   approach to   reform   rather   than   a   radical   overhaul.   Chairman   Camp’s   initiative stimulated   much   discussion   when   it was   first   released   but,   like   so   many  earlier   proposals,   it has   faded   into   the   sunset   where   it has   so   far   only  gathered   dust.   Many   of the   S   corporation   proposals   are   uncontroversial,  however,   and   could   become   law   either   as   part   of a targeted   tax   bill or if and  when   comprehensive   business   tax   reform   legislation   is enacted.   The   2014 proposals   are   in line with   the view   expressed   by many   practitioners   and   the  small   business   community   that   Subchapter   S continues   to play   a valuable role   and   should   be expanded   and   improved   rather   than   discarded   in favor   of a unified   pass-through   system.?87  286   See   Chapter   1H3,   supra. 287   See, e.g., Sicular,   “Subchapter   S at 55—Has   Time   Passed   This Passthrough   By? Maybe  Not,”   68 Tax   Law.   185   (2014); Yin,   Comments   on   the Taxation   of Passthrough   Entities,   140 Tax Notes   358   (July 22, 2013).
