Legal advisors to the earliest American corporations spent much of their time defining the relationship between the corporation and the state and developing hoary doctrines to regulate corporate governance and control. It was not until late in the 19th century that the genteel world of corporate law was jolted by the emergence of the income tax as a principal government revenue raising device. The life of the corporate lawyer would never be the same again. From the ili-fated Income Tax of 1894, which at the time was viewed as a Socialist plot because it imposed a two percent tax on individual and corporate net income,1 to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909, which imposed a modest one percent tax on corporate net income over $\\$ 5,000$ 2 to the Sixteenth Amendment and beyond, the income tax gradually came to influence how corporations conducted their affairs. It is now well acknowledged, though often lamented, that taxes have invaded virtually every aspect of American business life. They shape and often twist management decisions and generally are an unpleasant distraction to those who would prefer to devote their full resources to the pursuit of profit. ",

Congress, having decided to treat the corporation as a separate taxpaying entity, went on to craft what has become known as a \"double tax regime.\"4 Under current law, a corporate tax is imposed annually, at the 21 percent flat rate set forth in Section 11, on the taxable income of a corporation. That income is taxed again if and when a corporation distributes dividends to its shareholders. Those dividends are not deductible by the distributing corporation but are taxed to its shareholders at rates that vary depending on whether the shareholder is an individual or a corporation, and they are not taxed at all to tax-exempt shareholders such as charities and retirement funds.5 Because the corporation is treated as a separate taxable entity, transactions between corporations and their shareholders are taxable events unless they qualify for nonrecognition treatment. The tax consequences of these transactions and other major changes and adjustments in a corporation are governed by Subchapter C (Sections 301 to 385) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a challenging and fascinating body of law that is the principal subject of this book. Corporations subject to the double tax regime also draw their identity (and monogram) from Subchapter C. Collectively, the Code refers to them as “C corporations.\"6 ",

A partner's share of partnership losses for a taxable year are deductible only to the extent of the partner's basis in her partnership interest.8 These losses also may be subject to other timing limitations.9 Ongoing adjustments to the basis of a partner's interest in the partnership ensure that income and losses are not taxed (or deducted) twice.10 ",

The results were a strengthened double tax regime, an increase in the tax costs of operating a profitable business as a C corporation, and greater pressure on techniques to reduce these costs. ",

The origins of the LLC in the United States can be traced to the search by foreign investors in the oil and gas industry for a U.S. business entity that would combine limited liability protection for all owners with one level of taxation. Because nonresident aliens may not own stock in an S corporation, the investors' objectives could not be met using the corporate form. So they began lobbying state legislatures, and by the late 1970s Wyoming had enacted the first domestic limited liability company statute.24 LLCs were not practically viable, however, until the Internal Revenue Service ruled, first privately and then in a 1989 published ruling, that a Wyoming LLC would be treated as a partnership rather than a corporation for tax purposes.25 ",

For much of our tax history, the policy decision to tax long-term capital gains at substantially lower rates than ordinary income influenced the tax planner's agenda. Rather than paying dividends, tax advisors devised techniques to\"bail out' earning at capital gains rates. A “bailout' was a distribution of earnings in a transaction, such as a redemption of stock, that qualifies as a \"sale or exchange,\" enabling the shareholder to recover all or part of her stock basis and to benefit from preferential capital gain treatment on any realized gain. In some cases, such as where the shareholder died and the basis of her stock was stepped up to its date-of-death value, the bailout could be accomplished tax-free.28 Over the years, Congress responded with complex anti-bailout provisions to ensure that distributions resembling dividends would be taxed as ordinary income.29 ",

Transactions that qualify for nonrecognition treatment may go forward on a tax-free basis on the theory that they are mere changes in form resulting in a continuity of investment.

Suppose a foreign corporation has a low effective tax rate and under its country's tax laws it is allwed to return overseas profits without additional tax. If that company wants to expand, a U.S. firm with overseas businesses may be an attractive partner. The foreign corporate suitor would look to (1) reduce the effective tax rate on the U.S. partner's future overseas business profits, and (2) repatriate the U.S. corporation's locked-out profits without additional tax. The point is that these strategies often made a U.S. company with foreign operations a more attractive acquisition target for a foreign corporation than a potential domestic suitor. Some highly publicized takeovers of U.S. firms by foreign corporations have involved Canadian companies, including ones in the pharmaceutical industry and the acquisition of Burger King by the Tim Horton chain. Canada generally does not tax overseas business profits, and it often allows repatriation of foreign profits without additional tax. While these acquisitions arguably had a business justification, it is also clear that tax advantages were sought to improve after-tax returns.37 Although the IRS attempted to curb inversions by making the desired tax benefits more difficult to achieve,38 resourceful tax advisors devised methods to circumvent these administrative obstacles.

In the previous edition of this text, we noted that other suggested approaches included reducing corporate tax rates and ending the incentive for lock-out of foreign profits and predicted the possibility of legislation as part of a more comprehensive tax reform effort. The 2017 Act did not disappoint. In addition to reducing the corporate income tax rate, major changes were made to the taxation of foreign income earned by U.S. corporations by the adoption of a modified territorial system of taxation, the creation of a new tax subsidy for exports by U.S. corporations, and the imposition of a mandatory repatriation tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings.39 A principal goal of the 2017 legislation was to rebalance the Code's tax incentives to encourage U.S. and foreign corporations to conduct more of their operations in the United States.

        "text": "The Broader Business Enterprise Tax Policy Debate. The explosive growth of the LLC as a \"best of all worlds' legal form and the diminished role of the corporate income tax have breathed new life into the broader business enterprise tax policy debate. Consider the following questions, which focus on fundamental structural issues that were not addressed in the 2017 Act. Why does the Internal Revenue Code have two separate pass-through tax regimes for closely held business enterprises, one (Subchapter K) for partnerships and LLCs and the other (Subchapter S) for certain corporations, each with different qualification standards and operative provisions?40 If a single pass-through regime were adopted, would Subchapter K be preferable to Subchapter S, or would some combination of the two be the best approach?41 Why are C corporations singled out for a double tax regime? Is it because they enjoy limited liability under state law? Presumably not, because most LLCs are not subject to Subchapter C. Does the rise of the LLC undermine the policy underlying the double tax and threaten to destroy the corporate tax base? Would it make more sense to limit Subchapter C to large corporations (based on revenues) or publicly traded entities? Or should there be a single one-tier tax regime for all business income without regard to the organizational form?42 And how would U.S. multinational corporations be taxed under a revised regime? ",

But in many situations, the modest rate advantage for C corporations was outweighed by the fact that pass-through entities are subject to only one level of tax. These relationships were radically altered by the 2017 Act, where Congress rejected eliminating the double tax regime applicable to C corporations and instead moderated its bite by lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent—a 40 percent decrease from the top 35 percent rate that had been in place for many years. As enacted, this rate cut is said to be permanent in the sense that it will not automatically expire after a certain period of time but, of course, nothing is ever \"permanent\" in the Internal Revenue Code because of the ever-shifting political winds.

Does this mean that C corporations are once again preferable to pass-through entities? The answer is .. . maybe or . ..it depends. The benefit of the 21 percent corporate income tax rate must be balanced against the additional tax cost of moving corporate earnings to the individual shareholder level. Because a C corporation is treated as a separate taxable entity, its profits are subject to tax when distributed as dividends or when the shareholders sell their stock for a gain. Gains from the sale of corporate stock and qualified dividends generally are taxed at preferential long-term capital gains rates rather than the higher ordinary income rates,49 reducing but not eliminating the sting of the double tax regime. This advantage is partially offset for high-income taxpayers who are subject to the 3.8 percent tax on net investment income. After taking into account the 21 percent corporate rate and assuming a C corporation's after-tax earnings are distributed to individual shareholders as qualified dividends, the maximum combined federal rate is approximately 39.8 percent, down from 50.47 percent under the pre-2018 rates.50 ",

For example, owneremployees of a C corporation would distribute profits in the form of salary and fringe benefits that were tax-deductible by the corporation and, in the case of many fringe benefits, excludable by the owner-employee. Shareholders also loaned funds or leased property to a C corporation and withdrew earnings in the form of tax-deductible interest or rent. The viability of these strategies to mitigate the impact of the double tax must be reevaluated in light of the fact that the corporate income tax rate is so much lower than the highest individual rates, and compensation is taxable at the highest individual rates and also subject to employment taxes. C corporations in some lines of business can still reduce their tax liability by taking advantage of numerous corporate tax benefits, such as the ability to expense the cost of depreciable property (at least for the immediate future) and targeted tax benefits for manufacturing, research and development, and specialized industries. The most recent available data indicates that in 2013, nearly 49 percent of all C corporations filing returns reported no taxable income, and only 31 percent of C corporations had any corporate tax liability after tax credits were taken into account.51 ",

A major takeaway from the 2017 Act is that some profitable closely held businesses that previously chose to operate as sole proprietorships or pass-through entities to avoid the double tax may want to reconsider using C corporations because of the lower corporate tax rate. As in the good old days, corporations once again may be \"an attractive refuge\" but only when strategies can be employed to minimize, defer or, where possible, completely avoid a second layer of tax at the shareholder level. If otherwise feasible, the ideal tax plan would be to avoid paying dividends and reinvest the earnings in the corporation where they will be taxed at the preferential 21 percent rate until the business is sold or liquidated. An even better result for a closely held business with concentrated ownership would be to postpone any sales or liquidation until after the senior generation of owners dies. At that point, the basis of the decedent's stock will be stepped up to its fair market value as of the date of death,55 and the stock can be sold at little or no tax cost. For individual shareholders, the opportunity to exclude all or part of the gain on the sale of qualified small business stock also may be an influential factor in choosing a C corporation. ",

When a pass-through tax regime is the desired alternative for a closely held business, the owners must choose among three legal forms: a partnership, a limited liability company, or an S corporation.

S corporations are limited to 100 shareholders (although members of a \"family,\" broadly defined, are counted as one shareholder), and they may not have more than one class of stock.61 Subchapter K is much more flexible than Subchapter S. To accommodate different types of owners, partnerships and LLCs may make special allocations of partnership income and deduction items, while shareholders of an S corporation must include corporate income and loss in proportion to their stock ownership.62 Thus, partners may agree to share certain income or deductions disproportionately, and the agreement will be respected for tax purposes if it accurately reflects their economic business deal. In most cases, partnerships and LLCs (but not S corporations) also can distribute appreciated property in kind without immediate recognition of taxable gain. If an entity will hold appreciated property that it anticipates distributing to its owners at some point prior to a liquidation, a strong tax preference exists for structuring the activity through a Subchapter K entity rather than an S corporation.

In extreme cases, such as where little or no salary is paid and the S corporation simply distributes its net income to its sole owner, the Service likely will reclassify all or part of the distribution, or even the shareholder's pro rata share of undistributed corporate profits, as wages for employment tax purposes.

In 1997, the Service issued proposed regulations to clarify these issues.73 These regulations generally would have prevented partners and LLC members who provided more than 500 hours of service for their firms in a taxable year from taking advantage of the limited partner exclusion from self-employment tax. But after a storm of protest, Congress imposed a one-year moratorium74 and, even though it expired, no final regulations had been adopted as of late 2019. In the meantime, the courts entered the fray. In an influential Tax Court decision, attorney-partners in a limited liability law firm partnership were not allowed to use the limited partner exclusion from self-employment taxes.75 This holding is consistent with the functional approach taken by the 1997 proposed regulations and undercuts the aggressive position that LLC members qualify for the “limited partner' exclusion from selfemployment tax even if they are active service providers to a business with nominal capital.76 ",

To prevent any tax savings that might result from the use of a fiscal year, personal service corporations making a Section 444 election must make certain minimum distributions (e.g., primarily of compensation) to employeeowners during the portion of the employee's fiscal year that ends on December 31.95 If these minimum distribution requirements are not met, the electing corporation must defer certain otherwise currently deductible payments (e.g., compensation) to employee-owners.96 A personal service corporation that establishes a business purpose for a fiscal year is not required to make a Section 444 election and is not subject to these distribution requirements and deduction limitations.97 ",

These goals could not be achieved in a C or S corporation. The Service's effort to convince the courts that limited partnerships should be classified as \"associations” was unsuccessful,i4 but it continued to issue stringent guidelines for limited partnerships seeking a favorable classification ruling.115 Most tax advisors bypassed the ruling process and were able to structure limited partnerships that would avoid \"association\" classification based on a well reasoned opinion of counsel.

As a result, investors in PTPs will qualify to deduct 20 percent of their allocable share of the PTP's qualified business income without regard to the general limitation imposed on high-income taxpayers.145 Many PTPs qualifying for this exemption engage in active natural resources businesses, such as exploration, mining and production, refining, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas. The scope of this escape hatch came under scrutiny after several large private investment firms \"went public\" using a PTP structure under which they offered publicly traded limited partnership interests. One of the largest IPO transactions involved The Blackstone Group, a global asset firm with approximately $\\$ 88.4$ billion under management at the time it went public. In addition to providing advisory services, Blackstone manages a variety of investment pools, including private equity and venture capital funds, real estate partnerships, and hedge funds. During its pre-IPO history, Blackstone qualified for pass-through tax treatment, as a limited partnership, and it sought to continue avoiding the corporate-level tax as a public company by employing the PTP structure and qualifying for the passive income exception even though the bulk of its profits are derived from an active money management business.14 $\\mathrm { ~ \\normalfont ~ { ~ I ~ n ~ 2 0 1 9 ~ } ~ }$ however, Blackstone changed its mind and announced its intention to become a C corporation. The reduction in the corporate tax rate and the disfavor of institutional investors and stock indexes for the PTP structure, as well as the complexity of tax compliance for individual shareholders, influenced Blackstone and several other large firms to become C corporations.147 ",

Obviously, Moline's separate-entity principle would be significantly compromised if shareholders of closely held corporations could, by clothing the corporation with some attributes of agency with respect to particular assets, leave themselves free at the end of the tax year to make a claim—perhaps even a good-faith claim—of either agent or owner status, depending upon which choice turns out to minimize their tax liability. The Commissioner does not have the resources to audit and litigate the many cases in which agency status could be thought debatable. Hence, the Commissioner argues, in this shareholder context he can reasonably demand that the taxpayer meet a prophylactically clear test of agency. ",

The parties have debated at length the significance of our opinion in National Carbide Corp. v. Commissioner, supra. In that case, three corporations that were wholly owned subsidiaries of another corporation agreed to operate their production plants as \"agents'\" for the parent, transferring to it all profits except for a nominal sum. The subsidiaries reported as gross income only this sum, but the Commissioner concluded that they should be taxed on the entirety of the profits because they were not really agents. We agreed, reasoning first, that the mere fact of the parent's control over the subsidiaries did not establish the existence of an agency, since such control is typical of all shareholder-corporation relationships, id., 336 U.S. at 429–434, 69 S.Ct., at 730–732; and second, that the agreements to pay the parent all profits above a nominal amount were not determinative since income must be taxed to those who actually earn it without regard to anticipatory assignment, id., at 435–436, 69 S.Ct., at 733-734. We acknowledged, however, that there was such a thing as \"a true corporate agent . .. of [an] owner-principal,\" id., at 437, 69 S.Ct., at 734, and proceeded to set forth four indicia and two requirements of such status, the sum of which has become known in the lore of federal income tax law as the \"six National Carbide factors\": ",

To take the last first: The Commissioner argues that here the corporation's business purpose with respect to the property at issue was not \"the carrying on of the normal duties of an agent,\" since it was acting not as the agent but rather as the owner of the property for purposes of Kentucky's usury laws. We do not agree. It assuredly was not acting as the owner in fact, since respondents represented themselves as the principals to all parties concerned with the loans. Indeed, it was the lenders themselves who required the use of a corporate nominee. Nor does it make any sense to adopt a contrary-tofact legal presumption that the corporation was the principal, imposing a federal tax sanction for the apparent evasion of Kentucky's usury law. To begin with, the Commissioner has not established that these transactions were an evasion. Respondents assert without contradiction that use of agency arrangements in order to permit higher interest was common practice, and it is by no means clear that the practice violated the spirit of the Kentucky law, much less its letter. It might well be thought that the borrower does not generally require usury protection in a transaction sophisticated enough to employ a corporate agent— assuredly not the normal modus operandi of the loan shark. That the statute positively envisioned corporate nominees is suggested by a provision which forbids charging the higher corporate interest rates \"to a corporation, the principal asset of which shall be the ownership of a one (1) or two (2) family dwelling.\" Ky.Rev.Stat. \\$ 360.025(2) (1987)——which would seem to prevent use of the nominee device for ordinary homemortgage loans. In any event, even if the transaction did run afoul of the usury law, Kentucky, like most States, regards only the lender as the usurer, and the borrower as the victim. See Ky.Rev.Stat. S 360.020 (1987) (lender liable to borrower for civil penalty), 8 360.990 (lender guilty of misdemeanor). Since the Kentucky statute imposed no penalties upon the borrower for allowing himself to be victimized, nor treated him as in pari delictu, but to the contrary enabled him to pay back the principal without any interest, and to sue for double the amount of interest already paid (plus attorney's fees), see Ky.Rev.Stat. $\\ S ~ 3 6 0 . 0 2 0$ (1972), the United States would hardly be vindicating Kentucky law by depriving the usury victim of tax advantages he would otherwise enjoy. In sum, we see no basis in either fact or policy for holding that the corporation was the principal because of the nature of its participation in the loans. ",

The meaning of National Carbide's fifth factor is, at the risk of understatement, not entirely clear. Ultimately, the relations between a corporate agent and its ownerprincipal are always dependent upon the fact of ownership, in that the owner can cause the relations to be altered or terminated at any time. Plainly that is not what was meant, since on that interpretation all subsidiary-parent agencies would be invalid for tax purposes, a position which the National Carbide opinion specifically disavowed. We think the fifth National Carbide factor—so much more abstract than the otherswas no more and no less than a generalized statement of the concern, expressed earlier in our own discussion, that the separate-entity doctrine of Moline not be subverted.

We see no basis, however, for holding that unequivocal evidence can only consist of the rigid requirements (arm's-length dealing plus agency fee) that the Commissioner suggests. Neither of those is demanded by the law of agency, which permits agents to be unpaid family members, friends, or associates. See Restatement (Second) of Agency S\\$ 16, 21, 22 (1958). It seems to us that the genuineness of the agency relationship is adequately assured, and tax-avoiding manipulation adequately avoided, when the fact that the corporation is acting as agent for its shareholders with respect to a particular asset is set forth in a written agreement at the time the asset is acquired, the corporation functions as agent and not principal with respect to the asset for all purposes, and the corporation is held out as the agent and not principal in all dealings with third parties relating to the asset.

Many closely held businesses are able to avoid the double tax by operating as partnerships, LLCs, or S corporations. Even if they do not qualify for pass-through treatment, well-advised closely held C corporations historically engaged in \"self-help\" integration techniques (such as payments of deductible compensation or interest) or took advantage of targeted tax breaks to avoid the sting of the corporate tax. Moreover, a large of amount of the taxable income of publicly traded corporations is only taxed once, at the corporate level, because of the significant concentration of stock held by tax-exempt pension funds and charitable endowments. Finally, transition from the current system to an integration model would present logistical challenges and years of complexity as the new rules are phased in. ",

The potential integration models fall into two broad categories. The first, referred to as \"full” or \"complete\" integration, would eliminate the corporate income tax and apply a passthrough taxing system to C corporations and their shareholders. A leading alternative is “partial\"” integration, which typically contemplates different types of tax relief for dividends paid by a corporation. Variations include giving shareholders a tax credit equal to a percentage of dividends paid or allowing shareholders to exclude from gross income a portion of dividends received during the year. Alternatively, the corporation could be permitted to deduct some or all of the dividends it pays its shareholders. The excerpts below survey the major integration prototypes. ",

The two levels of tax on corporate form income (entity and individual level), as compared to the single individual level tax imposed on pass-through entities (S-corps, partnerships, LLCs), create a bias against the corporate form of organization; this in turn limits investors' access to publicly traded equity investment, which may impose a particular burden to smaller investors who are less likely to have significant access to equity investments in pass-through entities. To the extent that the two levels of tax impose a higher level of tax on investment generally, the incentive to save is reduced. The resulting increase in the cost of capital needed to finance new investment will lead to lower capital formation, thereby reducing future output and productivity. An additional distortion resulting from the present law corporate income tax rules is the incentive to finance new investments from debt rather than equity on account of the deductibility of interest payments on debt but no comparable deduction for dividends paid on equity.39 Over-reliance on debt financing can increase bankruptcy risk. Finally, there may be incentives created for the retention of earnings in the corporation, which may lead to distortions in the allocation of capital to the extent that corporations with current earnings have less favorable investment opportunities than would their shareholders.40 In addition, present law results in considerable complexity and tax planning as taxpayers seek to structure the most tax-favorable form of doing business and providing returns to investors.

Under present law, although the Code provides rules for imposing separate tax at the corporate and at the shareholder level, this does not always result in actual payment of two levels of tax. In some cases, the amounts that are distributed to shareholders may have borne less than a ful tax at the corporate level due to the operation of various deductions, deferrals, or other provisions that have reduced or eliminated corporate level tax. Also, in some cases, shareholders are tax-exempt, or the rate of tax the shareholder may pay is reduced due to capital gains treatment, the lower rates for dividends of individuals, the dividendsreceived deduction for corporations, step-up in basis of stock at death, or other provisions. Thus, under present law, the combined individual and corporate tax rates on corporate earnings that are distributed to shareholders may not be as great as two full levels of tax, and may be less than a single full level of tax. If a decision were made to increase corporate integration, policy decisions would need to be made regarding those situations in which at least one level of tax should be collected and at which level (corporate or shareholder) it should be collected. Complexity would be involved in co-ordinating the tax results at the entity and individual levels. ",

For most of his two terms in office, President Obama agreed that corporate income tax rates should be reduced in exchange for a broader base, but he also promoted use of the tax system to stimulate certain types of economic activity, such as clean energy, research, education and jobs. As in the debate over integration, the business community has been divided. Some sectors would welcome a corporate tax rate reduction even if it means fewer deductions and credits. Others, especially businesses that can reduce their effective tax rates by using targeted tax breaks, were less enthusiastic. Owners of businesses operating as pass-through entities (such as partnerships, LLCs and S corporations) expressed concern that they would not benefit from a lower corporate income tax rate and might lose valuable tax breaks if the base is broadened. Further complicating the task was the treatment of U.S. multinational corporations—a critical piece in the corporate tax reform puzzle.

The Camp reform bill included repeal of many business-related exclusions, deductions and credits; repeal of the alternative minimum tax; reduction of corporate tax rates; and a long list of micro and macro changes to the tax treatment of pass-through entities.179 The Senate Finance Committee also was hard at work, first preparing an option paper on taxation of business income and entities180 and later issuing a Business Income Tax Bipartisan Working Group Report.181 The Working Group agreed on several familiar principles to drive business tax reform: (1) lowering tax rates to encourage economic growth and job creation and to create an internationally competitive tax code; (2) addressing structural biases (e.g., debt financing over equity); (3) promoting innovation (e.g., through a permanent research and development tax credit and source neutral incentives for energy production); and (4) simplifying the system.
